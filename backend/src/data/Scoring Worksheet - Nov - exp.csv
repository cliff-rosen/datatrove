2023-11-06,37677000,Efficacy and Safety of the Melanocortin Pan-Agonist PL9643 in a Phase 2 Study of Patients with Dry Eye Disease.,"Purpose: The melanocortin receptor pan-agonist PL9643, a potential therapy for ocular diseases, was investigated in a phase 2, 12-week study in patients with dry eye disease (DED). Methods: This was a placebo-controlled study evaluating efficacy and safety of thrice-daily PL9643. Placebo (vehicle) was similar to tears. Primary endpoints were intra-patient changes in inferior corneal fluorescein staining and ocular discomfort after 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints were changes in additional DED signs or symptoms. Multiple secondary endpoints were not adjusted for multiplicity. Patients with moderate or severe DED were analyzed in addition to the overall intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Results: In the ITT population (n = 160) the PL9643 group did not demonstrate significant treatment difference versus placebo at week 12/day 85 for the primary endpoints (P > 0.05). In patients with moderate or severe DED (n = 53), PL9643 treatment demonstrated either nominally significant (P < 0.05) or trending (P < 0.1) improvement over placebo in mean change from baseline at week 12/day 85 in several sign endpoints, including fluorescein staining in inferior, superior, corneal sum, and total sum regions; Lissamine Green staining in temporal, nasal, conjunctival sum, and total sum regions; and tear film breakup time. Conjunctival redness also showed (nonsignificant) improvement at week 12/day 85. There were no drug-related adverse events (AEs) and no drug-related discontinuations. Conclusions: PL9643 showed no significant efficacy for the ITT population; however, efficacy results across several signs and symptoms in the subpopulation of moderate to severe DED patients, the low number of ocular AEs, and no tolerability issues suggest that PL9643 shows promise as a therapeutic for DED.

2023-11-10,37749024,N-Terminal Pro B-Type Natriuretic Peptide as a Screening Tool for Inpatient Echocardiogram Requirement Among Patients With Suspected Heart Failure: Using NT-proBNP to Reduce Hospital Length of Stay.,"N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is a cardiac biomarker with diagnostic and prognostic utility in patients with heart failure (HF). Whether NT-proBNP can be used to triage inpatient transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) requirements, and whether this impacts hospital length of stay (LOS), is not clear.Clinical and biochemical data were prospectively recorded on all inpatients at Wollongong Hospital, NSW, Australia, who had a TTE ordered for suspected HF over a 6-month period. NT-proBNP was used to triage TTE priority, where high-priority inpatient TTE, lower-priority inpatient TTE and outpatient (OP) TTE were performed for serum NT-proBNPs of ≥900, 300-899 and <300, respectively. Outcomes were compared with a baseline cohort of HF inpatients in whom TTE requirement was not guided by NT-proBNP.A total of 236 patients were evaluated-31, 31, and 174 in the low, intermediate and high NT-proBNP cohorts, respectively, and 199 patients were in the baseline cohort. Average hospital LOS was significantly reduced in the study cohort compared to baseline (9.97 vs 13.87 days, p<0.001). Of the 31 patients with a very low NT-proBNP who were discharged for OP TTE, seven were readmitted within 30 days, though none were HF-related. There were no deaths at 30 days in the low or intermediate NT-proBNP groups.Using NT-proBNP to triage requirements for inpatient TTE reduces hospital LOS. A very low NT-proBNP may help identify which patients with suspected HF can be safely discharged for OP TTE.",yes,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, biomarker",natriuretic,heart failure,9
2023-11-03,37915546,"Can We Slow Down Biological Age Progression? Study Protocol for the proBNPage Reduction (PBAR) Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial (Effects of 4 ""Anti-Aging"" Food Supplements in Healthy Older Adults).","The availability of a simple and reliable marker of biological age might allow an acceleration of the research in the field of longevity extension. Previous studies suggest that this marker might be the N-terminal of B-type natriuretic peptide precursor (NT-proBNP), from which proBNPage, a biological age surrogate, can be calculated. Objectives of the study: 1) To fine-tune the method of proBNPage progression assessment and 2) To establish whether 4 ""anti-aging"" treatments, which provided promising results in previous studies, can modify proBNPage progression.This is a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial on 120 adults aged 65-80 years, free of cardiovascular diseases. Participants will be randomized into 3 groups: A) Coenzyme Q10 100 mg bid + Selenium 100 mcg; B) Resveratrol 350 mg bid + TA-65 (Astragalus Membranaceus extract) 100U; C) Placebo-1 bid + Placebo-2. They will be followed for 2 years and checked 8 times, to assess both proBNPage progression and treatment safety. Secondary variables (handgrip strength, aerobic capacity at the step test and quality of life) will also be assessed. Primary outcome will be the demonstration of significant changes of proBNPage, compared to baseline, in the 3 groups at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Secondary outcome will be the demonstration of similar changes of secondary variables. Statistical analyses will be mainly performed by repeated measures ANOVA (both according to intention to treat and per protocol) and paired t tests. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee Area Vasta Emilia Centro, Emilia-Romagna Region, ID: 64/2022/Sper/AOUBo. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05500742.The use of proBNPage as a surrogate of biological age may prove an easy method to select anti-aging treatments worthy of further, more complex assessments.",yes,no,no,human RCT,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",natriuretic,,7
2023-11-06,37657522,Glutamate Infusion Reduces Myocardial Dysfunction after Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting According to NT-proBNP: Summary of 2 Randomized Controlled Trials (GLUTAmate for Metabolic Intervention in Coronary Surgery [GLUTAMICS I-II]).,"Glutamate is reported to enhance the recovery of oxidative metabolism and contractile function of the heart after ischemia. The effect appears to be blunted in diabetic hearts. Elevated plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) reflects myocardial dysfunction. In the GLUTAmate for Metabolic Intervention in Coronary Surgery (GLUTAMICS) II trial, the proportion of patients with diabetes had nearly doubled to 47% compared with the cohort used for sample size estimation, and a significant effect on the postoperative rise in NT-proBNP was only observed in patients without diabetes.We aimed to summarize the pooled NT-proBNP results from both GLUTAMICS trials and address the impact of diabetes.Data from 2 prospective, randomized, double-blind multicenter trials with similar inclusion criteria and endpoints were pooled. Patients underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) ± valve procedure and had a left-ventricular ejection fraction of ≤0.30 or a European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II (EuroSCORE II) of ≥3.0 with at least 1 cardiac risk factor. Intravenous infusion of 0.125 M L-glutamic acid or saline at 1.65 mL/kg/h was started 10-20 min before reperfusion and continued for 150 min. The primary endpoint was the difference between preoperative and day 3 postoperative NT-proBNP levels.A total of 451 patients, 224 receiving glutamate and 227 controls, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Glutamate was associated with a reduced primary endpoint (5344 ± 5104 ng/L and 6662 ± 5606 ng/L in glutamate and control groups, respectively; P = 0.01). Postoperative mortality at ≤30 d was 0.9% and 3.5% (P = 0.11), whereas stroke at ≤24 h was 0.4% and 2.6% in glutamate and control groups, respectively (P = 0.12). No adverse events related to glutamate were observed. A significant interaction regarding the primary endpoint was only detected between glutamate and insulin-treated diabetes groups (P = 0.04). Among patients without insulin-treated diabetes, the primary endpoint was 5047 ± 4705 ng/L and 7001 ± 5830 ng/L in the glutamate and control groups, respectively (P = 0.001).Infusion of glutamate reduced the postoperative rise in NT-proBNP after CABG in medium- to high-risk patients.

2023-11-27,37993201,Semaglutide in Patients With Obesity and Heart Failure Across Mildly Reduced or Preserved Ejection Fraction.,"Many therapies for heart failure (HF) have shown differential impact across the spectrum of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).In this prespecified analysis, the authors assessed the effects of semaglutide across the baseline LVEF strata in patients with the obesity phenotype of HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) in the STEP-HFpEF (Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity and HFpEF) trial.STEP-HFpEF randomized 529 patients (263 semaglutide; 266 placebo). For this prespecified analysis, patients were categorized into 3 groups based on LVEF: 45% to 49% (n = 85), 50% to 59% (n = 215), and ≥60% (n = 229).At 52 weeks, semaglutide improved the dual primary endpoints of Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score (estimated treatment difference: EF [ejection fraction] 45%-49%: 5.0 points [95% CI: -2.7 to 12.8 points], EF 50%-59%: 9.8 points [95% CI: 5.0 to 14.6 points], and EF ≥60%: 7.4 points [95% CI: 2.8 to 12.0 points]; P interaction = 0.56) and body weight (EF: 45%-49%: -7.6 [95% CI: -10.7 to -4.4], EF 50%-59%: -10.6 [95% CI: -12.6 to -8.6] and EF ≥60%: -11.9 [95% CI: -13.8 to -9.9]; P interaction = 0.08), to a similar extent across LVEF categories. Likewise, LVEF did not influence the benefit of semaglutide on confirmatory secondary endpoints: 6-minute walk distance (P interaction = 0.19), hierarchal composite endpoint (P interaction = 0.43), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (P interaction = 0.26); or exploratory endpoint of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (P interaction = 0.96). Semaglutide was well-tolerated across LVEF categories.In patients with HFpEF and obesity, semaglutide 2.4 mg improved symptoms, physical limitations, and exercise function, and reduced inflammation and body weight to a similar extent across LVEF categories. These data support treatment with semaglutide in patients with the obesity phenotype of HFpEF regardless of LVEF.

2023-11-10,37427711,Efficacy and safety of macitentan for pulmonary hypertension: A meta-analysis.,"Our purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect and safety of macitentan in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension (PH).We retrieved the safety and efficacy of macitentan treatment for PH using PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE databases and clinicaltrials.gov. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool was used for literature screening and quality assessment. Data analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.4.1 and Stata/SE 15.1 software. Results are presented as standardization mean differences (SMDs) and odds ratio (OR).Meta-analysis of seven randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies and four non-RCT studies with 2769 patients was included, involving 723 in the macitentan group and 599 in the placebo group. The results of the study showed that macitentan had effectively decreased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) (SMD = -0.53, 95% CI: -0.77--0.29, p < 0.05), cardiac index (CI) (SMD = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.37-0.83, p < 0.05) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (SMD = -0.22, 95% CI: -0.40--0.03, p < 0.05). Furthermore, macitentan also significantly reduced PVR (SMD = -0.58, 95% CI: -0.80--0.35, p < 0.05), 6-min walk distance (6WMD) (SMD = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.15-0.50, p < 0.05), CI (SMD = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.28-0.69, p < 0.05), mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) (SMD = -0.43, 95% CI: -0.64--0.23, p < 0.05) and NT-proBNP (SMD = -0.55, 95% CI: -1.07--0.03, p < 0.05) between baseline and follow-up. The adverse reactions to macitentan were mild, with headache, anaemia and bronchitis. Other efficacy and safety outcomes did not reach statistical differences.Macitentan therapy for PH is effective and safe.

2023-11-13,37380331,Transcatheter closure of atrial septal defect in the elderly: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Despite the establishment of transcatheter closure as the treatment of choice in adults with secundum atrial septal defects (ASDs), the effectiveness of this approach in the elderly is disputed. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to explore the impact of transcatheter ASD closure in patients ≥60 years old.We systematically searched four major electronic databases (PubMed, CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), Scopus and Web of Science), ClinicalTrials.gov, article references and grey literature. Primary outcomes were the right ventricular end-diastolic diameter (RVEDD) and the New York Heart Association functional class change, whereas secondary outcomes included systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (sPAP), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), tricuspid valve regurgitation (TR) change, as well as the rate of atrial arrhythmias and all-cause mortality.In total, 18 single-arm cohorts comprising 1184 patients were included. RVEDD was reduced after ASD closure (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.9, 95% CI -1.2 to -0.7). Elderly patients had 9.5 times higher odds of being asymptomatic after ASD closure (95% CI 5.06 to 17.79). Furthermore, ASD closure improved sPAP (mean difference (MD) -10.8, 95% CI -14.6 to -7), LVEDD (SMD 0.8, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.0), TR severity (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.60) and BNP (MD -68.3, 95% CI -114.4 to -22.1). There was a neutral effect of ASD closure on atrial arrhythmias.Transcatheter ASD closure is beneficial for the elderly population since it improves functional capacity, biventricular dimensions, pulmonary pressures, TR severity and BNP. However, the incidence of atrial arrhythmias did not change significantly after the intervention.CRD42022378574.",yes,no,yes,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, biomarker",natriuretic,,6
2023-11-15,36721907,Pulmonary vasodilator therapies in pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with CHD: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"The optimal treatment strategy using pulmonary vasodilators in pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with CHD (PAH-CHD) remains controversial. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of pulmonary vasodilators in PAH-CHD. PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched through May 2022 and a network meta-analysis was conducted. The primary outcomes were mean difference of changes in 6-minute walk distance, NYHA functional class, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide. The secondary outcomes included pulmonary vascular resistance, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, and resting oxygen saturation. We identified 14 studies, yielding 807 patients with PAH-CHD. Bosentan and sildenafil were associated with a significant increase in 6-minute walk distance from baseline compared with placebo (MD 48.92 m, 95% CI 0.32 to 97.55 and MD 59.70 m, 95% CI 0.88 to 118.53, respectively). Bosentan, sildenafil, and combination of bosentan and sildenafil were associated with significant improvement in NYHA functional class compared with placebo (MD -0.33, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.14, MD -0.58, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.22 and MD -0.62, 95% CI -0.92 to -0.31, respectively). Bosentan and sildenafil were also associated with significant improvements in secondary outcomes. These findings were largely confirmed in the subgroup analysis. Various adverse events were reported; however, serious adverse event rates were relatively low (4.8-8.7%), including right heart failure, acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, hypotension, and discontinuation of pulmonary vasodilators. In conclusion, bosentan and sildenafil were the most effective in improving prognostic risk factor such as 6-minute walk distance and NYHA class. Overall, pulmonary vasodilators were well tolerated in PAH-CHD.",yes,no,yes,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",natriuretic,,6
2023-11-01,37202215,Sacubitril/valsartan ameliorates renal tubulointerstitial injury through increasing renal plasma flow in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes with aldosterone excess.,"Aldosterone has been assumed to be one of aggravating factors in diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Natriuretic peptides/guanylyl cyclase-A/cGMP signalling has been shown to ameliorate aldosterone-induced renal injury in mice. Sacubitril/valsartan (SAC/VAL) is used clinically for chronic heart failure and hypertension, in part by augmenting natriuretic peptide bioavailability. The effects of SAC/VAL on renal pathophysiology including in DKD, however, have remained unclarified.Eight-week-old male db/db mice fed on a high-salt diet (HSD) were treated with vehicle or aldosterone (0.2 μg/kg/min), and divided into four groups: HSD control, ALDO (aldosterone), ALDO + VAL (valsartan), and ALDO + SAC/VAL group. After 4 weeks, they were analysed for plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels, renal histology, and haemodynamic parameters including glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by FITC-inulin and renal plasma flow (RPF) by para-amino hippuric acid.The ALDO + SAC/VAL group showed significantly increased plasma ANP concentration and creatinine clearance, and decreased tubulointerstitial fibrosis and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin expression compared to ALDO and ALDO + VAL groups. SAC/VAL treatment increased GFR and RPF, and suppressed expression of Tgfb1, Il1b, Ccl2, and Lcn2 genes compared to the ALDO group. The percentage of tubulointerstitial fibrotic areas negatively correlated with the RPF and GFR.In a mouse model of type 2 diabetes with aldosterone excess, SAC/VAL increased RPF and GFR, and ameliorated tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Furthermore, RPF negatively correlated well with tubulointerstitial injury, suggesting that the beneficial effects of SAC/VAL could be through increased renal plasma flow with enhanced natriuretic peptide bioavailability.",yes,no,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",natriuretic,,5
2023-11-01,37795360,Risk of cardiac rupture among elderly patients with diabetes presenting with first acute myocardial infarction.,"We aimed to analyze the risk of cardiac rupture (CR) in aged diabetic patients with acute ST-segment elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI) who were followed up for one month, and analyze its independent risk factors.A total of 3063 aged patients with first onset STEMI admitted to Beijing Anzhen Hospital from January 2001 to December 2020 were retrospectively included. There were 2020 patients without diabetes mellitus (DM) and 1043 patients with DM. We used propensity scores matching (PSM) method to balance baseline exposure factors between patients with or without DM, and all were divided the DM group (1043 cases) and the non-DM group (1043 cases) after the PSM. The primary outcome was CR (the composite rate of papillary muscle rupture, ventricular septum perforation, free wall rupture), which was diagnosed based on clinical manifestations and/or echocardiographic findings. Kaplan-meier survival analyses and log-rank test was used to evaluate the risk of CR between the two groups, and Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the independent risk factors for CR.After PSM, the baseline clinical data were similar between the DM and non-DM group (all P>0.05). However, level of glycated hemoglobin was significantly higher in the DM group (P<0.05). During 1 month of follow-up, there were 55 (2.64%) cases of CR, most occurred within 48h after admission (40 cases). Among the 55 cases, 11(0.53%) had papillary muscle rupture, 18(0.86%) had ventricular septum perforation, and 26(1.25%) had free wall rupture. Kaplan-meier survival analyses detected that the DM group was associated with significantly increased risk of CR (3.36% vs. 1.92%, HR=1.532, 95% CI: 1.054-2.346, P=0.030), ventricular septum perforation (1.05% vs. 0.67%, HR=1.464, 95% CI: 1.021-2.099, P=0.038) and free wall rupture (1.63% vs. 0.86%, HR=1.861, 95% CI: 1.074-3.225, P=0.027) than those in the non-DM group. Among the 2031 aged STEMI patients without CR, 144 cases (6.90%, 144/2086) died; and among the 55 patients with CR, 37 cases (1.77%, 37/2086) died due to CR. Therefore, twenty percent (20.44%, 37/181) of death was due to CR. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that DM (HR=1.532, 95%CI: 1.054-2.346), age (HR=1.390, 95%CI: 1.079-1.791), female (HR=1.183, 95%CI: 1.049-1.334), troponin I (HR=1.364, 95%CI: 1.108-1.679), brain natriuretic peptide (HR=1.512, 95%CI: 1.069-2.139), revascularization (HR=0.827, 95%CI: 0.731-0.936) and β-receptor blocker (HR=0.849, 95%CI: 0.760-0.948) were independent risk factors of CR (all P<0.05).DM as well as a few other factors, are independent determinants of CR. CR is not a rare event among the aged STEMI patients and twenty percent of deaths are due to CR.

2023-11-01,37803294,Network meta-analysis on efficacy and safety of different biologics for ulcerative colitis.,"Therapeutic options for ulcerative colitis (UC) have increased since the introduction of biologics a few decades ago. Due to the wide range of biologics available, physicians have difficulty in selecting biologics and do not know how to balance the best drug between clinical efficacy and safety. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of biologics in treating ulcerative colitis.In this study, eight electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, Embase, Sinomed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chongqing VIP Information, and WanFang Data) were searched to collect eligible studies without language restrictions. Retrieved 1 June 2023, from inception. All articles included in the mesh analysis are randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The inclusion of drugs for each outcome was ranked using a curved surface under cumulative ranking (SUCRA). Higher SUCRA scores were associated with better outcomes, whereas lower SUCRA scores were associated with better safety. This study has registered with PROSPERO, CRD42023389483.Induction Therapy: Among the biologic therapies evaluated for induction therapy, vedolizumab demonstrated the highest efficacy in achieving clinical remission (OR vs daclizumab, 9.09; 95% CI, 1.01-81.61; SUCRA 94.1) and clinical response. Guselkumab showed the lowest risk of recurrence of UC (SUCRA 94.9%), adverse events resulting in treatment discontinuation (SUCRA 94.8%), and serious infections (SUCRA 78.0%). Maintenance Therapy: For maintenance therapy, vedolizumab ranked highest in maintaining clinical remission (OR vs mesalazine 4.36; 95% CI, 1.65-11.49; SUCRA 89.7) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA 92.6). Infliximab demonstrated the highest efficacy in endoscopic improvement (SUCRA 92.6%). Ustekinumab had the lowest risk of infections (SUCRA 92.9%), serious adverse events (SUCRA 91.3%), and serious infections (SUCRA 67.6%).Our network meta-analysis suggests that vedolizumab is the most effective biologic therapy for inducing and maintaining clinical remission in UC patients. Guselkumab shows promise in reducing the risk of recurrence and adverse events during induction therapy. Infliximab is effective in improving endoscopic outcomes during maintenance therapy. Ustekinumab appears to have a favorable safety profile. These findings provide valuable insights for clinicians in selecting the most appropriate biologic therapy for UC patients.",no,yes,yes,human RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,ulcerative colitis,5
2023-11-01,37807319,The effects of prophylactic intravenous injection of rhBNP on prognosis in patients with STEMI undergoing PPCI.,"This experiment was carried out to observe the application value of recombinant human brain natriuretic peptide (rhBNP) in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI), to provide reference for the future treatment of STEMI. In this study, we selected STEMI patients who underwent PPCI treatment in our hospital from October 2019 to December 2021 were selected as the study subjects, of which 46 received intravenous injections of rhBNP (research group), and 36 STEMI patients underwent PPCI (control group). There was no difference in clinical efficacy between the two groups (P>0.05). After treatment, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and plasma N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) levels decreased in both groups, with the research group lower than the control group; cardiac output (CO), cardiac index (CI) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) of the research group were lower than the control group's (P<0.05). The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in the research group was higher than that in the control group at 1 week and 1 month after treatment, while left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) and left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD) were lower than those in the control group (P<0.05). There was also no difference in the rate of prognostic risk events between the two groups at 6 months of follow-up (P>0.05). Combining the results of these experiments above, we believe that the intravenous injection of rhBNP in STEMI patients undergoing PPCI treatment can improve cardiac function and promote the recovery of hemodynamics.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, biomarker",natriuretic,,5
2023-11-01,37809105,Cardiovascular impairment in Shiga-toxin-2-induced experimental hemolytic-uremic syndrome: a pilot study.,"Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) can occur as a systemic complication of infection with Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). Most well-known aspects of the pathophysiology are secondary to microthrombotic kidney disease including hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. However, extrarenal manifestations, such as cardiac impairment, have also been reported. We have investigated whether these cardiac abnormalities can be reproduced in a murine animal model, in which administration of Stx, the main virulence factor of STEC, is used to induce HUS.Mice received either one high or multiple low doses of Stx to simulate the (clinically well-known) different disease courses. Cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography and analyses of biomarkers in the plasma (troponin I and brain natriuretic peptide).All Stx-challenged mice showed reduced cardiac output and depletion of intravascular volume indicated by a reduced end-diastolic volume and a higher hematocrit. Some mice exhibited myocardial injury (measured as increases in cTNI levels). A subset of mice challenged with either dosage regimen showed hyperkalemia with typical electrocardiographic abnormalities.Myocardial injury, intravascular volume depletion, reduced cardiac output, and arrhythmias as a consequence of hyperkalemia may be prognosis-relevant disease manifestations of HUS, the significance of which should be further investigated in future preclinical and clinical studies.",yes,no,no,animal,"biomarker, effectiveness",natriuretic,,5
2023-11-01,37817272,Endothelin mediates sex-differences in acclimation to high salt diet in rats.,"Current understanding of sodium (Na+) handling is based on studies done primarily in males. Contrary to the gradual increase in high salt (HS) induced natriuresis over 3-5 days in males, female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats have a robust natriuresis after 1 day of HS. Renal endothelin-1 (ET-1) signaling, through ET receptor A and B, is an important natriuretic pathway and was implicated in our previous dietary salt acclimation studies, however, the contribution of ET receptors to sex-differences in acclimation to dietary Na+ challenges has yet to be clarified. We hypothesized that ET receptors mediate the augmented natriuretic capacity of female rats in response to a HS diet.To test our hypothesis, male and female SD rats were implanted with telemeters and randomly assigned to treatment with A-182086, a dual ETA and ETB receptor antagonist, or control. 24-h urine samples were collected and assessed for electrolytes and ET-1. Studies were performed on a normal salt (NS, 0.3% NaCl) diet and after challenging rats with HS (4% NaCl) diet for 1 day.We found that A-182086 increased blood pressure in male and female SD rats fed either diet. Importantly, A-182086 eliminated sex-differences in natriuresis on NS and HS. In particular, A-182086 promotes HS-induced natriuresis in male rats rather than attenuating the natriuretic capacity of females. Further, the sex-difference in urinary ET-1 excretion in NS-fed rats was eliminated by A-182086.In conclusion, ET receptors are crucial for mediating sex-difference in the natriuretic capacity primarily through their actions in male rats.",yes,no,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety",natriuretic,,5
2023-11-01,37829481,Real-world effectiveness of ustekinumab for patients with ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Ustekinumab has recently been approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) based on data from clinical trials. However, the effectiveness of ustekinumab in patients with UC in a real-world setting remains unclear. Hence, in this meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of ustekinumab in a real-world setting and to investigate the predictors of its effectiveness. A comprehensive literature search was performed to examine the effectiveness of ustekinumab in UC patients admitted between January 2019 and December 2021. Data on clinical remission, response, and corticosteroid-free clinical remission rates were extracted, pooled, and analyzed. Meta-regression analysis was performed to investigate the source of heterogeneity and the impact of moderators on the outcomes of interest. A total of 14 eligible studies were identified. The pooled clinical remission rate was 55.0% at week 8, 36.1% at week 16, 46.6% at month 6, and 38.6% at month 12. The meta-regression analysis showed that prior use of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents and vedolizumab and the publication style were significant moderators. Additionally, out of 258 patients, there were 28 adverse events (AEs) (10.9%). The effectiveness of ustekinumab in real-world patients with UC was consistent with the results clinical trials. Moreover, previous treatment with anti-TNF agents and vedolizumab might have affected the effectiveness of ustekinumab.",no,yes,yes,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,ulcerative colitis,5
2023-11-01,37834109,Anhydrous Alum Inhibits α-MSH-Induced Melanogenesis by Down-Regulating MITF via Dual Modulation of CREB and ERK.,"Melanogenesis, the intricate process of melanin synthesis, is central to skin pigmentation and photoprotection and is regulated by various signaling pathways and transcription factors. To develop potential skin-whitening agents, we used B16F1 melanoma cells to investigate the inhibitory effects of anhydrous alum on melanogenesis and its underlying molecular mechanisms. Anhydrous alum (KAl(SO4)2) with high purity (>99%), which is generated through the heat-treatment of hydrated alum (KAl(SO4)2·12H2O) at 400 °C, potentiates a significant reduction in melanin content without cytotoxicity. Anhydrous alum downregulates the master regulator of melanogenesis, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), which targets key genes involved in melanogenesis, thereby inhibiting α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH)-induced melanogenesis. Phosphorylation of the cAMP response element-binding protein, which acts as a co-activator of MITF gene expression, is attenuated by anhydrous alum, resulting in compromised MITF transcription. Notably, anhydrous alum promoted extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation, leading to the impaired nuclear localization of MITF. Overall, these results demonstrated the generation and mode of action of anhydrous alum in B16F1 cells, which constitutes a promising option for cosmetic or therapeutic use.",yes,no,no,in vitro,effectiveness,melanocortin,,5
2023-11-01,37836478,Dietary Interventions in Ulcerative Colitis: A Systematic Review of the Evidence with Meta-Analysis.,"(1) Background: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic colon inflammation caused by genetic and environmental factors, including diet. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess the impact of diet on UC management in children and adults (2) Methods: A comprehensive search across databases yielded relevant studies, and risk of bias in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. This study was conducted in conformity to the 2020 PRISMA guidelines. The certainty of evidence for outcomes was evaluated using GRADE methodology. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager software version 5.4. (3) Results: Fourteen RCTs were included, results indicated higher clinical response, remission, and endoscopic remission rates in diet-treated groups. Carrageenan-free, anti-inflammatory, and cow milk protein elimination diets showed no significant advantages in maintaining clinical remission. However, a study involving fermented cow milk with bifidobacterial demonstrated favorable outcomes. Overall, pooled analysis leaned in favor of dietary intervention for sustaining clinical remission; (4) Conclusions: The relationship between diet and UC is an evolving terrain that demands deeper exploration. This systematic review and meta-analysis highlight the evolving relationship between diet and UC, necessitating further exploration. While understanding grows, adopting personalized dietary approaches could alleviate symptoms, and support a more positive disease trajectory.",no,yes,yes,human RCT,effectiveness,,ulcerative colitis,5

Risk factors included demographic and disease-related risk factors. Odds ratios (ORs) and weighted mean differences (WMDs) were used as the effect sizes, and shown with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Sensitivity analysis was conducted. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022378652).Twenty-two studies of 13,875 subjects were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Increased age was associated with a higher risk of postoperative PVR (pooled WMD = 3.98, 95%CI: 0.21, 7.75, P = 0.038). Smokers had a higher risk of postoperative PVR than non-smokers (pooled OR = 5.07, 95%CI: 2.21-11.61, P<0.001). Presence of preoperative PVR was associated with a greater risk of postoperative PVR (pooled OR = 22.28, 95%CI: 2.54, 195.31, P = 0.005). Presence of vitreous hemorrhage was associated with a greater risk of postoperative PVR (pooled OR = 4.12, 95%CI: 1.62, 10.50, P = 0.003). Individuals with aphakia or pseudophakia had an increased risk of postoperative PVR in contrast to those without (pooled OR = 1.41, 95%CI: 1.02, 1.95, P = 0.040). The risk of postoperative PVR was higher among patients with macula off versus those with macula on (pooled OR = 1.85, 95%CI: 1.24, 2.74, P = 0.002). Extent of RD in patients with postoperative PVR was larger than that in patients without (pooled WMD = 0.31, 95%CI: 0.02, 0.59, P = 0.036). Patients with postoperative PVR had longer duration of RD symptoms than those without (pooled WMD = 10.36, 95%CI: 2.29, 18.43, P = 0.012).Age, smoking, preoperative PVR, vitreous hemorrhage, aphakia or pseudophakia, macula off, extent of RD, and duration of RD symptoms were risk factors for postoperative PVR in patients undergoing RD surgery, which may help better identify high-risk patients, and provide timely interventions.",no,yes,yes,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinopathy,5
2023-11-01,37904440,"Comparative of the effectiveness and safety of biological agents, small molecule drugs, and microbiome therapies in ulcerative colitis: Systematic review and network meta-analysis.","Biological agents are commonly used for the first-line treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). However, small-molecule drugs and microbiome therapies are now being used as new treatments for ulcerative colitis. We aimed to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics, small-molecule drugs, and microbiome therapies for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.We searched the Cochrane, Embase, and PubMed databases from their inception to December 2022. RCTs that recruited patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis treated with biological agents, small-molecule drugs, and microbiome therapies. Efficacy outcomes were induction of clinical remission and mucosal healing; safety outcomes were adverse events and serious adverse events. A network meta-analysis with multivariate consistency model random-effect meta-regression was done, with rankings based on surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) values. Higher SUCRA scores correlate with better efficacy, whereas lower SUCRA scores correlate with better safety.A total of 31 RCTs comprising 7933 UC patients were included in our studies. A risk of bias assessment showed a low risk of bias for most of the included studies. Upadacitinib ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (SUCRA, 0.83) and mucosal healing (SUCRA, 0.44). Moreover, no treatments were found to increase the occurrence of adverse events compared with placebos. Ustekinumab ranked lowest for adverse events (SUCRA 0.26) and probiotic ranked lowest for serious adverse events (0·21), whereas tofacitinib ranked highest for adverse events (0·43) and upadacitinib ranked highest for serious adverse events (0·43).In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we found upadacitinib to be ranked highest for the induction of clinical remission and mucosal healing, but the worst performing agent in terms of adverse events in UC patients. Probiotics were the best-performing agent for safety outcomes.

2023-11-01,37904474,Long-term effects of angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor therapy in heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction: A retrospective cohort study.,"Heart failure is an increasing public health issue with substantial morbidity and mortality rates. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and long-term outcomes of angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNi) in the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) 5 years after treatment initiation. This retrospective study analyzed a cohort of 75 patients diagnosed with HFrEF over a period of 5 years after the initiation of ARNi therapy. The initial clinical condition, laboratory and echocardiographic measurements including left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), New York Heart Association functional classes (NYHA-FC) and the prognostic nutritional index were compared to the corresponding values obtained after a 5-year period of ARNi therapy. In addition, the number of annual hospitalizations, mortality rates and any history of adverse effects during the follow-up period were recorded. The N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level, LVEF, and NYHA-FC values demonstrated significant improvement at the end of the 5-year follow-up period (all parameters, P < .001). Although the observed increase in the prognostic nutritional index was not statistically significant (P = .077), it is worth noting. A significant reduction in daily diuretic doses and hospitalizations due to heart failure was observed following the use of ARNi (all comparisons, P < .001). The prevalence of hypotension was around 16% (being symptomatic in 4%), making it the most frequently observed adverse event. The 5-year cardiovascular mortality rate was 17.3%. The use of ARNi in HFrEF patients was associated with a notable improvement in NYHA-FC, LVEF, and NT-proBNP levels in the long-term, while also leading to a better nutritional status and reduced need for diuretics and annual hospitalization. Additionally, ARNi usage has been associated with improved nutritional status, decreased reliance on diuretics, and reduced frequency of annual hospitalizations. These effects were associated with a lack of significant increase in adverse effects. These results may contribute to a better understanding of ARNi's long-term effects on patient outcomes.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",natriuretic,,5
2023-11-01,37904677,Inflammatory bowel disease and the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage: A Mendelian randomization study and meta-analysis.,"The link between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is still unclear.We conducted a Mendelian randomization research and meta-analysis to explore the impact of IBD and its subtypes (Crohn's disease [CD], ulcerative colitis [UC]) on the risk of ICH.Two large genome-wide association analysis studies of International Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium (IIBDGC) and International Stroke Genetics Consortium as exposure (IBD, UC, and CD) and outcome (ICH) in the initial stage. IBD, CD, UC GWAS data from the FinnGen consortium were adopted for the replication phase, and ultimately, the results of the initial stage and replication phase data were combined in a meta-analysis to evaluate the causal association between IBD and its subtypes and the risk of ICH.In the initial stage, we found that in the IVW (odds ratio [OR] = 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71-0.96, p = .01), MR-PRESSO (OR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.75-0.97, p = .02) and MR.RAPS (OR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.76-0.98, p = .02) method showed that UC is associated with the risk of ICH. The causal relationship between IBD, CD, and the risk of ICH cannot be found by the IVW method. IBD and its subtypes UC, CD, and risk of ICH cannot find the presence of heterogeneity and pleiotropy. In replication stage, IBD (OR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.59-0.94, p = .0135) related to ICH, while the IVW approach did not establish a causal link in UC and CD. The meta-analysis still indicated that UC (OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.72-0.93, p < .05) would lessen the risk of ICH while the causality between IBD, CD, and ICH was unable to be established.UC was causally related to ICH, but IBD and CD are not associated with ICH.

Berlin Heart EXCOR is currently 1 of the few VADs specific for children.This retrospective study includes pediatric patients who underwent Berlin Heart EXCOR placement in a Brazilian hospital between 2012 and 2021. Clinical and laboratory data at the time of VAD implantation and the occurrence of complications and outcomes (success as a bridge to transplant or death) were analyzed.Eight patients, from 8 months to 15 years, were included: 6 with cardiomyopathy and 2 with congenital heart disease. Six were on Intermacs 1 and 2 on Intermacs 2. The most common complications observed were stroke and right ventricular dysfunction. Six were transplanted, and 2 died. Those submitted to transplant had a higher mean weight than those who died, with no statistically significant difference. The underlying disease had no impact on the outcome. The group undergoing transplant had lower brain natriuretic peptide and lactate values, but no laboratory variable showed a statistically significant difference in the outcome.A VAD is an invasive treatment with potentially serious adverse effects and is still poorly available in Brazil. However, as a bridge to transplant, it is a useful treatment for children in progressive clinical decline.

Recent research suggests that GLP-1 RAs may influence diabetic retinopathy (DR). We searched ClinicalTrials.gov for trials comparing FDA-approved GLP-1 RAs to placebo, insulin, or oral antidiabetic medicine. Rates of DR, ocular adverse events, demographics, and clinical characteristics were compared amongst cohorts on 93 trials. GLP-1 RA use was significantly associated with increased risk of early-stage DR (risk ratio (RR) = 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.01, 1.68]) and early-stage retinal adverse events (RR = 1.29, 95% CI [1.01, 1.66]) compared to placebo. Compared to insulin, GLP-1 RA use protected against late-stage DR (RR = 0.38, 95% CI [0.15, 0.98]). Analysis of individual GLP-1 RAs showed that albiglutide is responsible for these trends, as it is significantly associated with a higher risk of early-stage DR (RR = 2.18, 95% CI [1.01, 4.67]) compared to placebo and a lower risk of late-stage DR (RR = 0.25, 95% CI [0.09, 0.70]) compared to insulin. Albiglutide similarly affected retinal and ocular adverse events. Demographic analysis revealed significant differences between GLP-1 RA and comparator groups for age, HbA1c, body weight, BMI, duration of diabetes, sex, race, and ethnicity.

2023-11-02,37787346,Efficacy of early biologic therapy versus late/conventional therapy in children and adolescents with Crohn's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The objective of this study was to estimate the effectiveness of early biologics compared to conventional treatment in the management of Crohn's disease among pediatric and adolescent patients.A comprehensive literature search was conducted in four electronic databases to identify relevant studies published from inception to 2023. The inclusion criteria comprised randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies that reported on the efficacy and clinical outcomes of early biologic therapy compared to late/conventional therapy in children with Crohn's disease. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and the Newcastle Ottawa scale.A total of 13 studies (2 RCTs and 11 cohort studies), involving 861 patients, were included in the meta-analysis. The results demonstrated that early biologic therapy was associated with a significantly higher rate of clinical remission (risk ratio [RR] 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10-1.54), lower relapse rates (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.21-0.53), and improved mucosal healing (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.10-1.97) compared to late/conventional therapy. However, it should be noted that there was evidence of publication bias among studies reporting clinical remission.In conclusion, early biologic therapy is significantly more effective in achieving clinical remission (within two years of diagnosis), promoting mucosal healing, and reducing relapse rates in pediatric and adolescent patients with Crohn's disease, compared to late/conventional therapy. These findings emphasize the importance of initiating biological therapy early in the treatment of Crohn's disease in this patient population.",no,yes,yes,human non-RCT,effectiveness,,crohn's disease,5

One session of moxibustion took 20 min, once daily, for 14 days in total. Before and after intervention, the body mass and fecal moisture content were compared in the rats of each group; using abdominal wall withdrawal reflex, the visceral hypersensitivity was evaluated; with elevated plus maze (EPM) and light-dark box (LDB), the anxiety conditions were assessed. After intervention, HRV was compared among groups, the ultrastructure of intestinal mucosa was observed under the transmission electron microscope in the rats of each group, and ANP expression in the myocardial tissue was detected using Western blot method and immunofluorescence.Before the intervention, compared with the blank group, the body mass and visceral pain threshold of rats were reduced in the model group, the convention group and the biaoben group (P<0.05), fecal moisture content and AWR scores (at the dilatation pressure of 40, 60 and 80 mm Hg, 1 mm Hg ≈ 0.133 kPa) were elevated (P<0.05); and time in the open arm, the open arm entry number and the total movement distance (EPM), the time spent in the light compartment, the number of dark to light transitions and the total transition distance (LDB) were decreased (P<0.05). After the intervention, compared with the blank group, in the model group, the body mass, visceral pain threshold, standard diviation of NN intervals (SDNN) and root mean square of successive RR interval differences (RMSSD) were dropped (P<0.05), fecal moisture content, AWR scores (the dilation pressures of 40, 60 and 80 mm Hg), LF/HF and ANP expression were increased (P<0.05), the time in open arm, the open arm entry number and the total movement distance (EPM), the time spent in the light compartment, the number of dark to light transitions and the total transition distance (LDB) were decreased (P<0.05).

Anthracyclines, despite improving patient survival, have serious cardiotoxicity and therefore cardiac monitoring should be a priority. The purpose of this study is to explore the possible early predictors of anthracycline-induced subclinical cardiotoxicity(AISC)in acute leukemia patients.We conducted a prospective observational study involving 51 patients with acute leukemia treated with anthracycline. Demographic data, clinical variables, echocardiography variables and biochemical variables were collected at baseline and after 3 cycles of chemotherapy. Patients were divided into the AISC and No-AISC groups according to changes of global longitudinal peak systolic strain. Regression models and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were used to explore the relationship between the variables and AISC.17 of the patients suffered subclinical cardiotoxicity after 3 cycles of anthracycline treatment. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed a significant association of DBil (OR 0.612, 95% CI 0.409-0.916, p = 0.017), TBil (OR 0.841, 95% CI 0.717-0.986, p = 0.033), PLT (OR 1.012, 95% CI 1.002-1.021, p = 0.016) and Glu (OR 1.873, 95% CI 1.009-3.475, p = 0.047) with the development of AISC. After 3 cycles of chemotherapy, there was a significant difference in PLT between the AISC and NO-AISC groups. Moreover, the dynamic changes in PLT from baseline to after 3 cycles of chemotherapy were each statistically significant in the AISC and NO-AISC groups. The combination of PLT and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) had the highest area under curves (AUC) for the diagnosis of AISC than PLT and NT-proBNP alone (AUC = 0.713, 95%CI: 0.56-0.87, P = 0.017).Total bilirubin (TBil), direct bilirubin (DBil), platelets (PLT) and blood glucose (Glu) are independent influencing factors for AISC in acute leukemia patients receiving anthracycline therapy.

In consideration of emerging evidence that there are clinically relevant sex-related differences in the course of T2DM and subsequent cardiovascular outcomes, it is unknown if SGLT2i therapy is sex-independently utilized in daily clinical practice. Methods: Patients with T2DM and HF admitted to a tertiary academic center between January 2014 and April 2020 were identified through a search of electronic health records. Data on antidiabetic therapy were acquired at discharge and were screened for SGLT2i prescription. Results: Overall, 812 patients (median age 70 years, 29.7% female) were included in the present analysis. Only 17.3% of the study population received an SGLT2i. In comparison between sexes, females show lower rates of SGLT2i prescription (11.2% vs. 19.8%, p = 0.003), despite comparable patient characteristics. Furthermore, male HF patients showed a significantly higher probability of SGLT2i prescription with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.59 (95% confidence interval 1.29-5.19; p = 0.008). Females who did not receive an SGLT2i showed higher rates of chronic kidney disease (25.2% vs. 7.4%, p = 0.039) and greater levels of N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP; 2092 vs. 825 pg/mL, p = 0.011) as compared to female SGLT2i recipients, which did not explain the observed sex-related disparities. Conclusion: SGLT2i are potentially underutilized in female patients with HF and T2DM, despite an overall increasing prescription trend during the observation period. Reasons for withholding therapy could not be objectified. The present data indicate a major need to increase awareness of guideline-directed therapy, especially in female HF patients.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",natriuretic,,5

They were randomly and retrospectively divided into a control group (40 cases) and an observation group (40 cases), and treated with clopidogrel and ticagrelor, respectively. The clinical effects were compared.The starting perfusion time of the contrast agent in the myocardial infarction area in the observation group was 2.22±0.27 s, and the peak perfusion time was 2.62±0.27 s, which was lower than those in the control group (2.51±0.29 s and 3.21±0.39 s, t=4.629, 7.867, p=0.000). The ratio of peak perfusion intensity between the two groups was significantly different (t=2.363, p=0.021). Left ventricular ejection fraction, stroke volume index, and cardiac index in the observation group were higher than those in the control group (55.03±6.03 vs. 52.33±5.13; 57.39±6.81 vs. 51.11±6.31 L/min·m-2; 3.49±0.45 vs. 3.12±0.38 mL/m2, t=2.157, 4.278, 3.973, p<0.05). The observation group had lower levels of brain natriuretic peptide and C-reactive protein compared to the control group (425.35±55.71 vs. 589.36±70.24 pg/mL; 15.13±1.03 vs. 21.64±2.74 mg/L; t=11.570, 14.066, p=0.000). There was no statistical significance in the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events between the two groups (2.50% vs. 7.50%, χ2=1.920, p=0.166).The use of ticagrelor can regulate myocardial microcirculation and improve cardiac function in STEMI patients undergoing PCI.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",natriuretic,,5
2023-11-03,37917004,GRP78 acts as a cAMP/PKA signaling modulator through the MC4R pathway in porcine embryonic development.,"Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) binds to and stabilizes melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R), which activates protein kinase A (PKA) by regulating G proteins. GRP78 is primarily used as a marker for endoplasmic reticulum stress; however, its other functions have not been well studied. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the function of GRP78 during porcine embryonic development. The developmental quality of porcine embryos, expression of cell cycle proteins, and function of mitochondria were evaluated by inhibiting the function of GRP78. Porcine oocytes were activated to undergo parthenogenesis, and blastocysts were obtained after 7 days of in vitro culture. GRP78 function was inhibited by adding 20 μM HA15 to the in vitro culture medium. The inhibition in GRP78 function led to a decrease in G proteins release, which subsequently downregulated the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/PKA pathway. Ultimately, inhibition of GRP78 function induced the inhibition of CDK1 and cyclin B expression and disruption of the cell cycle. In addition, inhibition of GRP78 function regulated DRP1 and SIRT1 expression, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction. This study provides new insights into the role of GRP78 in porcine embryonic development, particularly its involvement in the regulation of the MC4R pathway and downstream cAMP/PKA signaling. The results suggest that the inhibition of GRP78 function in porcine embryos by HA15 treatment may have negative effects on embryo quality and development. This study also demonstrated that GRP78 plays a crucial role in the functioning of MC4R, which releases the G protein during porcine embryonic development.",yes,no,no,in vitro,"effectiveness, biomarker",melanocortin,,5
2023-11-04,36860164,Tofacitinib for Acute Severe Ulcerative Colitis: A Systematic Review.,"Tofacitinib has emerged as a new potential treatment for acute severe ulcerative colitis [ASUC]. We conducted a systematic review to assess efficacy, safety and integration in ASUC algorithms.Systematic searching was done in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Clinicaltrials.gov until August 17, 2022, including all studies reporting original observations on tofacitinib for ASUC, preferably defined according to Truelove and Witts criteria. The primary outcome was colectomy-free survival.Of 1072 publications identified, 21 studies were included of which three were ongoing clinical trials. The remaining comprised a pooled cohort originating from 15 case publications [n = 42], a GETAID cohort study [n = 55], a case-control study [n = 40 cases] and a paediatric cohort [n = 11]. Of these 148 reported cases, tofacitinib was used as second-line treatment after steroid failure in previous infliximab failures or third-line after sequential steroid and infliximab or cyclosporine failure, 69 [47%] were female, median age range was 17-34 years and disease duration was 0.7-10 years. Overall, 30-day colectomy-free survival was 85% [n = 123 of 145; n = 3 without colectomy had follow-up <30 days], 90-day 86% [n = 113 of 132; n = 16 follow-up <90 days] and 180-day 69% [n = 77 of 112; n = 36 follow-up <180 days]. Tofacitinib persistence at follow-up was 68-91%, clinical remission 35-69% and endoscopic remission 55%. Adverse events occurred in 22 patients, predominantly being infectious complications other than herpes zoster [n = 13], and resulted in tofacitinib discontinuation in seven patients.Tofacitinib appears promising for treatment of ASUC with high short-term colectomy-free survival among refractory patients who are otherwise deemed to require colectomy.

2023-11-06,37257583,Expert perspectives on strategic factors for the management and prevention of heart failure in Portugal.,"Heart failure (HF) has significant morbidity and mortality, and its prevalence will continue to increase in the future. This unfavorable evolution requires reflection as well as recommendations and decisions based on expert critical and strategic appraisal.In the Acceleration on Heart Failure Empowerment and Awareness - the Portuguese Challenge (ATHENA-PT) study, a range of strategic factors that represent the strengths, weaknesses, threats, and opportunities (SWOT) of HF in Portugal were established. These factors were assessed quantitatively by experts, to create a final SWOT matrix for the management and prevention of HF in Portugal and to outline recommendations.For HF management, the panel emphasized the following strategic recommendations: (i) reimbursement of natriuretic peptides testing in primary healthcare; (ii) reimbursement of Doppler assessment in echocardiographic studies and promotion of detailed information in reports; (iii) intervention to improve the prognosis of patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction; (iv) ensuring effective healthcare transition between hospital and ambulatory units, using checklists/protocols; and (v) reinforcement and commitment to the training of primary health physicians and to the cardiac rehabilitation of patients. For the prevention of HF, the following recommendations/proposals were proposed: (i) campaigns to raise awareness of cardiovascular disease risk factors; (ii) promotion of physical exercise and healthy eating; and (iii) avoidance of therapeutic inertia in the management of risk factors.The acknowledgment of various strategic factors and their prioritization by experts made it possible to create and reinforce a range of new strategic recommendations for the management and prevention of HF.",yes,no,no,other,effectiveness,natriuretic,,5
2023-11-06,37466026,Gender-Related Differences in Patients with Acute Heart Failure: Observation from the Journey Heart Failure-Turkish Population Study.,"Gender-related clinical variations in patients with acute heart failure have been described in previous studies. However, there is still a lack of research on gender differences in patients hospitalized for acute heart failure in Türkiye. The aim of this study is to compare the clinical features, in-hospital approaches, and outcomes of male and female patients hospitalized for acute heart failure.Differences in clinical characteristics, medication prescription, hospital management, and outcomes between males and females with acute heart failure were investigated from the Journey Heart Failure-Turkish Population study.Nine hundred eighteen patients (57.2%) were men and 688 (42.8%) were women. Women were older than men (70.48 ± 13.20 years vs. 65.87 ± 12.82 years; P <.001). The frequency of comorbidities such as hypertension (72.7% vs. 62.4%, P <.001), diabetes (46.5% vs. 38.5%, P = .001),  atrial  fibrillation  (46.5%  vs.  33.4%,  P <.001), New York Heart Association class III-IV symptoms (80.6% vs. 71.2%, P =.001), and dyspnea in the rest (73.8% vs. 68.3%, P =.044) were more common in women on admission. Male patients were more frequently hospitalized with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (51.0% vs. 72.4%, P <.001). In-hospital mortality was higher among female patients (9.3% vs. 6.4%, P =.022). Higher  New  York  Heart  Association  class,  lower  estimated  glomerular  filtration  rate, higher N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide on admission, and mechanical ventilation usage were the independent parameters of in-hospital mortality, whereas the female gender was not.Our study clearly demonstrated the diversity in presentation, management, and in-hospital outcomes of acute heart failure between male and female patients. Although left ventricular systolic functions were better in female patients, in-hospital mortality was higher. Recognizing these differences in the management of heart failure in different sexes will serve better results in clinical practice.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",natriuretic,,5

However, systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials on this critical topic are scant.To evaluate acute kidney injury risk associated with intravitreal anti-VEGF drugs in patients with retinal diseases.We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials on 12 July, 2023, and included randomized controlled trials reporting acute kidney injury between anti-VEGF drugs (e.g., aflibercept, bevacizumab, brolucizumab, and ranibizumab) and controls for retinal diseases (e.g., age-related macular degeneration, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, diabetic retinopathy/diabetic macular edema, retinal vein occlusion, and myopic choroidal neovascularization). Data were synthesized by a fixed-effects model for pooling odds ratios (ORs) using the Peto method.We included 13 randomized controlled trials (four and nine trials for aflibercept and ranibizumab, respectively) with a total of 4282 participants. The meta-analysis indicated intravitreal anti-VEGF drugs did not increase the acute kidney injury risk, compared with controls (odds ratio [OR]: 1.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49-2.04, I2: 0%), and no differences in the acute kidney injury risk were observed between different anti-VEGF drugs (OR: 1.10, 95% CI 0.27-4.43, I2: 0% for aflibercept; OR: 0.97, 95% CI 0.42-2.22, I2: 0% for ranibizumab) and between different retinal diseases (OR: 4.61, 95% CI 0.07-284.13, I2: not applicable for age-related macular degeneration; OR: 0.90, 95% CI 0.42-1.93, I2: 0% for diabetic retinopathy/diabetic macular edema; OR: 1.57, 95% CI 0.16-15.88, I2: 0% for retinal vein occlusion).Intravitreal anti-VEGF drugs were not associated with an acute kidney injury risk, regardless of which anti-VEGF drugs (aflibercept or ranibizumab) or retinal diseases (age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy/diabetic macular edema, or retinal vein occlusion) were involved.PROSPERO CRD42021267854.",no,yes,yes,human RCT,safety,,"retinopathy, retinal disease",5
2023-11-06,37742539,Association Between Catheter Ablation for Nonparoxysmal Atrial Fibrillation and Functional Mitral Regurgitation in Patients With Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction.,"Functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) often coexists with atrial fibrillation (AF) and may have a causal relation with AF persistence and exacerbation of heart failure (HF). The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of FMR on AF catheter ablation (AFCA) outcomes and improvement in FMR after AFCA in patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and nonparoxysmal AF. Excluding patients with primary valve disease or post-mitral valve repair, 280 patients with HFpEF who underwent CA for nonparoxysmal AF were retrospectively included. All patients completed 1-year follow-up and were assessed for FMR, AF recurrence and HF parameters, including echocardiography. At baseline, FMR was present in 153 (54.6%) patients (mild, n = 112; moderate, n = 40; severe, n = 1), and these were decreased to 70 (25%) significantly 1 year after AFCA (mild, n = 64; moderate, n = 6), 119 patients (78%) had improvement in MR (a decrease of ≥1 level in the severity from baseline to 1 year on echocardiography). Overall, 274 patients (97.9%) had sinus rhythm at the 1-year examination, and recurrent AF-free survival did not differ in patients with and without MR improvement (83.2% vs 82.4%, p = 0.908). However, the MR improvement group had a significantly lower cardiothoracic ratio, left atrial diameter, E/e', and B-type natriuretic peptide levels after 1 year than those in the MR nonimprovement group. In conclusion, the majority of the HFpEF patients with nonparoxysmal AF had improvement of FMR after AFCA with the high maintenance of sinus rhythm, leading to a virtuous cycle of cardiac function.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, biomarker",natriuretic,,5
2023-11-06,37752084,CEBPD REGULATES OXIDATIVE STRESS AND INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES IN HYPERTENSIVE CARDIAC REMODELING.,"Hypertension seems to inevitably cause cardiac remodeling, increasing the mortality of patients. This study aimed to explore the molecular mechanism of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein delta (CEBPD)-mediated oxidative stress and inflammation in hypertensive cardiac remodeling. The hypertensive murine model was established through angiotensin-II injection, and hypertensive mice underwent overexpressed CEBPD vector injection, cardiac function evaluation, and observation of histological changes. The cell model was established by angiotensin-II treatment and transfected with overexpressed CEBPD vector. Cell viability and surface area and oxidative stress (reactive oxygen species/superoxide dismutase/lactate dehydrogenase/malondialdehyde) were assessed, and inflammatory factors (TNF-α/IL-1β/IL-6/IL-10) were determined both in vivo and in vitro . The levels of CEBPD, miR-96-5p, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor 1 (IP3R), natriuretic peptide B, and natriuretic peptide A, collagen I, and collagen III in tissues and cells were determined. The binding relationships of CEBPD/miR-96-5p/IP3R 3' untranslated region were validated. CEBPD was reduced in cardiac tissue of hypertensive mice, and CEBPD upregulation improved cardiac function and attenuated fibrosis and hypertrophy, along with reductions of reactive oxygen species/lactate dehydrogenase/malondialdehyde/TNF-α/IL-1β/IL-6 and increases in superoxide dismutase/IL-10. CEBPD enriched on the miR-96-5p promoter to promote miR-96-5p expression, whereas CEBPD and miR-96-5p negatively regulated IP3R. miR-96-5p silencing/IP3R overexpression reversed the alleviative role of CEBPD overexpression in hypertensive mice. In summary, CEBPD promoted miR-96-5p to negatively regulate IP3R expression to inhibit oxidative stress and inflammation, thereby alleviating hypertensive cardiac remodeling.",yes,no,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",natriuretic,,5
2023-11-06,37863422,The effects of neuropeptide W on food consumption and feeding behavior in neonatal meat-type chicks: Role of CRF1/CRF2 and NPY1 receptors.,"In several studies, the regulatory role of the neuropeptide W (NPW) system in food intake has been demonstrated. Considering the lack of avian studies in this field, the current research was conducted to evaluate the effects of intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of NPW and its interferences with corticotropin, melanocortin, and neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptors on meal consumption and feeding behaviors of broilers. In the first experiment, birds were injected with NPW (0.75, 1.5, and 3 nmol) in addition to saline. In the second experiment, saline, CRF1 receptor antagonist (NBI35965, 30 μg), NPW (3 nmol), and simultaneous injections of NBI35965 and NPW were performed. Experiments 3-8 were identical to experiment 2, except that CRF2 receptor antagonist (K41498, 30 μg), MC3/MC4 receptor antagonist (SHU9119, 0.5 nmol), MC4 receptor antagonist (HS024, 0.5 nmol), NPY1 receptor antagonist (BMS193885, 1.25 nmol), NPY2 receptor antagonist (CYM9484, 1.25 nmol), and NPY5 receptor (antagonist L-152,804, 1.25 nmol) were administrated instead of NBI35965. After that, cumulative feed intake and feeding behavior were monitored for 2 h and 30 min after injections, respectively. Following the infusion of NPW (1.5 and 3 nmol), there was a significant stimulation of meal consumption in chickens (P < 0.05). Concomitant injection of NBI35965 and K41498 with NPW enhanced the appetite-increasing effect of NPW (P < 0.05); while BMS193885 suppressed this effect of NPW (P < 0.05). Injection of SHU9119, HS024, CYM9484, and L-152804 with NPW at the same time, had no significant effect on NPW-induced hyperphagia (P > 0.05). NPW also significantly decreased the standing period and the number of jumps, steps, and exploratory pecks, and led to an increase in sitting period and feeding pecks (P < 0.05). Based on the observations, it seems that NPW-induced hyperphagia could be mediated through CRF1, CRF2, and NPY1 receptors in neonatal broilers.",yes,no,no,animal,effectiveness,melanocortin,,5
2023-11-06,37917630,Exercise performance is not improved in mice with skeletal muscle deletion of natriuretic peptide clearance receptor.,"Natriuretic peptides (NP), including atrial, brain, and C-type natriuretic peptides (ANP, BNP, and CNP), play essential roles in regulating blood pressure, cardiovascular homeostasis, and systemic metabolism. One of the major metabolic effects of NP is manifested by their capacity to stimulate lipolysis and the thermogenesis gene program in adipocytes, however, in skeletal muscle their effects on metabolism and muscle function are not as well understood. There are three NP receptors (NPR): NPRA, NPRB, and NPRC, and all three NPR genes are expressed in skeletal muscle and C2C12 myocytes. In C2C12 myocytes treatment with either ANP, BNP, or CNP evokes the cGMP signaling pathway. Since NPRC functions as a clearance receptor and the amount of NPRC in a cell type determines the signaling strength of NPs, we generated a genetic model with Nprc gene deletion in skeletal muscle and tested whether enhancing NP signaling by preventing its clearance in skeletal muscle would improve exercise performance in mice. Under sedentary conditions, Nprc skeletal muscle knockout (MKO) mice showed comparable exercise performance to their floxed littermates in terms of maximal running velocity and total endurance running time. Eight weeks of voluntary running-wheel training in a young cohort significantly increased exercise performance, but no significant differences were observed in MKO compared with floxed control mice. Furthermore, 6-weeks of treadmill training in a relatively aged cohort also increased exercise performance compared with their baseline values, but again there were no differences between genotypes. In summary, our study suggests that NP signaling is potentially important in skeletal myocytes but its function in skeletal muscle in vivo needs to be further studied in additional physiological conditions or with new genetic mouse models.",yes,no,no,animal,effectiveness,natriuretic,,5
2023-11-06,37917756,An indirect comparison of efficacy including histologic assessment and safety in biologic therapy in ulcerative colitis: Systemic review and network meta-analysis.,"There are currently no studies comparing histologic remission of FDA-approved biologics for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC), except for one head-to-head VARSITY trial. The current study employs a network meta-analysis to compare the efficacy, including histologic remission and safety of biologic agents for UC.Using four electronic databases, including Pubmed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov, a search was conducted of all literature published until September 2022. Included were studies of randomized controlled trials with adult patients with moderate to severe UC using biologics approved by the FDA. An odd ratio with a 95 percent credible interval and ranking information was calculated for each endpoint.The results of the network meta-analysis did not reveal statistically significant differences among biological agents. However, the ranking information for each biological agent exhibited the following patterns. Vedolizumab was ranked first for overall efficacy endpoints in the maintenance phase, including histologic remission. Except for histologic remission, Ustekinumab was identified as the top-ranked drug for induction phase efficacy endpoints other than histologic remission. Adalimumab was identified as the top-ranked drug for maintenance phase corticosteroid-free remission. Vedolizumab was identified as the top-ranked drug in the induction phase for Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE). Adalimumab was identified as the top-ranked drug in the induction phase for infection. For TEAE and infection in the maintenance phase and Treatment Emergent Severe Adverse Events (TESAE) in both the induction and maintenance phases, Ustekinumab was determined to be the top-ranked medication.Including histologic remission, for the overall efficacy endpoints in the maintenance phase, VDZ was identified as the first rank drug, but there was no statistically significant difference between biologics. Therefore, the generalization of the results of this study is bounded due to the intrinsic limitations of the study provided.",no,yes,yes,human RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,ulcerative colitis,5
2023-11-06,37920094,Long-Term Results and Risk Factors of Treatment for Post-Infarction Ventricular Septal Rupture: A Single-Center Experience.,"Ventricular septal rupture (VSR) following myocardial infarction (MI) is a rare but lethal complication. We analyzed the long-term results and risk factors for survival in the treatment of VSR.From January 2012 to December 2021, 115 consecutive patients with post-MI VSR were admitted to our hospital. Depending on different treatment methods patients were divided into following three groups: medical, transcatheter intervention, and surgical repair. During the study, relevant clinical data, operation-related conditions, and follow-up data were analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to determine the cumulative incidence of mortality. The independent risk factors for patient mortality were evaluated by multivariate logistic regression.The mean follow-up time was 43.4 ± 34.7 months. The overall in-hospital, 30-day, and long-term mortality rates were 24.3%, 38.3%, and 51.3%, respectively. In the medical group, the in-hospital and 30-day mortality rates were 46.7 % (21/45) and 82.2 % (37/45), respectively, with only three patients alive at follow-up. In the transcatheter intervention group, 30-day and long-term mortality rates were 12% and 28%, respectively. In the surgical repair group, 30-day and long-term mortality rates were 8.9% and 22.2%, respectively. Compared with the surgery-group patients, patients with transcatheter intervention had a longer time from VSR to intervention. Logistic regression analysis revealed that age, previous infarction, Killip class, serum creatinine, Troponin T, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, and medical strategy were risk factors for all-cause mortality.The 30-day and long-term outcomes of patients treated with surgical repair and transcatheter intervention were significantly better than medically treated patients.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",natriuretic,,5

Heterozygous variants of MRAP2, encoding a G coupled-protein receptor accessory protein implicated in energy control notably via the melanocortin-4 receptor, have been recently identified. A 24-year-old patient with early-onset severe obesity (body mass index [BMI]: 64 kg/m2) associated with hypertension, respiratory complications, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and type 2 diabetes was referred to our department. Sleeve gastrectomy was successful. A new heterozygous variant in MRAP2 (NM_138409.4: c.154G>C/p.G52R) variant was identified in the patient DNA. Functional assessment confirmed that this new variant was pathogenic. We report a new pathogenic loss-of-function mutation in MRAP2 in a patient suffering from a severe multicomplicated obesity. This confirms the metabolic phenotype in patients with this monogenic form of obesity. Longer follow-up will be necessary.

There is no consensus about their treatment, specifically whether SB, PPV, or PPV-SB should be performed.Systematic review and meta-analysis. Randomized controlled trials, case-control, and prospective/retrospective series (if n > 50) in English were eligible. Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched up to January 23, 2023. Standard systematic review methods were followed. The following outcomes at 3 (± 1) and 12 (± 3) months were evaluated: number of eyes with retinal reattachment after ≥ 1 surgeries, change in best-corrected visual acuity from preoperative to postoperative levels, and number of eyes with improvement of > 10 and > 15 ETDRS letters after surgery. Authors of eligible studies were asked for individual participant data (IPD) and IPD meta-analysis was undertaken. Risk of bias was assessed using National Institutes of Health study quality assessment tools. This study was registered prospectively in PROSPERO (CRD42019145626).A total of 542 studies were identified: 15 were eligible and included and 60% were retrospective. Individual participant data was obtained from 8 studies (1017 eyes). Given that only 26 patients had received SB alone, these data were not considered in the analysis. There was no evidence for differences between treatment groups (PPV versus PPV-SB) in the probability of having a flat retina at 3 or 12 months postoperatively after 1 (P = 0.067; odds ratio [OR], 0.47; P = 0.408; OR 2.55; respectively) or > 1 (OR, 0.54; P = 0.21; OR, 0.89; P = 0.926; respectively) surgery. Pars plana vitrectomy-SB showed less improvement in vision postoperatively at 3 months (estimate, 0.18; 95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.35; P = 0.044), but this difference was no longer observed at 12 months (estimate, -0.07; 95% confidence interval, -0.27, 0.13; P = 0.479).Available evidence suggests a lack of benefit of adding SB to PPV to treat RRDs with IRBs.

2023-11-09,36997794,Randomized controlled trials in central serous chorioretinopathy: A review.,"Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR), a common chorioretinal disease, presents with a myriad of manifestations. Acute CSCR presents with localized neurosensory detachment whereas chronic CSCR may show widespread retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) changes, chronic shallow subretinal fluid, and choroidal neovascularization (CNV) suggestive of a variable natural history leading to suboptimal visual outcomes. Even though multiple treatment options including laser photocoagulation, photodynamic therapy, micropulse laser, anti-vascular endothelial growth factors, and systemic drugs (spironolactone, eplerenone, melatonin, mifepristone) are available, there is an absence of any standardized treatment protocol or gold standard treatment modality. Moreover, their performance compared to observation especially in acute CSCR is still debatable. Compared to other chorioretinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular oedema, and retinal vein occlusion, there is a relative dearth of randomized controlled trials in CSCR. Multiple inconsistencies including reliance on history of disease duration, variable inclusion criteria/disease descriptors/study endpoints, and availability of multiple treatment modalities lead to difficulties in designing RCTs. A consensus-based treatment protocol, therefore, is still elusive. We reviewed the literature and compiled the list of papers published to date, wherein we analyse and compare the inclusion criteria, imaging modalities, study endpoints, study duration, and study results. Correcting these discrepancies and deficiencies will help standardize future study designs, facilitating a next step toward a standardized treatment protocol.",no,yes,yes,human RCT,effectiveness,,"retinopathy, retinal disease",5
2023-11-09,37301747,Silencing of ,"Background Marinobufagenin, NKA (Na/K-ATPase) inhibitor, causes vasoconstriction and induces fibrosis via inhibition of Fli1 (Friend leukemia integration-1), a negative regulator of collagen synthesis. In vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide), via a cGMP/PKG1 (protein kinase G1)-dependent mechanism, reduces NKA sensitivity to marinobufagenin. We hypothesized that VSMC from old rats, due to downregulation of ANP/cGMP/PKG-dependent signaling, would exhibit heightened sensitivity to the profibrotic effect of marinobufagenin. Methods and Results Cultured VSMC from the young (3-month-old) and old (24-month-old) male Sprague-Dawley rats and young VSMC with silenced PKG1 gene were treated with 1 nmol/L ANP, or with 1 nmol/L marinobufagenin, or with a combination of ANP and marinobufagenin. Collagen-1, Fli1, and PKG1 levels were assessed by Western blotting analyses. Vascular PKG1 and Fli1 levels in the old rats were reduced compared with their young counterparts. ANP prevented inhibition of vascular NKA by marinobufagenin in young VSMC but not in old VSMC. In VSMC from the young rats, marinobufagenin induced downregulation of Fli1 and an increase in collagen-1 level, whereas ANP blocked this effect. Silencing of the PKG1 gene in young VSMC resulted in a reduction in levels of PKG1 and Fli1; marinobufagenin additionally reduced Fli1 and increased collagen-1 level, and ANP failed to oppose these marinobufagenin effects, similar to VSMC from the old rats with the age-associated reduction in PKG1. Conclusions Age-associated reduction in vascular PKG1 and the resultant decline in cGMP signaling lead to the loss of the ability of ANP to oppose marinobufagenin-induced inhibition of NKA and fibrosis development. Silencing of the PKG1 gene mimicked these effects of aging.",yes,no,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",natriuretic,,5
2023-11-09,37718589,How to optimize the use of diuretics in patients with heart failure?,"Considering the pathophysiology and clinical presentation of heart failure, using diuretics or drugs with diuretic properties is indispensable for adequate management of heart failure patients. However, in clinical practice, fluid expansion is often undiagnosed, and diuretic therapy is not always adequately titrated. Today, several drug classes with diuretic properties are available in addition to classical thiazides, thiazide-like, and loop diuretics. The purpose of this short review is to discuss different ways to optimize diuretic therapy using currently available drugs. Several approaches are considered, including a combination of diuretics to obtain a sequential nephron blockade, use of a drug combining a blocker of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and an inhibitor of the metabolism of natriuretic peptides (ARNI), prescription of potassium binders to maintain and up-titrate RAS blockers and mineralocorticoid antagonists, and finally use of inhibitors of renal reabsorption of glucose through the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 system. Optimal use of these various drug classes should improve the quality of life and reduce the need for hospital admissions and mortality in heart failure patients.",yes,no,no,other,"effectiveness, safety",natriuretic,,5
2023-11-09,37935203,"Diuretic, Natriuretic, And Ca2+-Sparing Effect Of The Alkaloid Boldine In Rats.","Previous studies indicate the renal vasodilating effects of boldine, an alkaloid found in Peumus boldus. However, its potential to induce diuresis still needs to be studied.Wistar rats were used and the urine volume was noted for 8 h and further studied.The acute treatment at 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg of boldine showed a diuretic, natriuretic, and Ca2+-sparing effect in rats without changing the urinary elimination of K+and Cl-. When boldine was given in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, there was an increase in urinary volume compared to the vehicle group. However, this was not different from the treatments in its isolated form. Urine Ca2+values ​​remained low but were not enhanced by this association. The excretion of Na+and Cl- was significantly increased compared to the group that received only vehicle or boldine. On the other hand, although the association of amiloride plus boldine did not result in a diuretic effect, the increase in Na+and the reduction in K+excretion were significantly potentiated. Furthermore, in the presence of the non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine, boldine showed reduced capacity to increase urinary volume, maintaining the natriuretic and Ca2+-sparing effect, besides a very evident K+-sparing action. Similar results were obtained in the presence of the non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin. Furthermore, boldine showed an ex vivo antiurolithiasis activity, reducing calcium oxalate's precipitation and crystallization.This study reveals the diuretic, natriuretic, Ca2+-sparing, and antiurolithiatic effects of boldine, an action possibly related to muscarinic receptor activation and prostanoid generation.",yes,no,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety",natriuretic,,5
2023-11-10,37847304,Recombinant human brain natriuretic peptide attenuates ischemic brain injury in mice by inhibiting oxidative stress and cell apoptosis via activation of PI3K/AKT/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.,"Ischemic stroke followed by cerebral artery occlusion is a main cause of chronic disability worldwide. Recombinant human brain natriuretic peptide (rhBNP) has been reported to alleviate sepsis-induced cognitive dysfunction and brain I/R injury. However, the function and molecular mechanisms of rhBNP in ischemic brain injury have not been clarified. For establishment of an animal model of ischemic brain injury, C57BL/6 mice were treated with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery for 1 h and reperfusion for 24 h. After subcutaneous injection of rhBNP into model mice, neurologic deficits were assessed by evaluating behavior of mice according to Longa scoring system, and TTC staining was utilized to determine the brain infarct size of mice. The levels of oxidative stress markers, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA), were detected in hippocampal tissues of mice by corresponding kits. Cell apoptosis in hippocampus tissues was examined by TUNEL staining. Protein levels of antioxidant enzymes (HO-1 and NQO1) in cerebral cortex, apoptotic markers (Bax, Bcl-2, and cleaved caspase), and PI3K/AKT pathway-associated factors in hippocampus were tested by western blot analysis. The results revealed that injection of rhBNP decreased neurologic deficit scores, the percent of brain water content, and infarct volume. Additionally, rhBNP downregulated MDA level, upregulated the levels of SOD, CAT, and GSH in hippocampus of mice, and increased protein levels of HO-1 and NQO1 in the cortex. Cell apoptosis in hippocampus tissues of model mice was inhibited by rhBNP which was shown as the reduced TUNEL-positive cells, the decreased Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved caspase-9 protein levels, and the enhanced Bcl-2 protein level. In addition, rhBNP treatment activated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and upregulated the protein levels of HO-1 and NRF2. Overall, rhBNP activates the PI3K/AKT/HO-1/NRF2 pathway to attenuate ischemic brain injury in mice after MCAO by suppression of cell apoptosis and oxidative stress.",yes,no,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",natriuretic,,5

However, the role of lncRNA in the development of cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) is unclear. LncRNA NONRATT014888.2 is highly expressed in tibia related dorsal root ganglions (DRGs) in CIBP rats which function is unknown. CIBP was induced by injection of Walker 256 mammary gland tumor cells into the tibia canal of female SD rats. Paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) and paw withdrawal latency (PWL) of rats were measured. Down-regulation of NONRATT014888.2 by siRNA in CIBP rats markedly attenuated hind-paw mechanical pain hypersensitivity. LncRNA-predicted target mRNAs analysis and mRNA sequencing results cued Socs3, Npr3 were related with NONRATT014888.2.

Positron emission tomography is an intrinsically quantitative imaging modality suitable for high-resolution amyloid detection.This study sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a novel amyloid-reactive peptide, designated p5+14, labeled with iodine-124 (124I), in patients with diverse types of systemic amyloidosis.In a single-site, open label phase 1/2 study (NCT03678259), the safety, biodistribution, and sensitivity of a single intravenous infusion of 124I-evuzamitide was assessed in patients with systemic amyloidosis (n = 50), asymptomatic transthyretin sequence variant carriers (n = 2), and healthy volunteers (n = 5). Subjects were administered 1.4 ± 0.2 mg of 124I-evuzamitide (71.5 ± 12.4 MBq) and positron emission tomography/x-ray computed tomography images acquired at 5.2 hours (Q25-Q75: 4.9-5.4 hours) postinfusion. Images were assessed visually and semi-quantitatively for positive uptake of radiotracer in the heart and other major organs.Uptake of 124I-evuzamitide in the heart and other abdominothoracic organs was consistent with the patient's clinical presentation and the type of amyloidosis. The patient- and cardiac-associated sensitivity for imaging and clinical observations was 93.6% (95% CI: 82.8%-97.8%) and 96.2% (95% CI: 81.8%-99.8%), respectively. Semi-quantitative uptake of the radiotracer correlated significantly with serum N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide measurements in patients with light chain-associated amyloidosis. Cardiac uptake was not observed in any healthy volunteers.

Trials in IBD, therefore, should adequately represent diverse groups with respect to gender, age, place of residence, race, and ethnicity to ensure the global applicability and generalisability of their findings. In this systematic review, we searched PubMed and Embase for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in English from Jan 1, 1995, to Jan 13, 2023, evaluating the efficacy of any pharmacological intervention in patients with IBD. Of 7543 records yielded in the search, we included 617 records reporting data from 627 RCTs and 108 986 participants. The results show a paucity of adequate representation of diverse groups in these RCTs. This finding was true for various groups, including racially and ethnically diverse populations, older (aged >65 years) and younger (aged <18 years) populations, those who identify outside of the gender binary, and people from South America and Africa.

2023-11-13,37844876,The Role of Ranolazine in Heart Failure-Current Concepts.,"Heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome with a detrimental impact on mortality and morbidity. Energy substrate utilization and myocardial ion channel regulation have gained research interest especially after the introduction of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors in the treatment of heart failure. Ranolazine or N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-2-(4-[2-hydroxy-3-(2-methoxyphenoxy) propyl] piperazin-1-yl) acetamide hydrochloride is an active piperazine derivative which inhibits late sodium current thus minimizing calcium overload in the ischemic cardiomyocytes. Ranolazine also prevents fatty acid oxidation and favors glycose utilization ameliorating the ""energy starvation"" of the failing heart. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is characterized by diastolic impairment; according to the literature ranolazine could be beneficial in the management of increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, right ventricular systolic dysfunction and wall shear stress which is reflected by the high natriuretic peptides. Fewer data is evident regarding the effects of ranolazine in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and mainly support the control of the sodium-calcium exchanger and function of sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium adenosine triphosphatase. Ranolazine's therapeutic mechanisms in myocardial ion channels and energy utilization are documented in patients with chronic coronary syndromes. Nevertheless, ranolazine might have a broader effect in the therapy of heart failure and further mechanistic research is required.",yes,no,no,other,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",natriuretic,,5

A total of 408 patients who met the inclusion criteria and were diagnosed with AHF for the first time at Taicang Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine from August 2019 to January 2021 were selected as the research subjects. According to their tongue fur, the patients were divided into group A (mirror-like tongue group) and group B (non-mirror-like tongue group). The clinical characteristics and incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) within 1 year of follow-up were systematically compared between the two groups.Sixty-five patients were included in group A, and 343 patients were included in group B. There were 32 males and 33 females in group A and 168 males and 175 females in group B. The average age of the overall population was 64 years old, and the average age of group A was significantly higher than that of group B (74 vs 62 years, P < 0.001). Compared with that in group B, the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in group A was significantly lower (35% vs 42%, P < 0.001), and the log N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level was significantly higher (4.0 vs 3.4, P < 0.001). The proportion of the combined application of vasoactive drugs in group A was significantly higher than that in group B (64% vs 38%, P < 0.001). Group B had a higher proportion of coronary angiography (29.5% vs 16.9%, P = 0.038). Group A was more inclined to require mechanical ventilation than group B (33.9% vs 22.5%, P = 0.049). The length of hospital stay in group A was significantly longer than that in group B (13.1 vs 7.6, P < 0.001). The incidence of MACEs, such as recurrence of AHF, new myocardial infarction and stroke, in group A within one year was higher than that in group B (P = 0.007, 0.009, < 0.001). The incidence of cumulative MACEs in group A was significantly higher than that in group B [hazard ratio = 2.76, 95% confidence interval (1.73, 4.41), P < 0.001]. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that mirror-like tongue, age, length of stay, LVEF and log NT-proBNP were independent predictors of MACEs in patients with AHF within one year.Noninvasive tongue inspection technology can be used as a powerful tool for assessing the severity of illness and predicting prognosis in patients with AHF. A mirror-like tongue is an independent risk factor for MACEs in patients with AHF during the first year and has a combination effect with age, length of hospital stay, ejection fraction and NT-proBNP on the occurrence of MACEs.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, biomarker",natriuretic,,5

However, pulmonary vasculopathy triggered by various factors, such as chronic alveolar hypoxia or cigarette smoking, seems to play a central role in the pathogenesis of PH-CLD. While the initial workup of PH-CLD is usually complicated by an overlap of symptoms of PH and the underlying lung disease, PH-CLD should be considered when there is a discrepancy between symptoms (especially exertional dyspnea) and pulmonary function tests. Clinical suspicion of PH-CLD can be strengthened by noninvasive diagnostic tools such as transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP). However, a right heart catheterization should only be performed in specialized centers to establish the diagnosis if therapeutic consequences for the patient were expected.The basic treatment of PH-CLD is optimal management of the underlying lung disease. Among the existing interventional and registry-based studies, only a small number of data suggests favorable outcomes when treating PH-CLD patients with PAH-specific medications. Some publications even suggest negative effects. Nevertheless, recent data on inhaled vasoactive therapy in PH-CLD showed positive results for inhaled Treprostinil, although long-term data for this therapeutic approach are still lacking.

The purpose of this research is to elucidate circPRDX3 expression pattern and its underlying network in ischemic stroke (IS).Oxygen-glucose deprivation on/reoxygenation (OGD/R) and mice model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) were used to generate IS model in N2a cells or mice, respectively. Expression levels of circPRDX3, miR-641, Natriuretic Peptide Receptor 3 (NPR3), and members of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway were determined using real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot. Cell viability was assessed by CCK-8 assay and apoptosis was evaluated using TUNEL staining and flow cytometry. Molecule-molecule interactions were verified by dual luciferase and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays. The infarcted area was depicted by Triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and the level of neurological function was measured using National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS).CircPRDX3 and NPR3 were shown to be considerably downregulated in IS samples, as well as OGD/R cells or MCAO mice, while miR-641 was found to be significantly upregulated. A circPRDX3/miR-641/NPR3 mechinary was verified using luciferase and RIP assays. Overexpression of circPRDX3 dramatically reduced miR-641 expression and increased NPR3 expression, boosting cell survival and lowering apoptosis in an OGD/R model, either with inactivated MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, overexpression of circPRDX3 lowered infarct volume and enhanced neurobehavioral outcomes in mice after MCAO, and these protective effects were dramatically abrogated by depletion of NPR3.Altogether, circPRDX3 inhibited the development of IS by sponging miR-641, hence increasing NPR3 expression and inactivating MAPK pathway.

Among them, 35 patients with pulmonary embolism combined with pulmonary tuberculosis were set as the study group, and the other 35 patients with pulmonary embolism only were set as the control group. The imaging findings of chest CT examination, the incidence of pulmonary hypertension, the level of N-terminal proto-B-type brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and the prognosis of patients were compared between the two groups. The incidence of deep venous embolism was evaluated by ultrasonography of the lower extremity.In the study group, the median age of patients was 71 years, and the ratio of males to females was 2.5 to 1. In the control group, the median age was 66 years old, and the male-to-female ratio was 2.2 to 1. There were 16 cases (16/35, 45.71%) in the study group and 10 cases (10/35, 28.57%) in the control group with an increased level of NT-proBNP. Pulmonary hypertension occurred in 10 patients (10/35, 28.57%) in the study group and 7 patients (7/35, 20.00%) in the control group. Patients who lost follow-up included 5 in the study group (5/35, 14.29%) and 3 in the control group (3/35, 8.57%). There were 17 cases (17/35, 48.57%) in the study group and 3 cases (3/35, 8.57%) in the control group with pulmonary artery widening, and the difference was significant (P < 0.001). There were 13 deaths in the study group (13/35, 37.14%) and 1 death in the control group (1/35, 2.86%), and the difference was significant (P <0.001).Special signs of pulmonary artery widening, pulmonary hypertension of varying degrees, and increased levels of NT-proBNP of varying degrees can be found in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis complicated with pulmonary embolism, and the three signs are positively correlated.

Because 8-aminoinosine and 8-aminohypoxanthine are structurally similar to 8-aminoguanosine and 8-aminoguanine, respectively, we sought to define their renal excretory effects. First, we compared the ability of 8-aminoguanine, 8-aminohypoxanthine, and 8-aminoinosine to inhibit recombinant PNPase. These compounds inhibited PNPase with a potency order of 8-aminoguanine > 8-aminohypoxanthine = 8-aminoinosine. Additional studies showed that 8-aminoinosine is a competitive substrate that is metabolized to a competitive PNPase inhibitor, namely 8-aminohypoxanthine. Administration of each 8-aminopurine (33.5 µmol/kg) reduced the guanine-to-guanosine and hypoxanthine-to-inosine ratios in urine, a finding confirming their ability to inhibit PNPase in vivo. All three 8-aminopurines induced diuresis, natriuresis, and glucosuria; however, the glucosuric effects of 8-aminohypoxanthine and 8-aminoinosine were less pronounced than those of 8-aminoguanine. Neither 8-aminohypoxanthine nor 8-aminoinosine altered potassium excretion, whereas 8-aminoguanine caused antikaliuresis. In vivo administration of 8-aminoinosine increased 8-aminohypoxanthine excretion, indicating that 8-aminohypoxanthine mediates, in part, the effects of 8-aminoinosine. Finally, 8-aminohypoxanthine was metabolized to 8-aminoxanthine by xanthine oxidase. Using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we identified 8-aminoinosine as an endogenous 8-aminopurine. In conclusion, 8-aminopurines have useful pharmacological profiles. To induce diuresis, natriuresis, glucosuria, and antikaliuresis, 8-aminoguanine (or its prodrug 8-aminoguanosine) would be preferred. If only diuresis and natriuresis, without marked glucosuria or antikaliuresis, is desired, 8-aminohypoxanthine or 8-aminoinosine might be useful. Finally, here we report the in vivo existence of another pharmacologically active 8-aminopurine, namely 8-aminoinosine. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Here, we report that a family of 8-aminopurines affects renal excretory function: effects that may be useful for treating multiple diseases including hypertension, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. For diuresis and natriuresis accompanied by glucosuria and antikaliuresis, 8-aminoguanine (or its prodrug 8-aminoguanosine) would be useful; if only diuresis and natriuresis is called for, 8-aminohypoxanthine or 8-aminoinosine would be useful. Previously, we identified 8-aminoguanine and 8-aminoguanosine as endogenous 8-aminopurines; here, we extend the family of endogenous 8-aminopurines to include 8-aminoinosine.",yes,no,no,other,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",natriuretic,,5
2023-11-16,37804307,Safety and Performance of the Aortix Device in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure and Cardiorenal Syndrome.,"Cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) complicates 33% of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) admissions, and patients with persistent congestion at discharge have high 30-day event rates.The purpose of this study was to evaluate a novel catheter-deployed intra-aortic entrainment pump (IAEP) in patients with ADHF with CRS and persistent congestion.A multicenter (n = 14), nonrandomized, single-arm, safety and feasibility study of IAEP therapy was conducted. Within patient changes (post-pre IAEP therapy) in fluid loss, hemodynamics, patient-reported dyspnea, and serum biomarkers were assessed using Wilcoxon signed-rank testing.Of 21 enrolled patients, 18 received Aortix therapy. Mean ± SD patient age was 60.3 ± 7.9 years. The median left ventricular ejection fraction was 22.5% (25th-75th percentile: 10.0%-53.5%); 27.8% had a left ventricular ejection fraction ≥50%. Pre-therapy, patients received 8.7 ± 4.1 days of loop diuretic agents and 44% were on inotropes. Pump therapy averaged 4.6 ± 1.6 days, yielding net fluid losses of 10.7 ± 6.5 L (P < 0.001) and significant (P < 0.01) reductions in central venous pressure (change from baseline: -8.5 mm Hg [25th-75th percentile: -3.5 to -10.0 mm Hg]), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (-11.0 mm Hg [25th-75th percentile: -5.0 to -14.0 mm Hg]), and serum creatinine (-0.2 mg/dL [25th-75th percentile: -0.1 to -0.5 mg/dL]) with improved estimated glomerular filtration rate (+5.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 [25th-75th percentile: 2.0-9.0 mL/min/1.73 m2]) and patient-reported dyspnea score (+16 [25th-75th percentile: 3-37]). Dyspnea scores, natriuretic peptides, and renal function improvements persisted through 30 days.This pilot study of patients with ADHF, persistent congestion, and worsening renal function due to CRS supports the potential for safely achieving decongestion using IAEP therapy. These initial promising results provide the basis for future randomized clinical trials of this novel pump.

2023-11-17,37870005,Comparison of micropulse subthreshold laser plus anti-VEGF versus anti-VEGF alone in diabetic macular edema: Systematic review.,"Intravitreal injection of anti- Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)is commonly used to treat patients with diabetic macular edema (DME). However, the injection alone requires high cost and compliance. Combining micropulse subthreshold laser (MPSL) and anti-VEGF is a new approach to treating DME. This study intended to answer the question of whether MPSL plus anti-VEGF is effective compared to anti-VEGF alone. The following terms were used in PubMed, clinicaltrial.gov, and Google Scholar: anti-VEGF, DME, MPSL, and diabetic retinopathy. All studies of DME comparing the intervention of MPSL plus anti-VEGF and VEGF alone between the years 2017-2021 were included. Studies with no comparison between the intervention and control group, abstract-only papers, case reports, case series, and systematic review studies were excluded. Five Randomized Controlled Trial (RCTs) and three retrospective studies were analyzed. Four studies found that best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improved in both therapies. Central macular thickness in six studies was also improved. The improvement differences between both therapies were insignificant and the number of anti-VEGF injections was significantly lower in combination therapy. These studies show equal outcomes of both therapies. The reduced number of anti-VEGF injections of the combination therapy could improve the management of DME in terms of cost-effectiveness. Further analysis should be conducted to pool the data from the studies and evaluate the overall outcome.",no,yes,yes,human RCT,effectiveness,,retinopathy,5
2023-11-20,35412887,A hypothalamic pathway for Augmentor α-controlled body weight regulation.,"Augmentor α and β (Augα and Augβ) are newly discovered ligands of the receptor tyrosine kinases Alk and Ltk. Augα functions as a dimeric ligand that binds with high affinity and specificity to Alk and Ltk. However, a monomeric Augα fragment and monomeric Augβ also bind to Alk and potently stimulate cellular responses. While previous studies demonstrated that oncogenic Alk mutants function as important drivers of a variety of human cancers, the physiological roles of Augα and Augβ are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the physiological roles of Augα and Augβ by exploring mice deficient in each or both Aug ligands. Analysis of mutant mice showed that both Augα single knockout and double knockout of Augα and Augβ exhibit a similar thinness phenotype and resistance to diet-induced obesity. In the Augα-knockout mice, the leanness phenotype is coupled to increased physical activity. By contrast, Augβ-knockout mice showed similar weight curves as the littermate controls. Experiments are presented demonstrating that Augα is robustly expressed and metabolically regulated in agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons, cells that control whole-body energy homeostasis in part via their projections to the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Moreover, both Alk and melanocortin receptor-4 are expressed in discrete neuronal populations in the PVN and are regulated by projections containing Augα and AgRP, respectively, demonstrating that two distinct mechanisms that regulate pigmentation operate in the hypothalamus to control body weight. These experiments show that Alk-driven cancers were co-opted from a neuronal pathway in control of body weight, offering therapeutic opportunities for metabolic diseases and cancer.",yes,no,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",melanocortin,,5
2023-11-20,37971992,Clinical effectiveness of screening for age-related macular degeneration: A systematic review.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye disease that occurs in patients over 50 years old. Early diagnosis enables timely treatment to stabilize disease progression. However, the fact that the disease is asymptomatic in its early stages can delay treatment until it progresses. As such, screening in specific contexts can be an early detection tool to reduce the clinical and social impact of the disease.Assess the effectiveness of screening methods for early detection of AMD in adults aged 50 years or older.A systematic review of comparative observational studies on AMD screening methods in those aged 50 years or older, compared with no screening or any other strategy. A literature search was conducted in the MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, Cochrane Library and Lilacs database.A total of 5,290 studies were identified, three of which met the inclusion criteria and were selected for the systematic review. A total of 8,733 individuals (16,780 eyes) were included in the analysis. The screening methods assessed were based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) compared with color fundus photography, and OCT and telemedicine testing compared to a standard eye exam.The systematized data are limited and only suggest satisfactory performance in early screening of the population at risk of developing AMD.

2023-11-20,37974062,An effective prediction model based on XGBoost for the 12-month recurrence of AF patients after RFA.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart rhythm disorder that can lead to complications such as stroke and heart failure. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a procedure used to treat AF, but it is not always successful in maintaining a normal heart rhythm. This study aimed to construct a clinical prediction model based on extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) for AF recurrence 12 months after ablation.The 27-dimensional data of 359 patients with AF undergoing RFA in the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from October 2018 to November 2021 were retrospectively analysed. We adopted the logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and XGBoost methods to conduct the experiment. To evaluate the performance of the prediction, we used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), the area under the precision-recall curve (AP), and calibration curves of both the training and testing sets. Finally, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) were utilized to explain the significance of the variables.Of the 27-dimensional variables, ejection fraction (EF) of the left atrial appendage (LAA), N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), global peak longitudinal strain of the LAA (LAAGPLS), left atrial diameter (LAD), diabetes mellitus (DM) history, and female sex had a significant role in the predictive model. The experimental results demonstrated that XGBoost exhibited the best performance among these methods, and the accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision and F1 score (a measure of test accuracy) of XGBoost were 86.1%, 89.7%, 71.4%, 62.5% and 0.67, respectively. In addition, SHAP analysis also proved that the 6 parameters were decisive for the effect of the XGBoost-based prediction model.We proposed an effective model based on XGBoost that can be used to predict the recurrence of AF patients after RFA. This prediction result can guide treatment decisions and help to optimize the management of AF.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,effectiveness,natriuretic,,5

The safety and pharmacokinetics of TCMCB07 are demonstrated in healthy beagle dogs.The objectives of this study were to investigate the safety, peak plasma concentrations, and potential for efficacy of TCMCB07 in pet dogs with naturally occurring cachexia over a 4-week time period.Fourteen dogs with cachexia of any underlying cause, except cancer of the oral cavity or gastrointestinal tract, were eligible for enrollment with informed client consent.This study was a prospective, 1-armed open-label trial. Physical examination, complete blood count, chemistry panel, and owner-assessed quality of life surveys were checked at weeks 1, 2, and 4. Due to potential for bradycardia and hypotension, Holter monitoring and blood pressure evaluations were scheduled at pre-enrollment and week 4.Fourteen dogs completed the trial. Significant changes detected included increased mean body weight (18.6-19.5 kg, P < .02), increased body condition score (median Tufts 5-point thin dog scale score P < .004 and WSAVA muscle condition score P < .02) and increased mean blood urea nitrogen (21.79-30.43 mg dL-1 , P < .004). On quality of life surveys, pet owners perceived their dog appeared to be panting less (P < .002) and that the general health improved (P < .03). Four dogs had a change in coat pigmentation.

2023-11-22,37815701,A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials on the Prevention and Treatment of Pouchitis after Ileoanal Pouch Anastomosis.,"This systematic review explored different medications and methods for prevention and treatment of pouchitis after restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA).PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for randomized clinical trials that assessed prevention or treatment of pouchitis. The systematic review was reported in line with updated 2020 PRISMA guidelines. Risk of bias in the trials included was assessed using the ROB-2 tool and certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE. The main outcomes were the incidence of new pouchitis episodes in the preventative studies and resolution or improvement of active pouchitis in the treatment studies.Fifteen randomized trials were included. A meta-analysis of 7 trials on probiotics revealed significantly lower odds of pouchitis with the use of probiotics (RR: 0.26, 95% CI: 0.16-0.42, I2 = 20%, p < 0.001) and similar odds of adverse effects to placebo (RR: 2.43, 95% CI: 0.11-55.9, I2 = 0, p = 0.579). One trial investigated the prophylactic role of allopurinol in preventing pouchitis and found a comparable incidence of pouchitis in the two groups (31% vs 28%; p = 0.73). Seven trials assessed different treatments for active pouchitis. One recorded the resolution of pouchitis in all patients treated with ciprofloxacin versus 67% treated with metronidazole. Both budesonide enema and oral metronidazole were associated with similar significant improvement in pouchitis (58.3% vs 50%, p = 0.67).

2023-11-22,37902905,Clinical characteristics and prognostic impact of immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated myocarditis in advanced non-small cell lung cancer.,"Myocarditis is a rare immune-related adverse events (irAEs) with high mortality rates, with few reports on its clinical characteristics and prognostic impact. This study designed to explore the associations between cardiac parameters and outcomes of myocarditis in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI). Fourteen patients diagnosed with ICI-associated myocarditis by clinicians were admitted to the study analysis. By Cox univariate and multivariate survival analyses, potential risk factors for the development of severe myocarditis were identified. Survival analysis was also performed to explore the prognosis of patients with myocarditis. Among patients with myocarditis, higher B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels (P = 0.04) and conduction block (P = 0.03) were associated with progression to severe myocarditis. In addition, high lactate dehydrogenase (LHD) levels (P = .04) and myocarditis onset within 2 months (P = 0.02) were prognostic factors of severe myocarditis. The median progression-free survival (PFS) time and median overall survival (OS) time for all patients were 5.9 months and 18.5 months, respectively. However, there were no statistical differences between mild and severe cohorts in terms of PFS and OS (PFS: 4.5 vs. 8.5 months, P = 0.17; OS: 21.3 vs. 18.5months, P = 0.36). And we found that the earlier occurrence of myocarditis, worse PFS prognosis (4.5 months vs. 10.5 months, P = 0.008), while no difference in OS (18.5 months vs. 21.3 months, P = 0.35). Compared to mild myocarditis, severe myocarditis presented with higher BNP levels and cardiac conduction abnormalities.

2023-11-22,37987517,Face-down positioning or posturing after macular hole surgery.,"Macular holes cause severe impairment of sight. With the aim of improving the outcome of surgery for macular holes, particularly larger macular holes (those measuring over 400 μm), a variable period of face-down positioning may be advised. This review is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2011.To evaluate the effect of postoperative face-down positioning on the outcome of surgery for macular hole.We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2022, Issue 5), which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, the ISRCTN registry, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. There were no date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 25 May 2022.We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which postoperative face-down positioning was compared to no face-down positioning following surgery for macular holes. The primary outcome of interest was closure of the macular hole. Other outcomes of interest included visual outcomes, quality of life outcomes, and the occurrence of adverse events. Pairs of review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and evaluated the certainty of evidence using GRADE.We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We analysed dichotomous data as risk ratios (RRs), and continuous data as mean differences (MDs), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The unit of analysis was eyes.We included eight studies allocating a total of 709 eyes (699 participants). There was heterogeneity in study design, including the control group treatment (from no positioning to strict maintenance of other 'face-forward' postures) and surgical procedures (with or without inner limiting membrane peeling, with or without cataract surgery). There were also different durations of positioning, with two studies using 3 days, two studies using 5 days, and three studies using 10 days of face-down positioning. Whilst the overall risk of bias was low, all included studies were judged to be at high or unclear risk of bias due to absence of assessment of adherence to the 'prescribed' intervention of face-down positioning or posturing. The primary outcome of successful anatomical hole closure at one to six months following surgery was reported in 95 of every 100 eyes of participants advised to position face-down for at least three days after surgery, and in 85 of every 100 eyes of participants not advised to position face-down (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.12, 709 eyes, 8 studies, I² = 44%). Amongst the 327 eyes of participants with macular holes of at least 400 μm, hole closure was noted in 94 of every 100 eyes of participants advised to position face-down, and in 84 of every 100 eyes of participants not advised to position face-down (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.26, 5 studies, I² = 62%). Amongst the 129 eyes of participants with macular holes of less than 400 μm, hole closure was noted in 100 of every 100 eyes of participants advised to position face-down, and in 96 of every 100 eyes of participants not advised to position face-down (RR 1.03, CI 0.97 to 1.11, 4 studies, I² = 0%). The certainty of the evidence was low, downgraded for imprecision (CIs including no effect) and study design limitations (with different durations of face-down posturing used in the absence of a dose-response gradient, and limitations in measuring the exposure). Meta-analysis of visual acuity data was challenging given the use of different definitions of postoperative visual outcome across studies. Three studies reported findings by gain in Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters (MD 2.04, 95% CI -0.01 to 4.09, very low-certainty evidence). Meta-analyses of quality of life data were not possible because of inconsistency in outcome metrics across studies. One study reported no difference between groups in quality of life, as reported on a validated quality of life metric scale (the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire - 25 (NEI VFQ-25), between face-down positioning for five days and non-face-down positioning (median NEI VFQ-25 score was 89 (interquartile range (IQR) 76 to 94) in the face-down group versus 87 (IQR 73 to 93) in the non-face-down group (adjusted mean difference on a logistic scale 0.02, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.07, P = 0.41)). Two studies reported increased ease of positioning and less pain in non-face-down positioning groups on non-validated 0-to-10-point visual analogue scores. On an ease-of-positioning score running from 0 (very difficult) to 10 (very easy), there were consistent reports of the discomfort associated with face-down positioning: the median participant-reported ease-of-positioning score was 6 (IQR 4 to 8) in those undergoing 5 days of face-down positioning versus 9 (IQR 7 to 10) in the comparator group (P = 0.01). On a pain score with 0 being pain-free and 10 being in severe pain, mean pain score was 6.52 ± 2.48 in the face-down positioning group versus 2.53 ± 2.6 in the non-face-down positioning group. The adverse event of postoperative nerve compression occurred in less than 1 in every 100 (3 per 1000) participants advised to position face-down, and 0 in every 100 participants not advised to position face-down (699 participants, 8 studies, moderate-certainty evidence).We identified eight RCTs evaluating face-down positioning following surgery for macular hole. The included studies were not all directly comparable due to differences in the surgical techniques used and the durations of postoperative positioning advised. Low-certainty evidence suggests that face-down positioning may have little or no effect on macular hole closure after surgery. Face-down positioning is a low-risk intervention, with serious adverse events affecting fewer than 1 in 300 people. We suggest that any future trials focus on patients with larger macular holes, with interventions and outcome measures used in previous trials (i.e. with inner limiting membrane peeling, positioning durations of three to five days, and validated quality of life metrics) to allow future meta-analyses to determine any effect with greater precision and confidence.",no,yes,yes,human RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,retinal disease,5

Here, we sought to systematically quantify the associations of APOE haplotypes with age-related ocular diseases and to assess their scope and age-dependency.We included genetic and registry data from 412,171 Finnish individuals in the FinnGen study. Disease endpoints were defined using nationwide registries. APOE genotypes were directly genotyped using Illumina and Affymetrix arrays or imputed using a custom Finnish reference panel. We evaluated the disease associations of APOE genotypes containing ε2 (without ε4) and ε4 (without ε2) compared with the ε3ε3 genotype using logistic regressions stratified by age.APOE ε4 enriched haplotypes were inversely associated with overall glaucoma (odds ratio [OR] = 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.92-0.99, P = 0.0047), and its subtypes POAG (OR = 0.95, P = 0.027), normal-tension glaucoma (OR = 0.87, P = 0.0058), and suspected glaucoma (OR = 0.95, P = 0.014). Individuals with the ε4 allele also had lower odds for AMD (OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.76-0.84, P < 0.001), seen both in dry and neovascular subgroups. A slight negative association was also detected in senile cataract, but this was not reproducible in age-group analyses.Our results support prior evidence of the inverse association of APOE ε4 with glaucoma, but the association was weaker than for AMD. We could not show an association with exfoliation glaucoma, supporting the hypothesis that APOE may be involved in regulating retinal ganglion cell degeneration rather than intraocular pressure.",no,yes,yes,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, biomarker",,"retinopathy, retinal disease",5
2023-11-23,37933567,Natriuretic Peptide Receptor B Protects Against Atrial Fibrillation by Controlling Atrial cAMP Via Phosphodiesterase 2.,"β-AR (β-adrenergic receptor) stimulation regulates atrial electrophysiology and Ca2+ homeostasis via cAMP-dependent mechanisms; however, enhanced β-AR signaling can promote atrial fibrillation (AF). CNP (C-type natriuretic peptide) can also regulate atrial electrophysiology through the activation of NPR-B (natriuretic peptide receptor B) and cGMP-dependent signaling. Nevertheless, the role of NPR-B in regulating atrial electrophysiology, Ca2+ homeostasis, and atrial arrhythmogenesis is incompletely understood.Studies were performed using atrial samples from human patients with AF or sinus rhythm and in wild-type and NPR-B-deficient (NPR-B+/-) mice. Studies were conducted in anesthetized mice by intracardiac electrophysiology, in isolated mouse atrial preparations using high-resolution optical mapping, in isolated mouse and human atrial myocytes using patch-clamping and Ca2+ imaging, and in mouse and human atrial tissues using molecular biology.Atrial NPR-B protein levels were reduced in patients with AF, and NPR-B+/- mice were more susceptible to AF. Atrial cGMP levels and PDE2 (phosphodiesterase 2) activity were reduced in NPR-B+/- mice leading to larger increases in atrial cAMP in the presence of the β-AR agonist isoproterenol. NPR-B+/- mice displayed larger increases in action potential duration and L-type Ca2+ current in the presence of isoproterenol. This resulted in the occurrence of spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release events and delayed afterdepolarizations in NPR-B+/- atrial myocytes. Phosphorylation of the RyR2 (ryanodine receptor) and phospholamban was increased in NPR-B+/- atria in the presence of isoproterenol compared with the wildtypes. C-type natriuretic peptide inhibited isoproterenol-stimulated L-type Ca2+ current through PDE2 in mouse and human atrial myocytes.NPR-B protects against AF by preventing enhanced atrial responses to β-adrenergic receptor agonists.",yes,no,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",natriuretic,,5

2023-11-24,37993841,Efficacy and safety of first-line combination therapy versus monotherapy for vitreoretinal lymphoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Vitreoretinal lymphoma (VRL) is usually treated with a combination of intraocular methotrexate (ioMTX), high-dose intravenous methotrexate (HD-MTX), or local radiotherapy (RT) as the first options. The effectiveness and safety of monotherapy like bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi) for PVRL remain uncertain.A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trial data and conference abstracts in VRL patients treated with first-line combination therapy or monotherapy were conducted through a search of PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases until December 2022. A total of 24 studies comprising 517 patients were included, and survival data were extracted from 279 patients due to inconsistent units across studies.The combined treatment group used ioMTX + chemotherapy (in 4 studies), RT + chemotherapy (in 2 studies), ioMTX/HD-MTX based regimen (in 2 studies), ioMTX + RT + chemotherapy (in 2 studies), ioMTX + lenalidomide/BTKi (in 2 studies) and combination of multiple therapies (in 7 studies). The monotherapy group was mainly treated with oral monotherapies such as BTKi. The combination therapy had a higher overall response rate (ORR) and complete response rate (CRR) than monotherapy (ORR: 96% vs. 72%, CRR: 92% vs. 63%). Combination therapy also resulted in a longer median progression-free survival (28.8 months vs. 13 months, p = 0.012). However, the combination therapy group had more severe side effects (grade 3/4 toxicity) than the monotherapy group (45% vs. 8%).The study showed combination therapy had better OR and CR rates, longer survival, and more toxicity than monotherapy. While BTK inhibitors were well-tolerated, long-term effectiveness needs confirmation from prospective studies. In addition, given the small number of studies of monotherapy for VRL, more studies are needed to validate its effects.CRD42023400305.",no,yes,yes,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,retinopathy,5

Diabetes affects multiple organ systems leading to comorbidities including hypertension. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) recently have been approved for the treatment of T2DM and heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction. Retrospective analyses of clinical trials have noted SGLT2 inhibitors to have a promising effect on blood pressure. Moreover, the observed blood pressure reduction is not just an acute effect of treatment initiation but has been shown to have a long-term impact on both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The mechanism of action leading to the blood pressure reduction is still unclear; however, proposed mechanisms are related to the natriuretic effect, modification of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and/or the reduction in the sympathetic nervous system, SGLT2i should be considered as second-line medication in those patients with diabetes or heart disease and concomitant hypertension.

A random-effects model was used to pool the results after incorporating the influence of potential heterogeneity.A total of nine RCTs involving 1295 patients with DED were included in the meta-analysis. Compared to treatment with 0.1% HA, topical treatment with 3% diquafosol significantly improved the Ocular Surface Disease Index (mean difference (MD): - 3.59, 95% confidence interval (CI): - 4.68 to - 2.50, p < 0.001; I2 = 6%), results of Schirmer's test (MD: 1.08 mm, 95% CI: 0.41 to 1.76, p = 0.002; I2 = 0%), tear breakup time (MD: 0.60 s, 95% CI: 0.20 to 0.99, p = 0.003; I2 = 63%), corneal fluorescein staining score (MD: - 0.20, 95% CI: - 0.37 to - 0.03, p = 0.02; I2 = 58%), and ocular rose bengal staining score (MD: - 0.62, 95% CI: - 0.88 to - 0.35, p < 0.001; I2 = 15%).

We assessed the echocardiographic 3D left ventricular (LV) strain of patients with FD in relation to heart failure severity using natriuretic peptides, the presence of a cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) late gadolinium enhancement scar, and long-term prognosis.3D echocardiography was feasible in 75/99 patients with FD [aged 47 ± 14 years, 44% males, LV ejection fraction (EF) 65 ± 6% and 51% with hypertrophy or concentric remodelling of the LV]. Long-term prognosis (death, heart failure decompensation, or cardiovascular hospitalization) was assessed over a median follow-up of 3.1 years. A stronger correlation was observed for N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels with 3D LV global longitudinal strain (GLS, r = -0.49, P < 0.0001) than with 3D LV global circumferential strain (GCS, r = -0.38, P < 0.001) or 3D LVEF (r = -0.25, P = 0.036). Individuals with posterolateral scar on CMR had lower posterolateral 3D circumferential strain (CS; P = 0.009). 3D LV-GLS was associated with long-term prognosis [adjusted hazard ratio 0.85 (confidence interval 0.75-0.95), P = 0.004], while 3D LV-GCS and 3D LVEF were not (P = 0.284 and P = 0.324).3D LV-GLS is associated with both heart failure severity measured by natriuretic peptide levels and long-term prognosis.

2023-11-27,37522273,Novel enhancers of guanylyl cyclase-A activity acting via allosteric modulation.,"Guanylyl cyclase-A (GC-A), activated by endogenous atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), plays an important role in the regulation of cardiovascular and renal homeostasis and is an attractive drug target. Even though small molecule modulators allow oral administration and longer half-life, drug targeting of GC-A has so far been limited to peptides. Thus, in this study we aimed to develop small molecular activators of GC-A.Hits were identified through high-throughput screening and optimized by in silico design. Cyclic GMP was measured in QBIHEK293A cells expressing GC-A, GC-B or chimerae of the two receptors using AlphaScreen technology. Binding assays were performed in membrane preparations or whole cells using 125 I-ANP. Vasorelaxation was measured in aortic rings isolated from Wistar rats.We have identified small molecular allosteric enhancers of GC-A, which enhanced ANP or BNP effects in cellular systems and ANP-induced vasorelaxation in rat aortic rings. The mechanism of action appears novel and not mediated through previously described allosteric binding sites. In addition, the selectivity and activity depend on a single amino acid residue that differs between the two similar receptors GC-A and GC-B.We describe a novel allosteric binding site on GC-A, which can be targeted by small molecules to enhance ANP and BNP effects. These compounds will be valuable tools in further development and proof-of-concept of GC-A enhancement for the potential use in cardiovascular therapy.",yes,no,no,in vitro,"effectiveness, biomarker",natriuretic,,5

The value-based healthcare (VBHC) approach has been proposed as a strategic and methodological framework to ensure the delivery of the best patient outcomes with economic efficiency. Through the illustrative example of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP) for heart failure (HF) patient management in the context of the Italian National Healthcare system, this article explores the role that in vitro diagnostics (IVDs) can play in enabling value-based care models.14 healthcare professionals representing the relevant professional figures involved in HF patient management met to revise the current HF patient journey and design a new care pathway that, leveraging on BNP/NT-proBNP, reflects the VBHC principles.The literature recognizes the dosage of BNP/NT-proBNP as the gold stan-dard for diagnosing HF. However, as of today, these IVDs are not employed at their full potential regarding HF patient management. A new patient journey is proposed so that patients are diagnosed early and properly monitored in the aftermath of hospitalization, improving outcomes at contained costs.As testified by the example of HF patient management in Italy, laboratory medicine can represent a lever for adopting value-based care models. Still, large-scale adoption of VBHC will call for structural reforms that revise how healthcare delivery is organized, measured, and reimbursed.",yes,no,no,other,"diagnostic, effectiveness",natriuretic,,5
2023-11-27,38003551,Functional Characterization of Novel ,"The leptin-melanocortin pathway is pivotal in appetite and energy homeostasis. Pathogenic variants in genes involved in this pathway lead to severe early-onset monogenic obesity (MO). The MC4R gene plays a central role in leptin-melanocortin signaling, and heterozygous variants in this gene are the most common cause of MO. A targeted gene panel consisting of 52 obesity-related genes was used to screen for variants associated with obesity. Variants were analyzed and filtered to identify potential disease-causing activity and validated using Sanger sequencing. We identified two novel heterozygous variants, c.253A>G p.Ser85Gly and c.802T>C p.Tyr268His, in the MC4R gene in two unrelated patients with morbid obesity and evaluated the functional impact of these variants. The impact of the variants on the MC4R gene was assessed using in silico prediction tools and molecular dynamics simulation. To further study the pathogenicity of the identified variants, GT1-7 cells were transfected with plasmid DNA encoding either wild-type or mutant MC4R variants. The effects of allelic variations in the MC4R gene on cAMP synthesis, MC4R protein level, and activation of PKA, ERB, and CREB signaling pathways in both stimulated and unstimulated ɑ-MSH paradigms were determined for their functional implications. In silico analysis suggested that the variants destabilized the MC4R structure and affected the overall dynamics of the MC4R protein, possibly leading to intracellular receptor retention. In vitro analysis of the functional impact of these variants showed a significant reduction in cell surface receptor expression and impaired extracellular ligand binding activity, leading to reduced cAMP production. Our analysis shows that the variants do not affect total protein expression; however, they are predicted to affect the post-translational localization of the MC4R protein to the cell surface and impair downstream signaling cascades such as PKA, ERK, and CREB signaling pathways. This finding might help our patients to benefit from the novel therapeutic advances for monogenic forms of obesity.",yes,no,no,in vitro,"effectiveness, biomarker",melanocortin,,5
2023-11-27,38003973,Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Left Ventricular Filling Pressure Is Associated with NT-proBNP in Patients with New Onset Heart Failure.,"Background and Objectives: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is emerging as an important imaging tool for sub-phenotyping and estimating left ventricular (LV) filling pressure (LVFP). The N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is released from cardiac myocytes in response to mechanical load and wall stress. This study sought to investigate if CMR-derived LVFP is associated with the serum levels of NT-proBNP and, in addition, if it provides any incremental prognostic value in heart failure (HF). Materials and Methods: This study recruited 380 patients diagnosed with HF who underwent same-day CMR and clinical assessment between February 2018 and January 2020. CMR-derived LVFP was calculated, as previously, from long- and short-axis cines. During CMR assessment, serum NT-proBNP was measured. The pathological cut-offs were defined as follows: NT-proBNP ≥ 125 pg/mL and CMR LVFP > 15 mmHg. The incidence of HF hospitalisation was treated as a clinical outcome. Results: In total, 305 patients had NT-proBNP ≥ 125 pg/mL. Patients with raised NT-proBNP were older (54 ± 14 vs. 64 ± 11 years, p < 0.0001). Patients with raised NT-proBNP had higher LV volumes and mass. In addition, CMR LVFP was higher in patients with raised NT-proBNP (13.2 ± 2.6 vs. 15.4 ± 3.2 mmHg, p < 0.0001). The serum levels of NT-proBNP were associated with CMR-derived LVFP (R = 0.42, p < 0.0001). In logistic regression analysis, this association between NT-proBNP and CMR LVFP was independent of all other CMR variables, including LV ejection fraction, LV mass, and left atrial volume (coefficient = 2.02, p = 0.002). CMR LVFP demonstrated an independent association with the incidence of HF hospitalisation above NT-proBNP (hazard ratio 2.7, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 6, p = 0.01). Conclusions: A CMR-modelled LVFP is independently associated with serum NT-proBNP levels.

This retrospective cohort study aimed to examine the effects of undernutrition and HF on outcomes in patients who underwent convalescent rehabilitation after hip fracture. Undernutrition was defined as body mass index (BMI) < 20.0 (Low BMI). Heart failure (HF) was defined as a B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) > 100 (High BNP). The study outcomes included the Functional Independence Measure motor domain (FIM-motor) and cognitive domain (FIM-cognition) at discharge. To consider the effects of low BMI, high BNP, and the simultaneous presence of both (""low BMI and high BNP""), we used multivariate linear regression analyses to examine whether these were associated with the outcomes. A total of 110 (mean age 87.4 years, 24.8% male) were analyzed. As a result, low BMI (β = -0.088, p = 0.027) and high BNP (β = -0.053, p = 0.015), each alone, were significantly associated with the FIM motor at discharge, whereas the simultaneous presence of ""low BMI and high BNP"" was significantly associated with the FIM motor at discharge, while the strength of the association was greater than each association alone (β = -0.152, p = 0.010). Further, the simultaneous presence of ""low BMI and high BNP"" was significantly associated with FIM cognition at discharge (β = -0.109, p = 0.014).

This study evaluated the impact of rhBNP on emergency dialysis and prognosis in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients with type 4 CRS, and the risk factors of emergency dialysis. This retrospective cohort study included patients with type 4 CRS and ESRD admitted for decompensated heart failure between January 2016 and December 2021. Patients were divided into the rhBNP and non-rhBNP cohorts, according to whether they were prescribed rhBNP. The primary outcomes were emergency dialysis at first admission and cardiovascular events within a month after discharge. A total of 77 patients were included in the rhBNP cohort (49 males and 28 females, median age 67) and 79 in the non-rhBNP cohort (47 males and 32 females, median age 68). After adjusting for age, residual renal function, and primary diseases, Cox regression analysis showed that rhBNP was associated with emergency dialysis (HR = 0.633, 95% CI 0.420-0.953) and cardiovascular events (HR = 0.410, 95% CI 0.159-0.958). In addition, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (OR = 0.782, 95% CI 0.667-0.917, P = 0.002) and procalcitonin (PCT) levels (OR = 1.788, 95% CI 1.193-2.680, P = 0.005) at the first visit were independent risk factors for emergency dialysis while using rhBNP was a protective factor for emergency dialysis (OR = 0.195, 95% CI 0.084-0.451, P < 0.001).

However, the clinical effectiveness of conbercept and ranibizumab remains controversial.This meta-analysis aimed to compare the effectiveness of conbercept and ranibizumab for treating ROP.We systematically searched Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Ovid, Scopus, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database, CQVIP, Duxiu Database, SinoMed, and X-MOL to screen relevant studies up to November 2022. Retrospective cohort studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effectiveness of conbercept and ranibizumab in treating patients with ROP were selected. The outcomes assessed were the rates of primary cure, ROP recurrence, and retreatment. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata.Seven studies (n = 989) were selected in the meta-analysis. There were 303 cases (594 eyes) treated with conbercept and 686 patients (1,318 eyes) treated with ranibizumab. Three studies reported the primary cure rate. Compared to ranibizumab, conbercept had a significantly higher primary cure rate (odds ratio [OR] 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-3.49, P < 0.05).

We aim to determine treatment response, long-term right ventricular (RV) functional stability and prognosis of patients with PAH reaching or maintaining the RVEF 45% threshold.Incident, treatment-naive, adult PAH patients with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and first follow-up were included (total N=127) and followed until date of censoring or death/lung transplantation. Patients were categorised into two groups based on 45% RVEF. Baseline predictors, treatment response and prognosis were assessed with logistic regression analyses, two-way analysis of variance and log-rank tests.Patients were 50±17 years old, 73% female, of which N=75 reached or maintained the 45% RVEF threshold at follow-up (RVEF≥45%@FU), while N=52 patients did not (RVEF<45%@FU). RV end-diastolic volume and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide at baseline were multivariable predictors of an RVEF ≥45% at follow-up. A 40% pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) reduction resulted in greater improvement in RV function (ΔRVEF 17±11 vs. 5±8; pinteraction<0.001) compared to a PVR reduction <40%, but did not guarantee an RVEF ≥45%. Finally, the 45% RVEF threshold was associated with stable RV function during long-term follow-up and better survival (HR: 1.91 (95% CI: 1.11 to 3.27)). Patients failing to reach or maintain the 45% RVEF threshold at first follow-up mostly stayed below this threshold over the next consecutive visits.After treatment initiation, 60% of patients with PAH reach or maintain the 45% RVEF threshold, which is associated with a long-term stable RV function and favourable prognosis.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, biomarker",natriuretic,,5
2023-11-29,37607811,Sleep-disordered breathing and cardiovascular disease: who and why to test and how to intervene?,"Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is common in individuals with established cardiovascular disease (CVD), particularly those with heart failure (HF). There are two main types of SDB, central sleep apnoea (CSA) and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) which frequently overlap as mixed SDB. Investigating for SDB could be considered in patients with excessive daytime sleepiness, male sex, high body mass index, low ejection fraction, atrial fibrillation (AF), in patients with no dipping blood pressure pattern, recurrent paroxysms of nocturnal dyspnoea or when an apnoea is witnessed. Excessive daytime sleepiness is less likely to be reported by patients with HF than by the general population. In patients with CVD and OSA, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ventilation for over 4 hours daily reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, but there was no reduction in mortality. In patients with AF and OSA treated with AF ablation, CPAP use was associated with a reduced risk of recurrence of AF. In patients with HF and OSA, small studies have demonstrated that CPAP improves symptoms, brain natriuretic peptide levels and ejection fraction, but data on survival are lacking. Treatment remains unclear in patients with HF and CSA. The presence of CSA may be a defensive adaptive response to HF, and effectively treating CSA as demonstrated in a randomised clinical trial of adaptive servo-ventilation caused more harm than benefit when compared to optimal medical therapy. Thus, the focus of treating CSA should remain on improving the underlying HF by optimising medical therapy and, if indicated, cardiac resynchronisation therapy.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",natriuretic,,5
2023-11-29,37697738,The cost-effectiveness of NT-proBNP for assessment of suspected acute heart failure in the emergency department.,"When relying on clinical assessment alone, an estimated 22% of acute heart failure (AHF) patients are missed, so clinical guidelines recommend the use of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) for AHF diagnosis. Since publication of these guidelines, there has been poor uptake of NT-proBNP testing in part due to concerns over excessive false positive referrals resulting from the low specificity of a single 'rule-out' threshold of <300 pg/mL. Low specificity can be mitigated by the addition of age-specific 'rule-in' NT-proBNP thresholds.A theoretical hybrid decision tree/semi-Markov model was developed, combining global trial and audit data to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of NT-proBNP testing using age-specific rule-in/rule-out (RI/RO) thresholds, compared with NT-proBNP RO only and with clinical decision alone (CDA). Cost-effectiveness was measured as the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained and incremental net health benefit. In the base case, using UK-specific inputs, NT-proBNP RI/RO was associated with both greater QALYs and lower costs than CDA. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20 000/QALY, NT-proBNP RO was also cost-effective compared with CDA [incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £8322/QALY], but not cost-effective vs. RI/RO (ICER of £64 518/QALY). Overall, NT-proBNP RI/RO was the most cost-effective strategy. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were undertaken; the conclusions were not impacted by plausible variations in parameters, and similar conclusions were obtained for the Netherlands and Spain.An NT-proBNP strategy that combines an RO threshold with age-specific RI thresholds provides a cost-effective alternative to the currently recommended NT-proBNP RO only strategy, achieving greater diagnostic specificity with minimal reduction in sensitivity and thus reducing unnecessary echocardiograms and hospital admissions.",yes,no,no,other,effectiveness,natriuretic,,5

Inclusion criteria were chronic heart failure (HF) with New York Heart Association ≥II symptoms and an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP > 100 pg/mL or N-terminal-pro-BNP > 1000 pg/mL). Patient assessments were performed remotely and included measurements of body weight, blood pressure, heart rate, symptoms, biochemical parameters, and data from cardiac implantable electronic devices when available. In total, 161 patients (71 ± 11 years old, 79% male) were followed for a mean of 291 ± 66 days with a mean adherence to the remote monitoring system of 80 ± 20%. Over this period, 52 (32.3%) patients had 105 WHF events, of which 66 (63%) were successfully managed remotely, the remaining requiring hospitalization. Freedom from WHF events and hospitalization at 300 days were 66% and 85%, respectively (P < 0.001 for the difference). Increased level of BNP was associated with an increased risk of WHF event [hazard ratio (HR) per unit increase in BNP: 1.001; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1-1.002; P = 0.001] and hospitalization (HR 1.002; 95% CI 1.002-1.003; P = 0.002). A decrease in the level of glomerular filtration rate was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization (HR per unit decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate: 0.946; 95% CI 0.906-0.989; P = 0.014). WHF event recurrence and (re)hospitalization rates at 1-month were similar among patients managed remotely (18% and 12%, respectively) and those requiring hospitalization (21% and 10%, respectively). Iatrogenic complications occurred more often during hospitalization than remote management (26% vs. 3%, P < 0.001).Our study suggests that remote management of WHF events based on a multiparametric approach led by a telemedical centre is feasible and safe. Adopting such a strategy for patients with chronic HF could reduce HF-related hospitalizations with expected benefits for patients, care providers, and health care systems.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,"safety, effectiveness",natriuretic,,5
2023-11-29,37957201,Melanocortin-4 receptor in macrophages attenuated angiotensin II-induced abdominal aortic aneurysm in mice.,"Obesity is recognized as an independent risk factor for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). While mutations in the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) gene is the most common cause of obesity caused by mutations in a single gene, the link between MC4R function and vascular disease has still remained unclear. Here, by using melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) deficient mice, we confirmed MC4R deficiency promotes AAA and atherosclerosis. We demonstrated the contribution of two novel factors towards vascular vulnerability in this model: leptin signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and loss of MC4R signaling in macrophages. Leptin was shown to promote vascular vulnerability via PI3K-dependent upregulation of Spp1 expression in VSMC. Additionally, Ang II-induced AAA incidence was significantly reduced when MC4R gene expression was myeloid cell-specifically rescued in MC4R deficient (MC4RTB/TB) mice. Ex vivo analysis showed a suppression in NF-κB activity in bone marrow-derived macrophages from LysM(+);MC4RTB/TB mice compared to LysM(-);MC4RTB/TB mice, which exaggerates with endogenous MC4R ligand treatment; α-MSH. These results suggest that MC4R signaling in macrophages attenuates AAA by inhibiting NF-κB activity and subsequent vascular inflammation.",yes,no,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",melanocortin,,5
2023-11-30,37578211,A Comparison of Treatment Effect Sizes in Matched Phase 2 and Phase 3 Trials of Advanced Therapeutics in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Phase 2 trials are fundamental to the rational and efficient design of phase 3 trials. We aimed to determine the relationship of treatment effect size estimates from phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials on advanced therapeutics in inflammatory bowel disease.MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and the Cochrane library were searched from inception to December 19, 2022, to identify paired phase 2 and 3 placebo-controlled induction studies of advanced therapeutics for Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Treatment effect sizes were expressed as a risk ratio (RR) between the active arm and placebo arm. For the same therapeutics, RRs from phase 2 trials were divided by the RR from phase 3 trial to quantify the relationship of effect sizes between phases.Twenty-two studies (9 phase 2 trials, 13 phase 3 trials) were included for CD and 30 studies (12 phase 2 trials, 18 phase 3 trials) for UC. In UC (pooled RR 0.72; 95% confidence interval: 0.58-0.86; RR <1 indicates smaller treatment effect sizes in phase 2 trials), but not CD (pooled RR 1.01; 95% confidence interval: 0.84-1.18), phase 2 trials systematically underestimated treatment effect sizes for the primary endpoint compared with phase 3 trials. The underestimation was observed for clinical, but not endoscopic, endpoints in UC.Treatment effect sizes for the primary and clinical endpoints were similar across clinical trial phases in CD, but not UC, where only endoscopic endpoints were comparable. This will help inform clinical development plans and future trial design.",no,yes,yes,human non-RCT,effectiveness,,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",5
2023-11-30,37982428,Infliximab for medical induction of remission in Crohn's disease.,"Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds and neutralises tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), which is present in high levels in the blood serum, mucosa and stool of people with Crohn's disease.To evaluate the benefits and harms of infliximab alone or in combination with another agent for induction of remission in Crohn's disease compared to placebo or active medical therapies.On 31 August 2021 and 4 March 2023, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization ICTRP.Randomised control trials (RCTs) comparing infliximab alone or in combination with another agent to placebo or another active comparator in adults with active Crohn's disease.Pairs of review authors independently selected studies and conducted data extraction and risk of bias assessment. We expressed outcomes as risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Our primary outcomes were clinical remission, clinical response and withdrawals due to adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were endoscopic remission, histological remission, endoscopic response, and serious and total adverse events.The search identified 10 RCTs with 1101 participants. They were conducted between 1999 and 2019, and 7/10 RCTs included biologically naive participants. All but one RCT, which did not provide information, were multicentre and funded by pharmaceutical companies, and their authors declared conflicts. The age of the participants ranged from 26 to 65 years. Results were based on one study unless otherwise stated. Infliximab 5 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg may be more effective than placebo at week four for clinical remission (30/55 versus 3/25; RR 4.55, 95% CI 1.53 to 13.50; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 3) and response (36/55 versus 4/25; RR 4.09, 95% CI 1.63 to 10.25, NNTB 3). The evidence was low certainty. The study did not report withdrawals due to adverse events. We could not draw conclusions on the effects of infliximab 5 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg compared to placebo for fistulating participants for clinical remission (29/63 versus 4/31; RR 3.57, 95% CI 1.38 to 9.25; NNTB 4), response (48/106 versus 15/75; RR 1.94, 95% CI 1.10 to 3.41; NNTB 6; 2 studies) or withdrawals due to adverse events (2/63 versus 0/31; RR 2.50, 95% CI 0.12 to 50.54). The evidence was very low certainty. Infliximab used in combination with purine analogues is probably more effective than purine analogues alone for clinical remission at weeks 24 to 26 (182/301 versus 95/302; RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.59 to 2.32, NNTB 4; 4 studies; moderate-certainty evidence) and clinical response at week 26 (107/177 versus 66/178; RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.05; NNTB 5; 2 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events at week 26 (62/302 versus 53/301; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.21; 4 studies; low-certainty evidence). Infliximab alone may be more effective than purine analogues alone at week 26 for clinical remission (85/177 versus 57/178; RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.95; NNTB 7; 2 studies) and response (94/177 versus 66/178; RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.82; NNTB 7; 2 studies). There may be little or no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events (30/177 versus 43/178; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.06; 4 studies). The evidence was low certainty. We could not draw any conclusions on the effects of infliximab 5 mg/kg compared to 10 mg/kg for clinical remission (19/27 versus 11/28; RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.02) and response (22/27 versus 24/28; RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.46). The evidence was very low certainty. Withdrawals due to adverse events were not reported. We could not draw any conclusions on the effects of infliximab 5 mg/kg compared to 10 mg/kg in an exclusively fistulating population for clinical remission (17/31 versus 12/32; RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.84 to 2.53), response (21/31 versus 18/32; RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.78), or withdrawals due to adverse events (1/31 versus 1/32; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.79). The evidence was very low certainty. We could not draw any conclusions on the effects of infliximab 5 mg/kg compared to 20 mg/kg for clinical remission (19/27 versus 11/28; RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.02) or response (22/27 versus 18/28; RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.76). The evidence was very low certainty. Withdrawals due to adverse events were not reported. We could not draw any conclusions on the effects of infliximab 10 mg/kg compared to 20 mg/kg for clinical remission (11/28 versus 11/28; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.92) or response (14/28 versus 18/28; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.23). The evidence was very low certainty. Withdrawals due to adverse events were not reported. There may be little or no difference between infliximab and a CT-P13 biosimilar at week six for clinical remission (47/109 versus 49/111; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.32), response (67/109 versus 70/111; RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.20) and withdrawals due to adverse events (21/109 versus 17/111; RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.25). The evidence was low certainty.Infliximab in combination with purine analogues is probably more effective than purine analogues alone in inducing clinical remission and clinical response. Infliximab alone may be more effective in inducing clinical remission and response than purine analogues alone or placebo. Infliximab may be similar in efficacy to a CT-P13 biosimilar and there may be little or no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events. We were unable to draw meaningful conclusions as to whether infliximab alone is effective when used for exclusively fistulating populations. There was evidence that there may be little or no difference in withdrawal due to adverse events between infliximab plus purines compared with purines alone, as well as infliximab alone compared with purines alone. Meaningful conclusions cannot be drawn on all other outcomes related to adverse events due to very low certainty evidence.",no,yes,yes,human RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,crohn's disease,5
2023-11-30,38018554,FISTULIZING PERIANAL CROHN'S DISEASE: IS THE PATIENT'S SEX A BURDEN? A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW.,"Fistulizing perianal Crohn's disease poses a treatment challenge, and researchers postulate that this phenotype in young male patients could have a worst outcome.Thus, the aim of this study was to assess whether sex influences the response to treatment for these patients.This systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42022319629) was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol. We selected articles published in English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian between 2010 and 2020 in the PubMed and Science Direct databases. According to the PICO acronym, prospective studies in patients older than 18 years with the objective of treating fistulizing perianal Crohn's disease were selected. Studies in pediatric populations, retrospective, without treatment objectives, and that included only rectovaginal fistulas or a single sex were excluded. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and Newcastle-Ottawa scale.Of the 1887 articles found, 33 were included. Most studies used anti-TNF drugs as treatment (n=11). Ten studies had subgroup analyses; of them, the two studies reporting sex differences used infliximab and adalimumab as treatment and showed that women had a longer fistula closure time than men.This systematic review showed that few data corroborate the difference between sexes in the treatment of fistulizing perianal Crohn's disease, possibly having a greater relationship with the phenotype. However, considering the lack of results, further studies with this objective and with standardization of fistulas and response assessment methods are needed.",no,yes,yes,human non-RCT,effectiveness,,crohn's disease,5

Optical coherence tomography angiography revealed no angioflow into the retinal arterioles of the cavity. An arterial filling delay to the retinoschisis with extensive leakage from the RNV was noted on fluorescein angiography. Case 2 involved the superficial retinoschisis and telangiectatic vessels inside the schisis cavity. Optical coherence tomography angiography revealed damage to the superficial capillary plexus of the cavity, absence of angioflow to the inner schisis layer, and increased angioflow to the RNV. Fluorescein angiography showed focal leakage from the RNV and diffuse leakage from telangiectasia. No vision-threatening complications were identified in either patient up to the last follow-up, subsequent to laser photocoagulation.Acquired peripheral retinoschisis is associated with RNV. Inner retinal ischemia caused by hemodynamic resistance or a damaged superficial capillary plexus can interrupt angioflow to the inner schisis retinal layer on optical coherence tomography angiographic findings and develop RNV inside or outside the retinoschisis.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"safety, biomarker",,retinal disease,4

The mean baseline best-corrected visual acuity was 0.25 ± 0.17 (Snellen equivalent 20/38.3 ± 16.9). Fundus photography demonstrated a yellowish lesion overlying the fovea. Optical coherence tomography imaging revealed a hyperreflective preretinal lesion with a mean vertical length of 267 μ m (range 185-497) and a mean greatest linear diameter of 312 µ m (range 124-640). There was no vitreoretinal abnormality including vitreomacular traction or epiretinal membrane noted in any eye, and two of six eyes displayed a definitive posterior vitreous detachment. These nodules may have occurred before and persisted even after a posterior vitreous detachment or may have been acquired after the posterior vitreous detachment. The nodules typically remained stable with minimal change although in one eye, a posterior vitreous detachment occurred 6 months after initial presentation and lifted the gliosis off of the retinal surface where it remained attached to the posterior hyaloid.Foveal nodular epiretinal gliosis may occur due to subclinical hyaloidal traction on the Müller cell cone even without obvious vitreoretinal interface abnormality on optical coherence tomography.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"safety, diagnostic",,retinal disease,4
2023-11-01,37187323,Real-World Experience With Tofacitinib Dose De-Escalation in Patients With Moderate and Severe Ulcerative Colitis.,"Tofacitinib is associated with sustained steroid-free remission in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), with the lowest effective dose recommended for maintenance therapy. However, there are limited real-world data to guide decisions on the optimal maintenance regimen. We aimed to evaluate predictors and outcomes of disease activity after tofacitinib dose de-escalation in this population.Included were adults with moderate-severe UC treated with tofacitinib between June 2012 and January 2022. The primary outcome was evidence of UC disease activity-related events: hospitalization/surgery, corticosteroid initiation, tofacitinib dose increase, or therapy switch.Among 162 patients, 52% continued 10 mg twice daily while 48% underwent dose de-escalation to 5 mg twice daily. Cumulative incidence rates of UC events at 12 months were similar in patients with and without dose de-escalation (56% vs 58%; P = .81). In univariable Cox regression among patients with dose de-escalation, an induction course with 10 mg twice daily for more than 16 weeks was protective of UC events (hazard ratio [HR], 0.37; 95% CI, 0.16-0.85) while ongoing severe disease (Mayo 3) was associated with UC events (HR, 6.41; 95% 95% CI, 2.23-18.44), which remained significant after adjusting for age, sex, duration of induction course, and corticosteroid use at dose de-escalation (HR, 6.05; 95% CI, 2.00-18.35). Twenty-nine percent of patients with UC events had their dose re-escalated to 10 mg twice daily, with only 63% able to recapture clinical response at 12 months.In this real-world cohort, we observed a 56% cumulative incidence of UC events at 12 months in patients with tofacitinib dose de-escalation.

Visual acuity (VA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) features such as central subfield thickness (CSFT), subretinal fluid (SRF), intraretinal fluid, and pigment epithelial detachment (PED) were recorded at baseline, first month, and third month.Of the 25 eyes, 14 eyes were treatment-naïve and 11 eyes had received previous injections. VA improved from 0.68 ± 0.59 log MAR at baseline to 0.31 ± 0.43 log MAR at the end of 3 months. SRF height in first and third month was significantly reduced from baseline (P < 0.001). Subretinal hyperreflective material height significantly reduced from baseline (P value 0.008 at first month and 0.01 at third month, respectively). CSFT was 464.16 ± 247.97 microns at baseline and showed a significant reduction in first month (P < 0.001) and third month (P < 0.001). There was a significant reduction of PED height from baseline at both follow-ups.

A complete ophthalmological examination was done and findings were tabulated. Their hospital admission records were checked for severity of coma, recovery, and prognosis. Data were analyzed with SPSS software, and P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Total 113 children of age group 0-18 years (mean age 7.88 ± 0.56 years) were enrolled in the study. Seventy-seven children (68.14%) had retinal changes. Most common retinal signs associated with malarial retinopathy were white centered hemorrhage and papilledema (53.09% each), followed by retinal whitening (51.33%) and vessel changes (39.82%). The correlation between the presence of white centered retinal hemorrhages and visual prognosis was found to be statistically significant (P = 0.001). Patients with Grade 4 parasitemia showed maximum retinal signs with a significant correlation between the severity of papilledema and parasite load (P = 0.037). Eighty-six patients (76.11%) survived and 27 patients (23.89%) died. All 27 patients who died showed all four signs of malarial retinopathy.

2023-11-01,37792693,Radiomics-Based Prediction of Anti-VEGF Treatment Response in Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration With Pigment Epithelial Detachment.,"Machine learning models based on radiomic feature extraction from clinical imaging data provide effective and interpretable means for clinical decision making. This pilot study evaluated whether radiomics features in baseline optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of eyes with pigment epithelial detachment (PED) associated with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) can predict treatment response to as-needed anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy.Thirty-nine eyes of patients with PED undergoing anti-VEGF therapy were included. All eyes underwent a loading dose followed by as-needed therapy. OCT images at baseline, month 3, and month 6 were analyzed. Images were manually separated into non-responding, recurring, and responding eyes based on the presence or absence of subretinal fluid at month 6. PED radiomics features were then extracted from each image and images were classified as responding or recurring using a machine learning classifier applied to the radiomics features.Linear discriminant analysis classification of baseline features as responsive versus recurring resulted in classification performance of 64.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.63-0.65), area under the curve (AUC = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.72-0.82), sensitivity 0.79 (95% CI = 0.63-0.87), and specificity 0.58 (95% CI = 0.50-0.67). Further analysis of features in recurring eyes identified a significant shift toward non-responding mean feature values over 6 months.Our results demonstrate the use of radiomics features as predictors for treatment response to as-needed anti-VEGF therapy. Our study demonstrates the potential for radiomics feature in clinical decision support for personalizing anti-VEGF therapy.The ability to use PED texture features to predict treatment response facilitates personalized clinical decision making.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinal disease,4

The main outcome was improvement ≥ 2 steps in ETDRS diabetic retinopathy severity scale (DRSS) levels. Different strategies for eyes receiving IVC within or over 1 month after PRP were analyzed. For patients with DRSS improvement < 2 steps and presence of vision-threatening adverse events, a binary logistic regression method was used to select risk factors.Sixty one eyes were involved in this study. After treated with combination therapy with a median number of 3 injections, 44% of eyes improved ≥ 2 steps in DRSS levels. A total of 14 eyes (23%) occurred vision-threatening adverse events. No significant difference was found in eyes receiving conbercept within or over 1 month after PRP.

2023-11-01,37803163,Retinal vascular occlusion risks during the COVID-19 pandemic and after SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported to affect vascular networks including the eye. However, evidence on the causal relationship between COVID-19 infection and retinal vascular occlusions remains limited. This study aimed to determine the change in retinal vascular occlusion incidence during COVID-19 era and whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection induces retinal vascular occlusion. Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and retinal artery occlusion (RAO) incidences during 2018-2019 and 2020-July 2021 were compared, those in confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients diagnosed from 2020 to January 2021 were calculated, and those in COVID-19 patients during 180 days prior and 180 days after diagnosis were assessed. Additionally, the standardized incidence ratio of RVOs in COVID-19 patients was analyzed. Incidence rates per 100,000 people/year of RVO during 2018-2019 and 2020-2021 was 102.0 and 98.8, respectively. RAO incidence rates during 2018-2019 and 2020-2021 were 11.7 and 12.0, respectively. In both confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients, the incidence of RVO and RAO did not change significantly from 180 days before to after diagnosis in the adjusted model. RVO incidence slightly decreased while RAO incidence increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Several studies have detected ocular manifestations in patients after COVID-19. However, little is known about the retinal and vitreal alterations in patients before and after COVID-19 infection. This study aimed to investigate the retinal and vitreal alterations in patients before and after contracting COVID-19 infection using swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) and angiography (SS-OCTA). A total of 38 participants (76 eyes) were enrolled and followed-up 1 month after COVID-19 infection. Then, 26 patients (52 eyes) were evaluated 3 months after COVID-19 infection. Compared with the pre-COVID-19 status, patients with 1- and 3-month post-COVID-19 statuses had significant thinning of ganglion cell and inner plexiform layer, thickening of inner nuclear layer, a decrease in the vessel density (VD) of superficial vascular complex, and an increase in the VD of deep vascular complex. Meanwhile, alteration in parameters of foveal avascular zone (all p < 0.05) and hyper-reflective dots in the vitreous of 27 patients (54 eyes) (71.1% vs. pre-COVID-19, 34.2%, p = 0.006) were observed. These findings suggest significantly retinal and vitreal alterations occurred in patients after COVID-19 infection, possibly due to direct or indirect virus-induced injuries.

2023-11-01,37816824,Aniseikonia after reduced-fluence photodynamic therapy in patients with central serous chorioretinopathy.,"This study investigated aniseikonia after reduced-fluence photodynamic therapy (RFPDT) for central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC). We examined 48 eyes of 48 patients (38 men; mean age, 49.2 ± 9.9 years) with CSC resolved after RFPDT. Horizontal and vertical aniseikonia were measured using the New Aniseikonia Test at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months after RFPDT. The maximum absolute value of the horizontal and vertical measurements indicated the aniseikonia score. The aniseikonia score was 2.2 ± 2.3 at 6 months and 2.2 ± 2.0 at 12 months after RFPDT, both of which improved significantly from the baseline score of 4.1 ± 2.9 (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). The 12-month aniseikonia score significantly correlated with the baseline aniseikonia score (P = 0.047), outer nuclear thickness at baseline (P = 0.027) and 12 months after RFPDT (P = 0.014), baseline SRD area (P = 0.005), and ellipsoid zone disruption at 12 months after RFPDT (P = 0.021). In multivariate analysis, baseline serous retinal detachment (SRD) area (P = 0.034) was significantly associated with aniseikonia score at 12 months after RFPDT.

2023-11-01,37828057,"Prevalence of depression, anxiety and suicidal ideas and associated factors, in particular sensory impairments, in a population of Bashkortostan in Russia.","To assess prevalence and associated factors of depression, anxiety and suicidal ideas in populations from Russia, we conducted in rural and urban regions in Bashkortostan/Russia two population-based studies (Ural Eye and Medical Study (UEMS), performed from 2015 to 2017; Ural Very Old Study (UVOS), performed from 2017 to 2020) which included participants aged 40 + years and 85 + years, respectively. Depression was assessed using the questionnaire of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale Scoresheet, and anxiety was examined applying the State Trait Inventory Anxiety Test. Suicidal ideas were explored by the question whether suicide had previously been thought of or attempted (and if yes, for what reasons). In the statistical analysis we assessed the mean of the main outcome parameter (depression score and anxiety score) and searched for associations between these parameters and other parameters in univariable and multivariable regression analyses. In the UEMS with 5893 individuals (age: 59.0 ± 10.7 years; range 40-94 years), higher depression score and anxiety score were associated (multivariable analysis) with more marked hearing loss (beta: 0.07; P < 0.001, and beta: 0.07; P < 0.0012, respectively) and worse visual acuity (beta: 0.04; P = 0.02; and beta: 0.03; P = 0.03, resp.), in addition to female sex, Russian ethnicity, lower educational level, less alcohol consumption, weaker hand grip strength, less physical activity, and higher prevalence of dry eye disease. Attempted suicide was reported by 88 (1.5%; 95% CI 1.2, 1.8) participants. Having thought of suicide within the last 6 months was reported by 63 (1.1%) individuals. Out of 1491 UVOS participants (age: 88.2 ± 2.8 years; range 85-100 years) with a mean depression score of 20.0 ± 10.3 (median 18; range 0-58), 916 (61.4%; 95% CI 59.0, 63.9) fulfilled the definition of depression (depressions core ≥ 16). Higher depression score and higher anxiety score correlated (multivariable analysis) with higher hearing loss score (beta: 0.07; P = 0.02, and beta: 0.08; P = 0.009, resp.) and worse visual acuity (beta: 0.13; P < 0.001, and beta: 0.09; P = 0.007, resp.), in addition to female sex, urban region, less physical activity, less fruit intake, and lower cognitive function. Overall, 15 (1.0%; 95% CI 0.50, 1.50) individuals had attempted or thought of suicide. In conclusion, the findings suggest that besides female sex, lower level of education and lower cognitive function, it was sensory impairment, namely vision and hearing impairment, which belonged to the determinants of depression and anxiety in these populations from Russia.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, biomarker",,dry eye,4
2023-11-01,37833631,Depression symptoms increase the risk for initiation or switching to biologic therapy in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease patients in remission.,"Anxiety and depression symptoms are common in IBD population, both adult and pediatric patients. Increased psychological distress might contribute to initiation and switching to biologic therapy in adult patients with IBD or other chronic inflammatory diseases. Aim of the present study are to evaluate anxiety and depression symptoms in IBD pediatric patients with disease remission and investigate their role in initiation or switching to biologic therapy.We performed a retrospective analysis on IBD pediatric patients, assessing for anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (PHQ-9) symptoms. Demographic and disease characteristics were obtained from medical records.Eighty-six patients [31 (36%) females - mean age = 15.6 (SD = 2.8) years] were included. Patients scored above cut-off (> 10) on PHQ-9 and GAD-7 were 17 (19.7%) and 18 (20.9%), respectively. No differences were found between UC and CD patients. Baseline clinically relevant depression symptoms were significantly associated with the odds of initiating or switching to biologic therapy within 2 years [OR = 4.5 (1.4-14.3)], even after confounders adjustment [4.2 (1.2-14.9)]. Relationship was not significant with anxiety symptoms.Anxiety and depression symptoms is relatively common in pediatric IBD population, even with disease remission. Pediatric IBD patients with high depression symptoms are at increased risk of initiating or switching to biologic therapy. Mental health screening programs should be incorporated in routine clinical practice, especially for depression, regardless of disease activity and disease type.

2023-11-01,37840443,Mesenchymal stem cell therapy in aqueous deficient dry eye disease.,"Dry eye disease (DED) is characterized by ocular dryness, irritation and blurred vision and has a significant impact on the patient's quality of life. This condition can be particularly severe in patients with aqueous deficient dry eye disease (ADDE) due to Sjögren's syndrome (SS), an autoimmune disease that affects the lacrimal and salivary glands. Current treatments for ADDE are often limited to symptomatic relief. A literature review was conducted to explore the current surgical interventions used or tested in humans with ADDE (I). These interventions include procedures involving the eyelids and tear ducts, transplantation of amniotic membrane or salivary glands, injections around the tear ducts and cell-based injections into the lacrimal gland (LG). Each treatment has its advantages and disadvantages; however, treating dry eyes in patients with SS presents a particular challenge due to the systemic nature of the disease. Moreover, there is a need for new therapeutic options. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a type of stem cell that have shown promise in regenerating damaged tissue and reducing inflammation in various diseases. Previous studies in animal models have suggested that MSCs could be effective in treating ADDE. Thus, this thesis aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of injecting MSCs into the LG as a treatment option for patients with ADDE secondary to SS. The study also aims to see this treatment in light of existing and novel investigational treatment options. The clinical studies conducted for this thesis are the first of their kind in humans. MSCs derived from healthy donors' adipose tissue (ASCs) were cultured in a laboratory, frozen and thawed ready for use. In the safety study, we performed the first human trial involving the administration of a single injection of ASCs into the LG of one eye in seven patients suffering from severe ADDE (II). The primary objective was to test the safety of this treatment, while the secondary objective was to assess improvements in subjective and objective signs of dry eye. The results of the trial showed no serious side effects within 4 months of follow-up after treatment. On average, there was a 40% reduction in dry eye symptoms assessed with the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire. Additionally, in the treated eye, there was a significant decrease in tear osmolarity, an increase in tear film stability and an increase in tear production. To further investigate the efficacy of this treatment, our research group performed a clinical, randomized study aiming to compare the ASC injection into the LG with the injection of a vehicle (the excipient in which the ASCs are dissolved) and observation (no intervention) (III). The study involved 20 subjects receiving ASC injection, 20 subjects receiving vehicle injection and 14 patients being observed without intervention. The subjects were examined to assess the outcomes with a 12-month follow-up after treatment. Both intervention groups showed a significant reduction in subjective dry eye symptoms of approximately 40%. This improvement was evident at the 1-week follow-up and persisted until the 12-month follow-up. The observation group did not experience any change in OSDI score. The ASCs group exhibited a significant mean increase in non-invasive tear break-up time (NIKBUT) of 6.48 s (149%) at the four-week follow-up, which was significantly higher than that in the vehicle group (p = 0.04). Moreover, the ASCs group showed a significant increase in NIKBUT compared to that in the observation group at the 12-month follow-up (p = 0.004). In both the ASCs and vehicle group, a significant increase in Schirmer test scores at the 4-month follow-up and the 12-month follow-up was observed. In conclusion, this thesis contributes valuable findings with a new treatment option for patients with dry eye disease. Injection of ASCs into the LG was shown to be safe and to improve subjective dry eye symptoms and specifically the tear film stability in patients with ADDE due to SS. Compared to other treatment modalities of ADDE, this treatment has greater potential, as ASCs could potentially be used as an anti-inflammatory therapeutic option for managing DED of other causes as well. RESUMÉ (DANISH SUMMARY): Tørre øjne, karakteriseret ved tørhedsfornemmelse og irritation af øjnene samt sløret syn, har en betydelig indvirkning på patientens livskvalitet. Denne tilstand kan vaere saerligt alvorlig hos patienter med nedsat tåreproduktion (ADDE) som følge af Sjögrens syndrom (SS), en autoimmun sygdom, der påvirker tårekirtlerne og spytkirtlerne. Nuvaerende behandlinger for ADDE er ofte begraenset til symptomlindring. Vi gennemførte en litteraturgennemgang for at undersøge, hvilke nuvaerende kirurgiske behandlingsmetoder, der anvendes eller testes hos patienter med ADDE (I). Disse interventioner inkluderer procedurer, der involverer øjenlåg og tårekanaler, transplantation af amnionhinde eller spytkirtler, injektioner omkring tårekanalerne samt cellebaserede injektioner i tårekirtlen. Hver behandling har sine fordele og ulemper, men behandling af tørre øjne hos patienter med SS udgør en saerlig udfordring på grund af sygdommens systemiske udbredning, og der er behov for nye behandlingsmuligheder. Mesenkymale stamceller (MSCs) er en type stamcelle, der har vist lovende resultater med hensyn til at regenerere beskadiget vaev og reducere inflammation i forskellige sygdomme. Tidligere undersøgelser i dyremodeller har indikeret, at MSCs kan vaere en effektiv behandling af ADDE. Denne afhandling har til formål at undersøge sikkerheden og effekten af injektion af MSCs i tårekirtlen som en mulig behandling til patienter med ADDE som følge af SS. Afhandlingen sigter også mod at sammenligne denne behandling med andre eksisterende, kirurgiske behandlingsmuligheder af ADDE. Som led i dette projekt udførte vi de første kliniske forsøg af sin art i mennesker. MSCs fra raske donorers fedtvaev (ASCs) blev dyrket i et laboratorium, frosset ned og er optøet klar til brug. Det første mål var at teste sikkerheden ved denne behandling og sekundaert at undersøge behandlingens effekt. For at undersøge dette modtog syv forsøgspersoner med svaer ADDE én injektion med ASCs i tårekirtlen på det ene øje (II). Resultaterne af forsøget viste ingen alvorlige bivirkninger inden for fire måneders opfølgning efter behandlingen. I gennemsnit fandt vi yderligere en 40% reduktion i symptomer på tørre øjne vurderet med et spørgeskema, og en markant stigning i tåreproduktionen og af tårefilmens stabilitet i det behandlede øje. For yderligere at undersøge effekten af denne behandling udførte vi et klinisk, randomiseret forsøg med det formål at sammenligne injektion af ASCs i tårekirtlen med injektion af en kontrolopløsning (vaesken, hvor stamcellerne var opløst) og observation (ingen intervention) (III). Studiet omfattede 20 forsøgspersoner, der modtog ASC-injektion, 20 forsøgspersoner, der modtog injektion af kontrolopløsningen, og 14 forsøgspersoner i observationsgruppen. Forsøgspersonerne blev undersøgt med en opfølgningstid på 12 måneder efter behandling. Begge interventionsgrupper viste en betydelig reduktion på ca. 40% i subjektive symptomer på tørre øjne. Denne forbedring var betydelig allerede ved opfølgning efter en uge og varede ved 12 måneder efter behandling. Observationsgruppen oplevede ingen betydelig aendring i symptomer. ASCs gruppen viste desuden en signifikant stigning i tårefilmsstabiliteten (NIKBUT) på 6,48 sekunder (149%) ved opfølgning efter fire uger, hvilket var markant højere end efter injektion af kontrolopløsning (p = 0,04). Desuden viste ASCs gruppen en betydelig stigning i NIKBUT sammenlignet med observationsgruppen ved opfølgning efter 12 måneder (p = 0,004). Både injektion af ASCs og kontrolopløsning medførte en betydelig stigning i tåreproduktionen ved opfølgning fire måneder og 12 måneder efter behandling. Denne afhandling bidrager med vigtige resultater inden for en ny behandlingsmulighed af tørre øjne. Injektion af ASCs i tårekirtlen viste sig at vaere sikker, forbedrede subjektive symptomer på tørre øjne og øgede saerligt tårfilmens stabilitet hos patienter med ADDE på grund af SS. Sammenlignet med andre behandlingsmuligheder for ADDE har denne behandling vist et stort potentiale. ASCs kan muligvis også bruges som en anti-inflammatorisk behandling af tørre øjne af andre årsager i fremtiden.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"safety, effectiveness",,dry eye,4

Tear film and ocular surface evaluation were performed at baseline, postoperative week 1, and month 1. Measurements obtained using the Schirmer I test and invasive tear-film breakup time (I-TBT) were compared with non-invasive evaluation of the tear break-up time (NI-TBT), tear meniscus height (TMH) and blink analysis obtained using the MYAH device. Findings were correlated with the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire in all subjects.The study included 80 eyes of 40 consecutive patients (21 males and 19 females) with a mean age of 26.6 ± 5.9 years (18-40 years) and a mean spherical equivalent value of -3.64 D (-9.63 to -0.25 D). There was a significant decrease in Schirmer I test (19.21 ± 8.4 vs. 16.61 ± 9.1 vs. 14.69 ± 9.86, p= 0.02, respectively) and I-TBT values (8.59 ± 3.4 vs. 7.4 ± 3.25 vs. 6.17 ± 3.01, p=0.03 respectively). OSDI values showed a significant increase after LASIK (11.56 ± 6.3 vs. 17.24 ± 7.5 vs. 14.71 ± 9.6, p=0.03, respectively). 5% level NI-TBT was significantly lower at 1 week 6.75 and 1 month 7.45 than baseline 13.2 at follow-up (p=0.037). Ocular protection index (6.6 vs. 2.3 vs. 2.6, p=0.009, respectively) and blink/minutes (18 vs. 17 vs. 15, p=0.002, respectively) values showed a statistically significant decrease. Our data detected a weak correlation between I-TBT and noninvasive first TBT, 5% level TBT parameters at month 1 follow-up.

2023-11-01,37863593,"Hereditary transthyretin amyloid neuropathies: advances in pathophysiology, biomarkers, and treatment.","Hereditary transthyretin (TTR) amyloid polyneuropathy is an autosomal dominant life-threatening disorder. TTR is produced mainly by the liver but also by the choroid plexus and retinal pigment epithelium. Detailed clinical characterisation, identification of clinical red flags for misdiagnosis, and use of biomarkers enable early diagnosis and treatment. In addition to liver transplantation and TTR stabilisers, three other disease-modifying therapies have regulatory approval: one antisense oligonucleotide (inotersen) and two small interfering RNAs (siRNAs; patisiran and vutrisiran). The siRNAs have been shown to stop progression of neuropathy and improve patients' quality of life. As none of the disease-modifying therapies can cross the blood-brain barrier, TTR deposition in the CNS, which can cause stroke and cognitive impairment, remains an important unaddressed issue.

For eyes with persistent retinal thickening despite anti-VEGF therapy, treatment with intravitreal triamcinolone may be considered, especially in pseudophakic eyes. The aim of this study was to examine aqueous humor nitric oxide concentration changes in pseudophakic eyes with persistent diffuse diabetic macular edema after intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide, as well as the potential impact of these changes on the intraocular pressure values. In 10 pseudophakic eyes with persistent diffuse diabetic macular edema, paracentesis of anterior chamber with aspiration of aqueous humor and nitric oxide concentration measurements were done on the day of the intravitreal application of 20 mg triamcinolone acetonide, and after 1, 3, 6 and 9 months. Also, we were recording intraocular pressure values before the intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide injection and during the next 9 months. One month after the intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide injection, we noticed a decrease of nitric oxide concentration (45.37±5.55 µmol/L) by 31.79% compared to the initial values (66.52±7.66 µmol/L). After that, nitric oxide concentrations began to rise slightly, and at the end of the ninth month the mean nitric oxide concentration was similar to that recorded at the beginning of the study. Intraocular pressure values had increasing trend one month after the intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide injection (23.70±4.08 mm Hg) compared to the initial values (16.21±1.55 mm Hg), but after nine months these values returned to normal levels.

2023-11-01,37870020,Color perception on Ishihara plates with red lenses in subjects with low vision due to retinal diseases.,"This study aimed to evaluate color perception (CP) changes on Ishihara plates following red-tinted contact lenses in subjects with low vision (LV) from retinal diseases.A cross-sectional observational study without control involved 84 subjects, aged 20-70 years, having LV from retinal diseases to examine CP changes following wearing red-tinted contact lenses. The subjects viewed Ishihara plates, with each eye separately, before and after wearing red lenses in two categories: ""plates 1-21"" and ""plates 22-25"". Change in CP with the use of a red lens was the primary outcome measure.There was a significant increase in the number of plates read in both categories, that is, plates 1-21 (P = 0.002) and plates 22-25 (P = 0.032), the latter being used to diagnose the red-green defects. Although 70 eyes could read both digits on plates 22-25 and appeared to have normal color vision (CV) at baseline, this number rose to 99 eyes following the use of red-tinted lenses. There was a significant change in the type of CP (red defect/green defect/normal/undefined defect) (P = 0.022) with the application of a red-tinted lens.The use of red-tinted lenses caused a significant increase in the number of plates read, increased the number of subjects who appeared normal on plates 22-25, and significantly changed CP of LV subjects. These lenses can be a valuable aid for LV subjects. Although Ishihara plates can diagnose only red-green defects, further studies on CV testing techniques that detect both red-green and blue-yellow CV defects are recommended.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,effectiveness,,retinal disease,4
2023-11-01,37870025,Comparison of prevalent management options to treat acute central serous chorioretinopathy.,"To study the acute central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) management strategies practiced at a tertiary eye care center in eastern India.In a retrospective chart review study, the clinical outcomes of three different management approaches to treating acute CSC were analyzed. Individuals with follow-ups of fewer than 6 months were excluded. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the prognostic markers of CSC resolution.In the 10-year study period (January 2013-July 2022), 206 eyes were included. Placebo treatment was the preferred practice (48.5%; n = 100 eyes). Watchful observation without placebo was the management strategy in 30.6% (n = 63) of the eyes, and 20.9% (n = 43) of eyes received focal lasers. Risk factor modification was attempted in all. There was no significant difference in the resolution rate (P = 0.819), time to resolution (P = 0.331), and disease recurrence (P = 0.067) among the groups. Univariate logistic regression analysis did not favor any of the treatment strategies predicting resolution and recurrence.Alternative treatment modes did not score over the natural history of acute CSC regarding disease resolution, vision gain, and disease recurrence.

2023-11-01,37871593,A Simple Step-by-Step Guide to Permanent Punctal Occlusion with the Ophthalmic Burr and Suture Technique.,"The medical treatment of dry eye disease usually follows a step-wise approach to achieve clinical improvement, ranging from non-surgical interventions with intensive lubrication to permanent surgical punctal occlusion. While frequent lubrication is essential, the intense regime is often too burdensome and difficult to maintain at the required frequency. Punctal plugs are an invaluable alternative approach, but also have limitations, especially in conscious children, in whom inserting and re-inserting punctum plugs in clinic can be challenging. If a patient has permanent and severe dry eye disease and responded well to a trial of temporary punctal plugging, a permanent surgical solution should be considered next. Liu et al showed that a more successful, yet simple technique to achieve permanent occlusion is to combine de-epithelialising the punctum and ampulla with the immediate firm apposition of the de-epithelialised surface using a self-absorbable suture - with a success rate of 92% in a prospective study. This article demonstrates this technique step-by-step in an 8-year-old child with severe chronic dry eye disease following proton beam therapy for orbital rhabdomyosarcoma.

Optic disk pit maculopathy causes progressive visual deterioration and is addressed with pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with or without ODP stuffing.We report a case of progressive ODP maculopathy who was taken up for 23-G 3-port PPV, with complete vitreous removal and stuffing of the ODP with autologous sclera and sequential analysis of change in the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness.Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography RNFL analysis at 1 and 12 months follow-up postoperatively showed total RNFL thickness decrease from 130 µm to 103 µm respectively. Hemiquadrant analysis showed slight reduction of superior RNFL thickness from 142 µm to 139 µm. However, in the inferior hemiquadrant, the reduction in mean RNFL thickness seems to be significant from 133 µm to 100 µm at 1 and 12 months respectively. Sector-wise analysis of the RNFL thickness showed maximum reduction in the inferotemporal quadrant and other sectors seemed to be relatively preserved corresponding to the area of scleral stuffing.Retrospective or prospective analysis of RNFL health of patients undergoing surgery for ODP-M with stuffing needs to evaluated.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,retinal disease,4

One potential factor is the impact of pulmonary dysfunction on systemic microvascular injury. We assessed the associations between spirometric impairments and systemic microvascular complications in T2D.Cross-sectional study.National Diabetes Management and Research Centre in Ghana.The study included 464 Ghanaians aged ≥35 years with established diagnosis of T2D without primary myocardial disease or previous/current heart failure. Participants were excluded if they had primary lung disease including asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.The associations of spirometric measures (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV1/FVC ratio) with microvascular complications (nephropathy (albumin-creatinine ratio ≥3 mg/g), neuropathy (vibration perception threshold ≥25 V and/or Diabetic Neuropathy Symptom score >1) and retinopathy (based on retinal photography)) were assessed using multivariable logistic regression models with adjustments for age, sex, diabetes duration, glycated haemoglobin concentration, suboptimal blood pressure control, smoking pack years and body mass index.In age and sex-adjusted models, lower Z-score FEV1 was associated with higher odds of nephropathy (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.19-2.02, p=0.001) and neuropathy (1.27 (1.01-1.65), 0.038) but not retinopathy (1.22 (0.87-1.70), 0.246). Similar observations were made for the associations of lower Z-score FVC with nephropathy (1.54 (1.19-2.01), 0.001), neuropathy (1.25 (1.01-1.54), 0.037) and retinopathy (1.19 (0.85-1.68), 0.318). In the fully adjusted model, the associations remained significant for only lower Z-score FEV1 with nephropathy (1.43 (1.09-1.87), 0.011) and neuropathy (1.34 (1.04-1.73), 0.024) and for lower Z-score FVC with nephropathy (1.45 (1.11-1.91), 0.007) and neuropathy (1.32 (1.03-1.69), 0.029). Lower Z-score FEV1/FVC ratio was not significantly associated with microvascular complications in age and sex and fully adjusted models.Our study shows positive but varying strengths of associations between pulmonary dysfunction and microvascular complications in different circulations.

2023-11-01,37904247,Efficacy and safety of allogeneic umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells for the treatment of complex perianal fistula in Crohn's disease: a pilot study.,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of allogeneic umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (TH-SC01) for complex perianal fistula in patients with Crohn's disease (CD).This was an open-label, single-arm clinical trial conducted at Jinling Hospital. Adult patients with complex treatment-refractory CD perianal fistulas (pfCD) were enrolled and received a single intralesional injection of 120 million TH-SC01 cells. Combined remission was defined as an absence of suppuration through an external orifice, complete re-epithelization, and absence of collections larger than 2 cm measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 24 weeks after cell administration.A total of 10 patients were enrolled. Six patients (60.0%) achieved combined remission at 24 weeks. The number of draining fistulas decreased in 9 (90.0%) and 7 (70.0%) patients at weeks 12 and 24, respectively. Significant improvement in Perianal Crohn Disease Activity Index, Pelvic MRI-Based Score, Crohn Disease Activity Index, and quality of life score were observed at 24 weeks. No serious adverse events occurred. The probability of remaining recurrence-free was 70% at week 52.The study demonstrated that local injection of TH-SC01 cells might be an effective and safe treatment for complex treatment-refractory pfCD after conventional and/or biological treatments fail (ClinicalTrials.gov ID, NCT04939337).The study was retrospectively registered on www.gov (NCT04939337) on June 25, 2021.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,crohn's disease,4

2023-11-01,37904471,Air tamponade in vitrectomies for primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment caused by superior breaks.,"The effectiveness of filtered air tamponade for superior retinal breaks was well established. This study was performed to compare the treatment efficacy of pars plana vitrectomies (PPV) with filtered air and silicone oil (SO) for patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) caused by superior breaks with no or mild proliferative vitreoretinopathy. Patients of RRD with superior breaks who underwent PPV with filtered air (Group A) and SO (Group S) tamponade were reviewed retrospectively. Age, gender, laterality, lens status, duration of symptoms, macular status, proliferative vitreoretinopathy grade, use of perfluorocarbon liquid, early and late postoperative complications, follow-up duration were acquired. The primary anatomic reattachment after the first surgery and the final rate of successful reattachment was compared as the main outcome. Secondary outcomes were long-term postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), rate of deferred cataract removal, surgical complications and total surgery number. The primary anatomic success rate was 88% (14/16 eyes) in Group A and 100% (16/16 eyes) in group S, which was not significantly different (P = .484). Both groups achieved 100% final anatomic success. The rate of cataract removal was 57.1% and 100% (P = .016), and the duration from first surgery to cataract surgery was 231.38 ± 241.23 and 156.36 ± 110.09 days (P = .428) for group A and group S, respectively. The rate of postoperative epiretinal membrane was 21.4% vs 25.0% (P = 1.000). Postoperative BCVA was associated with preoperative BCVA after multiple linear analysis. The primary and final anatomic success rate for PPV with air tamponade and SO in treating RRD with superior breaks were not statistically different.

The participants were randomly allocated to either a combination with diquafosol sodium 3% and sodium hyaluronate 0.3% group (DQS group, n=40) or a sodium hyaluronate 0.3% group (HA group, n=41). Dry eye disease parameters included tear film break-up time (TBUT), Shirmer I test (SIT), corneal and conjunctival fluorescein staining score (FS score), and Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI); tests were conducted before surgery and at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after surgery.At 1 week after surgery, there were no statistically significant overall differences in DED parameters between the 2 groups. At postoperative month 1, the FS score was significantly lower in the DQS group than in the HA group (1.20±1.06 vs. 1.83±1.41 respectively, p=0.026). At 3 months after the surgery, the DQS group was significantly superior to the HA group in OSDI (12.98±7.29 vs. 16.82±8.25, p=0.029), TBUT (5.83±2.02 vs. 4.24±0.94, p=0.0002), and SIT (7.75±3.92 vs. 5.24±3.42, p=0.003).Our study showed that combination therapy with diquafosol and hyaluronate was beneficial for improving both signs and symptoms of dry eye patients after small incision lenticule extraction.",no,yes,no,human RCT,effectiveness,,dry eye,4
2023-11-02,36722525,Inflammatory bowel disease in the elderly: A focus on disease characteristics and treatment patterns.,"As the population ages, the number of elderly inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients is expected to increase. The clinical features and therapeutic options for young and old patients may differ, as elderly IBD patients are likely to have different comorbidities and disease characteristics. The goal of this study was to examine the clinical aspects and therapeutic choices for elderly Saudi IBD patients.We conducted a retrospective study aimed at describing the demographic, clinical, and management characteristics of IBD in elderly patients (≥60 years) who followed up at King Abdulaziz University Hospital (KAUH), Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The data was extracted from the KAUH inflammatory bowel disease information system (IBDIS) registry. The primary outcome was to describe disease characteristics in accordance with the Montréal classification and the secondary outcomes were to describe treatment patterns and identify significant clinical associations.Our data were collected from 76 patients who fulfilled the study inclusion criteria. Females outnumbered males (53.9% vs 46.1%) and the mean age was 51.5 ± 9.7 years. Essential hypertension (26.3%) was the most common comorbidity followed by diabetes mellitus (23.6%), and malignant neoplasms (9.21%). More than half of the patients with Crohn's disease (CD) had disease onset after forty years of age. The most common form of disease distribution was ileocolonic disease (64.7%). Less than 17% of patients had a penetrating disease phenotype. About 88 percent of patients with UC presented >40 years of age. Approximately, half of the cohort had left-sided ulcerative colitis (UC) (48%), followed by pancolitis (40%). The most prescribed medication class for IBD was 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) derivatives (56.58%) followed by corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs.In Saudi Arabia, age-specific concerns including comorbidities and polypharmacy remain the major challenges in the management of elderly IBD patients.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",4

We aimed to assess feasibility, safety and clinical outcome when switching from intravenous (IV) to SC VDZ maintenance treatment in a real world cohort of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) followed by therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM).Eligible IBD patients were switched from IV to SC treatment and assessed six months prior to switch, at baseline and six, twelve and twenty-six weeks after switch. Primary outcome was proportion of patients on SC treatment after 26 weeks. Secondary outcomes included adverse events (AEs), clinical disease activity, biochemical markers, treatment interval, serum-VDZ (s-VDZ), preferred route of administration and health-related quality of life.In total, 108 patients were switched. After 26 weeks, 100 patients (92.6%) were still on SC treatment and median s-VDZ was 47.6 mg/L (IQR 41.3 - 54.6). The most frequent AE was injection site reaction (ISR), reported by 20 patients (18.5%). There were no clinically significant changes in disease activity, biochemical markers and quality of life. The proportion of patients preferring SC administration increased from 28.0% before switch to 59.4% after 26 weeks (p < 0.001).Nine out of ten patients still received SC treatment after 26 weeks. No change in disease activity occurred, and levels of serum VDZ increased. Although almost one fifth of patients experienced ISRs, a higher proportion favored SC administration at 26 weeks.

We aimed to assess the effect of CYP genotypes on safety and efficacy, and make a direct comparison with systemic corticosteroids.We enrolled UC patients receiving budesonide-MMX and IBD patients on methylprednisolone in our prospective, observational-cohort study. Before and after treatment regimen clinical activity indexes, laboratory parameters (electrolytes, CRP, cholesterol, triglyceride, dehydroepiandrosterone, cortisol, beta-crosslaps, osteocalcin), and body composition measurements were assessed. CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 genotypes were determined in the budesonide-MMX group.71 participants were enrolled (budesonide-MMX: 52; methylprednisolone: 19). CAI decreased (p<0.05) in both groups. Cortisol decreased (p<0.001), and the level of cholesterol was elevated in both groups (p<0.001). Body composition altered only following methylprednisolone. Bone homeostasis (osteocalcin; p<0.05) and DHEA (p<0.001) changed more prominently after methylprednisolone. Glucocorticoid-related adverse events were more common following methylprednisolone treatment (47.4% compared to 1.9%). CYP3A5(*1/*3) genotype positively influenced efficacy, but not safety. Only one patient's CYP3A4 genotype differed.CYP genotypes can affect the efficacy of budesonide-MMX; however, further studies would be needed with analyses of gene expression.

However, few studies have examined the long-term efficacy and its predictors. This study aimed to assess the clinical factors affecting the long-term efficacy of FMT for patients with UC.This is a retrospective analysis of a prospective trial (NCT01790061) for patients with UC undergoing washed microbiota transplantation (WMT), which is the improved methodology of FMT. The long-term clinical efficacy of WMT and the factors affecting efficacy were analyzed.A total of 259 patients were included for analysis. Of 70.7% (183/259) of patients achieved a clinical response at 1 month after WMT and 29.7% (77/259) achieved steroid-free clinical remission 6 months after WMT. Total 44 patients maintained a clinical response for ≥24 months, and 33 (17.1%, 33/193) achieved steroid-free clinical remission for ≥24 months with WMT monotherapy. Patients with age at UC onset of ≥60 years, mild disease severity and undergoing ≥2 courses of WMT during the response within 6 months were more likely to achieve steroid-free clinical remission 6 months after WMT. Besides, independent factors associated with the long-term response of WMT for UC were age at onset of ≥60 years and ≥2 courses of WMT during the response.This study indicated WMT could induce short-term steroid-free clinical remission and maintain long-term response in UC, especially for older patients and patients undergoing sequential courses.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,effectiveness,,ulcerative colitis,4

A smartphone (iPhone 6S, Apple) and custom-made software were used to record the eyelid movements for 3 minutes in a standardized manner. Optical coherence tomography of the tear meniscus was used to assess the tear meniscus area. Tear break-up time and the Ocular Surface Disease Index questionnaire were also evaluated. Patients were assessed before and 15 days after botulinum toxin injections.Forty eyes of 20 patients were evaluated. The frequency of the spontaneous eyelid movements was significantly reduced after treatment (23.18 ± 12.85 movements/min vs. 9.29 ± 6.87 movements/min; p < 0.0001). Significant increases in the tear meniscus area (0.020 ± 0.015 mm 2 vs. 0.057 ± 0.104 mm 2 ; p = 0.01) and in break-up time (4.2 ± 1.2 seconds vs. 5.1 ± 1.3 seconds; p = 0.03) were observed 15 days after treatment. A significant reduction in the Ocular Surface Disease Index (59.05 ± 19.04 vs. 21.2 ± 19.5; p < 0.0001) was also observed.Significant changes in the tear meniscus area, break-up time, and Ocular Surface Disease Index after treatment reflect the effect of botulinum toxin on the lacrimal pump and in the improvement of dry eye symptoms. Reduction of eyelid spasms after treatment in blepharospasm patients was demonstrated using a smartphone and custom-made software.

All records from patients with a minimum of 6 months of follow-up and at least 2 good-quality Spectralis SD-OCT macula scans were included. Linear mixed models were used to investigate the relationship between average IOP during follow-up and rates of GCL and GCIPL thickness change over time.The effect of IOP on the rates of GCL and GCIPL thickness loss measured by SD-OCT.Eyes had a mean follow-up of 1.8 ± 1.3 years, ranging from 0.5 to 10.2 years. The average rate of change for GCL thickness was -0.220 μm/year (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.268 to -0.172 μm/year) and for GCIPL thickness was -0.231 μm/year (95% CI, -0.302 to -0.160 μm/year). Each 1-mmHg higher mean IOP during follow-up was associated with an additional loss of -0.021 μm/year of GCL thickness (P = 0.001) and -0.032 μm/year of GCIPL thickness (P = 0.001) after adjusting for potentially confounding factors, such as baseline age, disease severity, sex, race, central corneal thickness, and follow-up time.Higher IOP was significantly associated with faster rates of GCL and GCIPL loss over time measured by SD-OCT, even during relatively short follow-up times. These findings support the use of SD-OCT GCL and GCIPL thickness measurements as structural biomarkers for the evaluation of the efficacy of IOP-lowering therapies in slowing down the progression of glaucoma.Proprietary or commercial disclosure may be found in the Footnotes and Disclosures at the end of this article.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"biomarker, effectiveness",,retinopathy,4

Of those, metastatic CD (MCD) is a rare extra-intestinal manifestation for which the management is uncertain.We conducted a retrospective case series of patients with MCD seen at the University hospital Leuven, Belgium, combined with an overview of the recent literature. Electronic medical records were searched from January 2003 till April 2022. For the literature search, Medline, Embase, Trip Database, and The Cochrane Library were searched from inception to April 1, 2022.A total of 11 patients with MCD were retrieved. In all cases noncaseating granulomatous inflammation was found on skin biopsies. Two adults and one child were diagnosed with MCD prior to their diagnosis of CD. Seven patients were treated with steroids (intralesional, topical or systemic). Six patients needed a biological therapy to treat MCD. Surgical excision was performed in three patients. All patients reported a successful outcome and most cases achieved remission. The literature search yielded 53 articles, including three reviews, three systematic reviews, 30 case reports and six case series. A treatment algorithm was generated based on literature and multidisciplinary discussion.MCD remains a rare entity and diagnosis is often difficult. A multidisciplinary approach including skin biopsy is necessary to diagnose and treat MCD efficiently. Outcome is generally favorable, and lesions respond well to steroids and biologicals. We propose a treatment algorithm based on the available evidence and multidisciplinary discussion.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,effectiveness,,crohn's disease,4

In this study, we aimed to determine the rate of their usage among inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients and their association with adherence to conventional therapies.In this cross sectional, survey-based study, IBD patients' (n=226) adherence and compliance were evaluated using the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8. A control sample of 227 patients with other gastrointestinal diseases was included to compare trends of CAM use.Crohn's disease represented 66.4% of those with IBD, with a mean age of 35 ± 13.0 years (54% males). The control group had either chronic viral hepatitis B, gastroesophageal reflux disease, Celiac disease, or other non-IBD diseases, with a mean age of 43.5 ± 16.8 years (55% males). Overall, 49% of patients reported using CAMs (54% in IBD group and 43% in the non-IBD group, P =0.024). Across both groups, the most used CAMs were honey (28%) and Zamzam water (19%). There was no significant association between the severity of the illness and use of CAMs. Patients who used CAMs had a lower adherence to conventional therapies vs. those who did not use CAMs (39% vs. 23%, P =0.038). Using the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8, low adherence to medications was reported in 35% of the IBD group vs. 11% of non-IBD group (P = 0.01).In our population, patients with IBD are more likely to use CAMs and are less adherent to medications. Furthermore, the use of CAMs was associated with a lower adherence rate to conventional therapies. Consequently, further studies assessing the causes associated with the use of CAMs and nonadherence to conventional therapies should be explored and interventions designed to mitigate nonadherence.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",4

This study examined CDI's prevalence, predisposing factors, and clinical outcomes in Saudi hospitalized IBD patients.: A retrospective case-control study was conducted at a tertiary medical city in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. All Saudi adult patients with IBD, admitted over the preceding four years were identified from the hospital's database. Eligible patients were divided into those with CDI and those without CDI. Binary logistic regression was used to determine the predisposing factors for CDI among admitted IBD patients.During the study period, 95 patients were admitted with IBD. Crohn's disease (CD) was the predominant type (71.6%), whereas 28.4% of the patients were with ulcerative colitis (UC). Only 16 (16.8%) patients had positive CDI. CDI-positive patients tend to have hypertension and previous use of steroids. Patients with UC tend to have a higher risk of CDI than those with CD. Most patients recovered from the CDI (81.3%) with a median time to CDI clearance of 14 days. Three patients (18.8%) had recurrent CDI; among them, one died.The prevalence of CDI in Saudi IBD patients is similar to that reported elsewhere.

The objective of this hospital-based cohort study was to identify the factors characterizing dengue and those able to early identify dengue severity in the diabetic patient.We retrospectively analysed demographic, clinical and biological parameters at admission in the cohort of patients who consulted at the university hospital between January and June 2019 with confirmed dengue. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted.Of 936 patients, 184 patients (20%) were diabetic. One hundred and eighty-eight patients (20%) developed severe dengue according to the WHO 2009 definition. Diabetic patients were older and had more comorbidities than non-diabetics. In an age-adjusted logistic regression model, loss of appetite, altered mental status, high neutrophil to platelet ratios (>14.7), low haematocrit (≤ 38%), upper-range serum creatinine (>100 µmol/l) and high urea to creatinine ratio (>50) were indicative of dengue in the diabetic patient. A modified Poisson regression model identified four key independent harbingers of severe dengue in the diabetic patient: presence of diabetes complications, non-severe bleeding, altered mental status and cough. Among diabetes complications, diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy, but not diabetic nephropathy nor diabetic foot, were associated with severe dengue.At hospital first presentation, dengue in the diabetic patient is characterized by deteriorations in appetite, mental and renal functioning, while severe dengue can be early identified by presence of diabetes complications, dengue-related non-severe haemorrhages, cough, and dengue-related encephalopathy.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinopathy,4

This study aimed to estimate the risk of cancer in patients with UC compared to the general Norwegian population, in a population-based cohort (the IBSEN study), 30 years after diagnosis; and to identify possible risk factors associated with cancer.The IBSEN cohort prospectively included all incident patients between 1990 and 1993. Cancer incidence data were obtained from the Cancer Registry of Norway. The overall and cancer-specific hazard ratios (HR) were modelled using Cox regression. Standardized incidence ratios were estimated compared to the general population.In total, the cohort included 519 patients, and 83 cases were diagnosed with cancer. There was no statistically significant difference in the overall cancer risk (HR = 1.01, 95% CI: [0.79-1.29]) and colorectal cancer risk (HR = 1.37, 95% CI: [0.75-2.47]) between patients and controls. The incidence of biliary tract cancer was higher than expected (SIR = 9.84, 95%CI: [3.19-20.15]), especially when UC patients suffered from primary sclerosing cholangitis. Male UC patients were also more at risk of being diagnosed with hematologic malignancies (HR = 3.48, 95% CI: [1.55-7.82]). Being prescribed thiopurines was associated with a higher risk of cancer (HR = 2.03, 95% CI: [1.02-4.01]).At 30 years after diagnosis, the risk of all cancer in patients with UC was not significantly increased compared with the general population.

Methods: DED patients with corneal fluorescein staining grade (CFS) ≤ 3 on the Oxford scale and Schirmer test score < 10 mm/ 5 min were enrolled for once-daily CsA use in this observational, prospective, one-center study. Efficacy of CE at 30, 60, and 90-day follow-up visit was evaluated using OSDI questionnaire. Both the overall OSDI score and the outcomes for all subscales - ocular symptoms (OS), vision-related function (VRF) and environmental triggers (ET) were considered. Results: Twelve patients (10 women and 2 men), whose baseline OSDI ranged between 27.08 and 70.03 mm (48.2 ± 11.8), were included. Their achieved mean scores for subscales such OS, VRF and ET were 66.6 ± 16.8, 42.2 ± 12.0 and 42.2 ± 12.5, respectively. Statistically significant results were obtained after 30 days for OSDI (45.5 ± 10.0; p=0.011), whereas after 90 days for both OSDI (35.4 ± 7.4; p=0.003) and OS (47.2 ± 10.9; p=0.005), VRF (30.5 ± 6.1; p=0.003) and ET (33.3 ± 11.2; p=0.008).

2023-11-02,37522019,Dynamics of the association between visual and auditory functional changes in glaucoma. Preliminary results.,"Glaucoma is a multifactorial degenerative optic neuropathy characterized by the irreversible loss of retinal ganglion cells. Vascular, genetic, anatomical and immune factors are present in etiopathogenic mechanisms. Being the second cause of blindness worldwide after cataract, and with an irreversible character, glaucoma has turned into a disease with a significant impact on public health. Patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) may have central neurodegenerative changes, such as sensorineural hearing loss and static changes. Aim: The aim of this study was to estimate the connections between visual and auditory functional changes in glaucoma. The subjects were grouped as follows: patients with glaucoma compared with patients without glaucoma, while trying to identify the functional defect of the optic nerve (visual field) and a hearing testing (audiogram). Materials and methods: The prospective, cross-sectional study included 32 eyes of 16 subjects with POAG in a group of study and 24 eyes of 12 healthy subjects in the other group, with a mean age of both groups between 61,64 ± 6,53 years old. Both groups were examined from ophthalmological, audiological and radioimaging perspectives with Pure-tone audiometry (PTA) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for brain. All patients had ophthalmologic assessments according to a standardized protocol. Moreover, auditory functional parameters (audiometry) were recorded. Results: Female cases, over 65 years old, with residency in a city, predominated in the group of study. Compared to the control group, patients in the group of study had average levels of the PTA and modified visual field (VF) parameters. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the correlation of PTA was indirect, reduced in intensity, both with MD (r = -0.108; p = 0.585), Cal HOV (r = -0.268; p = 0.168) and the slope profile of the right eye. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that there was a correlation of the right PTA, which was indirect, reduced in intensity, both with MD (r = -0.108; p = 0.585), Cal HOV (r = -0.268; p = 0.168) and the slope profile of the right eye. The left ear PTA correlation was indirect, moderate in intensity, statistically significant with both MD (r = -0.584; p = 0.001) and slope profile (r = -0.377; p = 0.048) and reduced as intensity with Cal HOV (r = -0.147; p = 0.456) of the left eye. Conclusions: Patients with POAG showed changes in audiometry in connection with ophthalmological parameters, a fact suggesting that the auditory system might have been affected in POAG. This study highlighted the interdisciplinarity of the medical field with the aim of ensuring the quality of life of glaucoma patients. A good collaboration between the ophthalmologist and the otolaryngologist was very important for our patients.

Method: The study involved 10 patients diagnosed with breast cancer, who received docetaxel as treatment (study group), and 10 breast cancer patients receiving other chemotherapy treatment (control group). The study was a prospective, controlled and comparative. We mainly analyzed two very important indicators, non-invasive tear film breaking time (NKBUT) and meibography. Results: A decrease and/ or narrowing of Meibomian glands in the study group (breast cancer patients treated with docetaxel) was observed on the meibography. Also, a decrease of the NKBUT was observed in the study group. The average variation of NKBUT in docetaxel patients (22%) and the average variation of meiboscopy in docetaxel patients (33%) showed the effect of docetaxel over time compared to patients who received other anticancer therapy, in whom the mean variation was very small, natural. Conclusions: The action of docetaxel at the level of the two studied indicators (NKBUT and Meiboscopy) was noteworthy at the level of the study group, the changes observed in the Meibomian glands being reversible.

We aimed to identify risk factors for intolerance of oral 5-ASA preparations in pediatric UC.Patients with childhood-onset UC who were seen at our hospital between November 2003 and March 2020 were investigated. Intolerance of 5-ASA was defined as having clinical symptoms (pyrexia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stool) that worsened after starting oral administration of 5-ASA and improved after discontinuation of 5-ASA. Patient sex, age, body size, laboratory data, pediatric UC activity index scores, and colonoscopy-based determinations of the extent and severity of the affected lesion at initiation of 5-ASA of intolerant and tolerant groups were compared.Fifteen patients were in the intolerant group, and 37 were in the tolerant group. The leukocyte count, C-reactive protein level, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were significantly higher in the intolerant group than the tolerant group; the albumin level in the intolerant group was significantly lower. All intolerant patients and 68% of tolerant patients had pancolitis (Paris classification E4). Patients with a large, affected area (Paris classifications E3 and E4) more frequently had intolerance to 5-ASA than patients with a small lesion.

Its use has been limited mainly to the western world. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of IBD-related disability and evaluate the associated risk factors in Saudi Arabia.In this cross sectional study conducted at a tertiary referral center for IBD, the English IBD disk was translated into Arabic, and patients with IBD were approached to complete it. Total IBD disk score (0 = no disability; 100 = severe disability) was documented and a score of >40 was set as a threshold to estimate the prevalence of disability.Eighty patients with a mean age of 32.5 ± 11.9 years and disease duration of 6 years, including 57% females, were analyzed. The mean IBD-disk total score was 20.70 ± 18.69. The mean subscores for each function within the disk ranged from 0.38 ± 1.69 for sexual functions to 3.61 ± 3.29 for energy. The overall prevalence of IBD-related disability was 19% (15/80 scoring >40) and was much higher in active disease, in males and in IBD of long duration (39%, 24%, and 26%, respectively). A clinically active disease, high CRP, and high calprotectin were strongly associated with higher disk scores.Although the overall mean IBD disk score was low, nearly 19% of our population had high scores signifying a high prevalence of disability.

We also focused on the comparison of anti-VEGF agents for ROP.22 out of 89 babies (14 boys and 8 girls) with aggressive posterior retinopathy of prematurity (APROP) and mean gestational age of 25+3w received initially anti-VEGF injections. 16 of those (11 boys and 5 girls) required retreatment with diode laser. 9 out of these 16 babies were treated with ranibizumab (Lucentis) and 7 with bevacizumab (Avastin). It is also of note that only 2 out of 67 babies who initially received laser treatment needed a complementary laser session.The majority of babies with aggressive ROP who receive anti-VEGF agents will most probably require further laser treatment. At an equal level of retinal damage, it seems that their response to ranibizumab and bevacizumab is similar.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,retinopathy,4
2023-11-02,37805622,Clinical characteristics and management outcomes of acute retinal necrosis.,"This study investigates patient's clinical characteristics and management outcomes of PCR-positive Acute Retinal Necrosis (ARN). The patient's clinical characteristics of the disease, and therapeutic approaches were assessed. Data from the medical records of 40 eyes of 40 patients were analyzed. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) of the age of the patients was 47.8 ± 14.1 years (16-84 years old). The median follow-up time was 160 days, with a range of 120-370 days. The mean ± SD of patients' primary and final BCVA was 1.24 ± 0.78 and 1.08 ± 0.86 LogMAR, respectively. The final BCVA increased significantly after the treatment in the last follow-up period in patients who did not undergo PPV (p = 0.029). Although, vision changes were not statistically significant in patients who underwent PPV (p = 0.549). 75% of our patients had a positive aqueous PCR for VZV, and the second most common causative agents were CMV and HSV (10% for each). Besides, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) occurred in 25% of our patients. Our analysis showed that the presenting visual acuity and RRD occurrence are the significant prognostic factors for final blindness in ARN.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,retinal disease,4
2023-11-02,37833625,Visual acuity assessment of central retinal artery occlusion patients with or without paracentral acute middle maculopathy via OCT-A.,"The association between paracentral acute middle maculopathy (PAMM) and visual acuity in patients with central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is still unclear. The present study investigated the visual acuity of CRAO patients with and without PAMM.CRAO patients with PAMM or without PAMM were included. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) was used to record the macular retinal thickness and density of shallow and deep vessels. The Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was converted to a logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (LogMAR) for statistical analysis.There were 34 CRAO patients with PAMM (43.13%), other 30 CRAO patients without PAMM (46.87%). Compared with the no-PAMM group, PAMM group had better LogMAR BCVA (1.48 (0.49, 1.85) Vs. 1.85 (1.70, 1.96), P < 0.01). There was also a significant difference in retinal thickness of the central macular sulcus (328.00 (304.50-332.25) Vs. 352.50 (311.75-420.50), P = 0.01). A significant correlation between LogMAR BCVA and macular retinal thickness was found (r = 0.42; P < 0.01).CRAO patients with PAMM had significantly better visual acuity and less macular edema.

2023-11-02,37833819,A single-center study of clinical features of pediatric Sjögren's syndrome.,"Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a rare disease with unclear diagnostic criteria among the children and adolescents. The purpose of this study is to describe the clinical features of pediatric Sjögren's syndrome and validate with Japanese diagnostic guidelines criteria of 2018.We conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical data of a cohort of 54 patients with pediatric Sjögren's syndrome admitted to our hospital over a total of 10 years from September 2013 to September 2022.The ratio of females to males was 49:5 among the 54 children (34 cases of primary SS and 20 cases of secondary SS), the average age of onset of symptoms for the first time was 9.9 years, and the average age at diagnosis was 10.2 years. In terms of subjective symptoms, 7 cases (13.0%) presented with dry mouth and 5 cases (9.3%) reported dry eyes. The positive rates were 9.3% for Schirmer I test, 70.4% for salivary gland function test, and 55.6% for salivary gland ultrasonography. The positive rates were 94.4% for Anti-Ro/SSA antibodies, 66.7% for Anti-La/SSB antibodies, 88.9% for ANA, 59.3% for RF, and the elevation rate of IgG was 63.0%. Among the EULAR Sjögren's syndrome disease activity index (ESSDAI) domains, the biological, constitutional, glandular, cutaneous, and lymphadenopathy domains were most involved. Treatment consisted of glucocorticoids in 88.9% of the patients in our study and hydroxychloroquine in 92.6%. As per the Japanese version of the clinical practice guidance for Sjögren's Syndrome in pediatric patients (2018), 5 cases were identified as Definite SS, 35 cases as Probable SS, and 14 cases as Possible SS. With respect to primary and secondary SS, there was essentially no significant difference between the groups in any of the above aspects.Patients with pediatric SS presented with a wide spectrum of clinical features, a low prevalence of reported symptoms of dry mouth and dry eyes, and various clinical manifestations with multi-system involvement. These are similar to other pediatric study cohorts in terms of epidemiology, auxiliary investigation results, disease activity scores, and treatment. The coincidence between our study and the Japanese version of the clinical practice guidance for Sjögren's Syndrome in pediatric patients (2018) is good for the diagnosis of pediatric SS.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,dry eye,4
2023-11-02,37851564,An Artificial Intelligence System for Screening and Recommending the Treatment Modalities for Retinopathy of Prematurity.,"The purpose of this study was to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) system for the identification of disease status and recommending treatment modalities for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).This retrospective cohort study included a total of 24,495 RetCam images from 1075 eyes of 651 preterm infants who received RetCam examination at the Shenzhen Eye Hospital in Shenzhen, China, from January 2003 to August 2021. Three tasks included ROP identification, severe ROP identification, and treatment modalities identification (retinal laser photocoagulation or intravitreal injections). The AI system was developed to identify the 3 tasks, especially the treatment modalities of ROP. The performance between the AI system and ophthalmologists was compared using extra 200 RetCam images.The AI system exhibited favorable performance in the 3 tasks, including ROP identification [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), 0.9531], severe ROP identification (AUC, 0.9132), and treatment modalities identification with laser photocoagulation or intravitreal injections (AUC, 0.9360). The AI system achieved an accuracy of 0.8627, a sensitivity of 0.7059, and a specificity of 0.9412 for identifying the treatment modalities of ROP. External validation results confirmed the good performance of the AI system with an accuracy of 92.0% in all 3 tasks, which was better than 4 experienced ophthalmologists who scored 56%, 65%, 71%, and 76%, respectively.The described AI system achieved promising outcomes in the automated identification of ROP severity and treatment modalities.

This study evaluated the current use of preoperative screening and prehabilitation strategies (PS) prior to elective ileocolic resection (ICR) in patients with Crohn's disease (CD).Patients with CD who underwent an elective ICR were identified from a Dutch prospective cohort study. Primary endpoint was to evaluate to what extent IBD-relevant PS were applied in patients with CD prior to ICR according to the current recommendations.In total, 109 CD patients were included. Screening of nutritional status was performed in 56% of the patients and revealed malnutrition in 46% of these patients. Of the malnourished patients, 46% was referred to a dietitian. Active smoking and alcohol consumption were reported in 20% and 28%; none of these patients were referred for a cessation program. A preoperative anemia was diagnosed in 61%, and ferritin levels were assessed in 26% of these patients. Iron therapy was started in 25% of the patients with an iron deficiency anemia. Exposure to corticosteroids at time of ICR was reported in 29% and weaned off in 3%. Consultation of a dietitian, psychologist, and physiotherapist was reported in 36%, 7%, and 3%. Physical fitness was assessed in none of the patients.PS are not routinely applied and not individually tailored in the preoperative setting prior to elective ICR in patients with CD.

Patients with preexisting ERM who underwent cataract surgery with implantation of monofocal IOL with enhanced intermediate function were included retrospectively. According to the ERM grade and central subfield thickness (CST) obtained from preoperative optical coherence tomography, patients were divided into non-fovea-involving and fovea-involving ERM groups. At 1 month after surgery, uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), uncorrected intermediate visual acuity (UIVA), uncorrected near visual acuity (UNVA), contrast sensitivity, defocus curve, and satisfaction questionnaire were evaluated. Postoperative clinical findings were compared with age-matched controls without ERM. A total of 50 patients' eyes (28 and 22 in the non-fovea-involving and fovea-involving ERM groups, respectively) were compared with 42 control eyes. One month post-surgery, significant differences in UDVA, CDVA, and CST (corrected P was < 0.001, = 0.001, and < 0.001, respectively) were observed between the fovea-involving ERM and control group; however, no significant differences in UIVA and UNVA were observed between the two groups. Contrast sensitivity showed inferior results in the fovea-involving group without significance. Photic phenomena were reported less in the fovea-involving group than in the non-fovea-involving group. More than 70% of patients in both ERM groups were satisfied.

The chart review specifically searched for infants treated for zone 2 stage 3 ROP with plus disease, where additional posterior to the ridge laser was performed.Seventy-eight eyes of 45 infants met the inclusion criterion. The mean birth weight and gestational age were 1166.09 ± 329.66 gm and 29 ± 2 weeks, respectively. Group 1 comprised 52 eyes treated for high-risk prethreshold stage 3 ROP, while group 2 comprised 26 eyes treated for threshold ROP. 532-nm frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser (Nidek, Japan) was used in all eyes. Apart from the standard laser to the avascular retina, an additional three rows of laser were applied posterior to the ridge in all eyes during the primary laser sitting (except in two eyes where it was performed as a rescue treatment 2 weeks after the first sitting). No complications were observed during or immediately after the laser procedure. A favorable outcome was achieved in 98.07% of eyes with prethreshold ROP and 76.92% of eyes with threshold ROP. Overall, a favorable outcome was achieved in 71 (91.02%) of the 78 eyes.Posterior to the ridge laser performed in the primary sitting along with the standard laser for treatable stage 3 ROP in zone 2 is safe and effective.

2023-11-02,37870022,Surgical and visual outcomes after vitreoretinal surgery for complex retinal capillary hemangioblastoma.,"We evaluated the anatomical and functional outcomes after vitreoretinal surgery for complex retinal capillary hemangioblastoma (RCH).This was a retrospective case series of 15 patients (16 eyes) with tractional or combined retinal detachment (RD) managed with pars plana vitrectomy and tumor endoresection (ER) with/without feeder vessel ligation.The mean age at the time of surgery was 30 years (range, 14-46 years). The most common tumor locations were inferotemporal (six eyes) and temporal (six eyes) quadrants. Indications for surgery included exudative RD with fibrovascular proliferation (eight eyes), combined RD (five eyes), vitreous hemorrhage (four eyes), and rhegmatogenous RD (two eyes). Tumor destruction was performed with laser and/or cryotherapy in nine eyes (57%) and ER in seven eyes (43%). Feeder vessel was ligated and cauterized in 10 (63%) and six eyes (37%), respectively. Anatomical success after initial surgery was 50% (eight eyes), which improved to 88% (14 eyes) after they underwent a repeat procedure for recurrent RD (eight eyes). At the last visit, visual acuity improved in seven eyes (44%), was stable in four eyes (25%), and worsened in five eyes (31%) with a mean follow-up of 29 months (6-79 months). Comparison between the ER group and the laser/cryotherapy group revealed no significant difference in final retinal reattachment rate (89% vs. 86%, P > 0.05), with better visual outcomes in laser/cryotherapy group (57% vs. 78%, P < 0.05).Pars plana vitrectomy with/without tumor endoresection can be a safe and effective treatment option for complex RCHs, achieving good tumor control and anatomical success with limited functional success.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,retinal disease,4
2023-11-02,37876508,Baseline characteristics and progression of neovascular age-related macular degeneration in patients receiving over 60 intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor.,"Objective: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision loss in older populations of industrialized countries. Antibody-based therapy inhibiting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been very successful in the treatment of the neovascular form of AMD. This retrospective clinical study investigates the baseline characteristics and progression of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) in patients who received over 60 anti-VEGF intravitreal injections. Methods: Retrospective analysis of 6812 eyes of 5678 patients undergoing anti-VEGF treatment at our clinic between November 2006 and December 2017 yielded 12 eyes of 12 patients who had received more than 60 intravitreal injections into one eye. We re-evaluated the baseline characteristics of visual acuity, intraocular pressure, optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography, as well as autofluorescence and analyzed the documented disease progress as monitored in our daily clinical practice. Data on the fellow eye were also analyzed. Results: Each of our 12 patients had the injected anti-VEGF agent (bevacizumab, ranibizumab, or aflibercept) changed at least once during treatment. After initial improvement, visual acuity decreased in most patients over time. The 2 patients with the best visual acuity at the beginning also showed the best visual acuity at the end of the study. No significant change was observed in the intraocular pressure. Conclusions: After the initial improvement, visual acuity decreased over time. Good visual acuity at the beginning of the study increased the chances of maintaining the same level throughout the treatment. Intravitreal treatment did not affect intraocular pressure.

2023-11-02,37876512,Predictors of visual outcome after pars plana vitrectomy secondary to proliferative diabetic retinopathy.,"Objective: Advanced proliferative diabetic retinopathy can lead to serious ophthalmological complications, including blindness. This research aimed to determine visual outcomes after pars plana vitrectomy secondary to proliferative diabetic retinopathy, as well as to identify its predictors. Methods: This prospective clinical study was performed in the Ophthalmology Clinic of the Clinical Centre University of Sarajevo. 60 subjects (eyes) with performed pars plana vitrectomy secondary to proliferative diabetic retinopathy were included in the study. Results: After univariate linear regression analysis, glucose, HbA1c, vascular endothelial growth factor, previous pan-retinal laser photocoagulation, baseline best corrected visual acuity, gas injection, vitreous haemorrhage, iris rubeosis, and glaucoma were found to be statistically significant parameters associated with postoperative visual outcome (p<0.05). Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between factors and postoperative best corrected visual acuity. Only intravitreal vascular endothelial growth factor concentration, previous pan-retinal photocoagulation, and gas injection remained statistically significant associated with postoperative best corrected visual acuity (p<0.05). Conclusion: Vitrectomy is an effective treatment for advanced proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Factors correlated with the better visual outcome are good systemic control, previous pan-retinal photocoagulation, low intravitreal vascular endothelial growth factor concentration, younger age, intraoperative internal gas tamponade, combined phacoemulsification and pars plana vitrectomy surgery, and the absence of postoperative complications.

2023-11-02,37876516,Macular dynamics and visual acuity prognosis in retinal vein occlusions - ways to connect.,"Background and Objectives: This study aimed to establish possible connections between macular dynamics, various macular features, and visual acuity prognosis among patients with retinal vein occlusions. Materials and Methods: This study included 85 patients with central retinal vein occlusions (CRVO) and 26 with branch retinal vein occlusions (BRVO). We assessed macular features such as central macular thickness (CMT), foveal intraretinal hemorrhage (IRH), the presence and distribution of hyperreflective foci (HF), ellipsoid zone (EZ) disruption, inner retinal layer disorganization (DRIL), and posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), as well as their dynamics over one year of observation and their impact on final visual acuity prognosis, depending on the type of occlusion. Results: Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) evolution is statistically significant regarding groups of age and type of occlusion and insignificant regarding gender. The best response to intravitreal treatment, quantified as a decrease in CMT, was registered after the first intravitreal injection. Connecting a decrease in CMT with BCVA improvement, we did not register a statistically significant correlation in the CRVO group, only in BRVO cases. The study results showed that complete PVD plays a significant positive role in decreasing CMT and BCVA improvement in cases of CRVO. Our study revealed that no matter the type of occlusion, the presence of foveal IRH will have a negative impact on the BCVA outcome. Statistically significant differences have been noted only for the evolution of visual acuity in non-ischemic CRVO cases, in correlation with the presence of EZ disruption. Outer retinal layer HF has proved to be a predictive factor for poor visual acuity outcomes. Conclusions: The most important non-imaging predicting factors regarding BCVA after retinal vein occlusions are age and baseline BCVA. CMT's dynamics still establish a weak connection with visual acuity fluctuations. The presence of foveal IRH, outer retinal layer HF, and foveal EZ disruption has a negative impact on visual acuity outcomes.

2023-11-02,37903818,Assessment of the eye surface and subjective symptoms after using 0.1% dexamethasone drops with and without preservatives in patients after cataract surgery.,"Cataract surgery can cause dry eye symptoms. One of the many factors compromising the ocular surface is the use of benzalkonium chloride (BAC)-preserved topical eye drops administered during the postoperative period. In this open-label, prospective, randomized, comparative clinical trial, 40 patients not previously affected by dry eye disease were assigned to receive either preservative-free (PFD) or preserved (PD) dexamethasone 0.1% eye drops for two weeks after a standard phacoemulsification procedure. Fluorescein break-up time, ocular surface staining score, Schirmer test, Ocular Surface Disease Index and anterior chamber (AC) cells were evaluated at baseline prior to the surgery and 2 weeks after surgery. No statistically significant differences in baseline assessments were observed between groups. At week 2, a significant increase in corneal staining scores (p = 0.003) and foreign body sensation (p = 0.04) was observed for the PD group only. The conjunctival staining score was significantly higher in both groups. The mean AC cell grading was higher in the PFD group than in the PD group (0.28 ± 0.30 and 0.07 ± 0.18, respectively; p = 0.013). Preservative-free dexamethasone eye drops after cataract surgery caused milder dry eye symptoms as compared with preserved dexamethasone.

2023-11-02,37907703,Machine learning regression algorithms to predict short-term efficacy after anti-VEGF treatment in diabetic macular edema based on real-world data.,"The objective of this retrospective study was to predict short-term efficacy of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment in diabetic macular edema (DME) using machine learning regression models. Real-world data from 279 DME patients who received anti-VEGF treatment at Ineye Hospital of Chengdu University of TCM between April 2017 and November 2022 were analyzed. Eight machine learning regression models were established to predict four clinical efficacy indicators. The accuracy of the models was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE) and coefficient of determination score (R2). Multilayer perceptron had the highest R2 and lowest MAE among all models. Regression tree and lasso regression had similar R2, with lasso having lower MAE and MSE. Ridge regression, linear regression, support vector machines and polynomial regression had lower R2 and higher MAE. Support vector machine had the lowest MSE, while polynomial regression had the highest MSE. Stochastic gradient descent had the lowest R2 and high MAE and MSE. The results indicate that machine learning regression algorithms are valuable and effective in predicting short-term efficacy in DME patients through anti-VEGF treatment, and the lasso regression is the most effective ML algorithm for developing predictive regression models.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,effectiveness,,retinopathy,4

Laparoscopic TPC was performed in 10 patients. TPC consisted of two procedures: ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IAA) and TPC with end ileostomy. Using the da Vinci Xi platform with six ports, robotic TPC and abdominal perineal resection (APR) were performed in two and one patients, respectively. Transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) was performed using the perineal approach in five patients.UC-CRC was located in the transverse colon, sigmoid colon, rectum, and anal canal in 1, 1, 10, and 1 patients, respectively. IAA, TPC with end ileostomy, and APR were performed in nine, three, and one patients, respectively. Postoperative complications included colitis, portal vein thrombosis, and liver dysfunction, without mortality. The pathological stages were 0, I, IIa, IIIb, and IIIc in five, four, one, two, and one patients, respectively. The tumors were completely resected in all cases. Eleven patients with pStages 0, I, and II survived without recurrence; however, two patients with pStage III died of cancer recurrence.This study demonstrated the feasibility of laparoscopic and robotic TPC in patients with UC-CRC.

No evidence-based guidelines exist regarding the balloon diameter or the balloon pressure to be used, with recent studies suggesting the use of a smaller diameter than classically used. We sought to analyze the factors associated with safety and efficacy of EBD in CD strictures, particularly looking at balloon diameter and dilatation pressure.We conducted a monocentric retrospective study of patients who underwent EBD between 2005 and 2020.Our endoscopy department performed EBD in 94 CD patients during the considered period. The mean size of balloon dilatation was 16 mm (±2.5; including 21 patients with balloon <14 mm) and the mean dilatation pressure was 5.3 atm (±1.5). No perforation was observed. Over a median follow-up of 5.6 years, the probability of being operated was 5.4% at 1 year and 10.4% at 3 years. Smaller height (HR = 0.90, p = 0.022) and a higher BMI (HR = 1.23, p = 0.014) were associated with the risk of operation. The probability of being operated or redilated was 30.1% at 1 year and 52.5% at 3 years. No factor was significantly associated with this risk.

We sought to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of ciprofloxacin monotherapy, metronidazole monotherapy, and combination therapy (ciprofloxacin and metronidazole) in the treatment of an initial episode of pouchitis after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis (UC).We performed a retrospective cohort study in TriNetX, a global federated research network of electronic health records. Primary outcomes were failure of initial antibiotic therapy and the development of recurrent pouchitis in the first 12 months after an initial episode of pouchitis. One-to-one propensity score matching was performed for age, sex, race, primary sclerosing cholangitis, nicotine dependence, obesity, and previous exposure to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors between the cohorts.Among 271 patients who developed pouchitis (mean age at ileal pouch-anal anastomosis 35.8 years, male sex 57%) and were treated with ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, or combination therapy, 190 (70%) developed recurrent pouchitis. After propensity score matching, there was no significant difference in the odds of early relapse or nonresponse with ciprofloxacin compared with metronidazole monotherapy (adjusted odds ratio 0.56, 95% confidence interval 0.23-1.34) or when either monotherapy was compared with combination therapy. There was also no significant difference in odds of recurrent pouchitis when comparing patients treated with ciprofloxacin with metronidazole monotherapy (adjusted odds ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.40-1.84) or either monotherapy with combination therapy.In this retrospective cohort study, we demonstrated no significant difference in the real-world effectiveness of ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, or combination therapy for the initial episode of pouchitis.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,effectiveness,,ulcerative colitis,4

Anthropometric measurements of waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), and body fat composition assessment of trunk-to-leg fat ratio (TLFR) were obtained. Outcomes included incident all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and macrovascular and microvascular diseases.In British cohort, participants with central obesity defined by WHR had 27%-54% higher risk of incident all-cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.23-1.64), cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.54 [1.15-2.07]), myocardial infarction (HR = 1.43 [1.15, 1.78]), stroke (HR 1.26 [0.90, 1.75]), heart failure (HR = 1.27 [1.00, 1.61]), diabetic nephropathy (HR 1.33 [1.07, 1.65]), and diabetic retinopathy (DR) (HR = 1.48 [1.12, 1.96]) than those without obesity. Central obesity defined by WC and WHtR was associated with 40%-44% and 23%-98% higher risks of developing diabetic events, respectively. In the Chinese cohort, individuals with abdominal obesity, defined by WC (HR 1.44) or WHtR (HR 1.43) but not by WHR, carried more than 40% higher risk of developing DR than those without it.

However, the effect of smoking on microvascular complications is inconclusive.Study participants were 26,673 diabetic men who received health check-up both in 2003-2004 and 2009, excluding women. Assessing smoking status (never, quitting and current) at 2003-2004 and 2009, changes in smoking status were categorised into 7 groups (never - never, never - quitting, never - current, quitting-quitting, quitting-current, current-quitting and current-current). Smoking amount was categorised into never, light (0-10 pack years), moderate (10-20 pack years), and heavy smoking (>20 pack years) based on 2009 data. They were followed-up until 2013 to identify incident microvascular complications. We calculated the adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) (adjusted HR [95% CI]) for incident microvascular complications according to changes in smoking status and smoking amount.Current-quitting (1.271 [1.050-1.538]), current-current (1.243 [1.070-1.444]) and heavy smoking (1.238 [1.078-1.422]) were associated with an increased risk of overall microvascular complications. The risk of nephropathy increased in current-current smoking (1.429 [1.098-1.860]) and heavy smoking (1.357 [1.061-1.734]). An increased risk of neuropathy was observed in current-quitting smoking (1.360 [1.076-1.719]), current-current smoking (1.237 [1.025-1.492]) and heavy smoking (1.246 [1.048-1.481]).

Primary endpoint: best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) changes from baseline at 1 year, averaged over weeks 48, 52, and 56.Mean BCVA change from baseline at 1 year in the Asian country subgroup was similar between arms: faricimab Q8W (n=50), +10.9 (95% CI: 8.6-13.2); faricimab PTI (n=48) +10.0 (7.7-12.4) letters; aflibercept Q8W (n=46) +9.0 (6.6-11.4) letters. BCVA gains in the non-Asian country subgroup (n=582, 584, 581) were +11.3 (10.5-12.1), +11.2 (10.5-12.0), and +10.7 (9.9-11.5) letters, respectively. At 1 year, 49% of Asian country patients in the faricimab PTI arm achieved Q16W dosing (vs. 52% non-Asian) and 78% achieved ≥Q12W dosing (vs. 72% non-Asian). Anatomic improvementswere generally greater with faricimab versus aflibercept and similar between the Asian and non-Asian country subgroups. Faricimab was well tolerated, with no new safety signals.Vision, durability, anatomic, and safety outcomes were generally similar between the Asian and non-Asian country subgroups, suggesting that global YOSEMITE/RHINE results may be generalized to the Asian population.

2023-11-03,37910244,Assessment of the ileoanal pouch for the colorectal surgeon.,"Many pouch complications following ileoanal pouch surgery have an inflammatory or mechanical nature, and specialist colorectal surgeons are required to assess the anatomy of the ileoanal pouch in multiple settings. In this study, we report our stepwise clinical and endoscopic assessment of the patient with an ileoanal pouch.The most common configuration of the ileoanal pouch is a J-pouch, and the stapled anastomosis is more frequently performed than a handsewn post-mucosectomy. A structured clinical and endoscopic assessment of the ileoanal pouch must provide information on 7 critical areas: anus and perineum, rectal cuff, pouch anal anastomosis, pouch body, blind end of the pouch, pouch inlet and pre-pouch ileum.We have developed a structured pro forma for step-wise assessment of the ileoanal pouch, according to 7 essential areas to be evaluated, biopsied and reported. The structured assessment of the ileoanal pouch in 102 patients allowed reporting of abnormal findings in 63 (61.7%). Strictures were diagnosed in 27 patients (26.4%), 3 pouch inlet strictures, 21 pouch anal anastomosis strictures, and 3 pre-pouch ileum strictures. Chronic, recurrent pouchitis was diagnosed in 9 patients, whilst 1 patient had Crohn's disease of the pouch.Detailed clinical history, assessment of symptoms and multidisciplinary input are all essential for the care of patients with an ileoanal pouch.

Since the nasal cavity directly communicates with the eye and as NGF was previously found to ameliorate the symptoms of dry eye when topically delivered, the aim of this study was to establish whether the HPpSIS might ameliorate ocular dryness and tear film composition.This is an observational self-controlled case study carried out on 16 patients with dry-eye diagnosis, concerning 3-month self-administration of HPpSIS and two serial assessments of the ocular surface and tear film. OSDI questionnaire was used for ocular symptoms of dryness. BUT and Schirmer tests were used for qualitative and quantitative tear film analysis. The lipid composition was also examined. R-studio was employed for the detection of the difference between the pre- and post-analysis.On the basis of the OSDI questionnaire, the study population was divided into severe (61.1%), moderate (5.5%), and mild (16.6%) dry-eye symptoms. OSDI score was significantly reduced after HPpSIS (p<0.05). BUT and TMH values also ameliorated after HPpSIS (p>0.05), although not significantly. The lipid layer improved statistically (p<0.05) and correlated positively with OSDI grading. The variability of presentation in the numerical distribution before and after therapy suggests poor test sensitivity.HPpSIS showed a positive effect in reducing OSDI scores and ameliorating tear film quality.

2023-11-06,34686832,Relationships between retinopathy of prematurity without ophthalmologic intervention and neurodevelopment and vision at 2 years.,"Severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is associated with adverse outcomes. Relationships between milder ROP and outcomes have not been defined. We hypothesized that children with ROP stage ≤3 who did not receive ophthalmologic intervention would have worse motor, cognitive, and language skills and more vision abnormalities than children without ROP.This was a secondary analysis of a randomized trial evaluating the effects of myo-inositol on ROP in the NICHD Neonatal Research Network. Primary outcomes were Bayley Scales of Infant Development composite scores; secondary outcomes included behavioral difficulties and ophthalmologic measures. Outcomes were compared using adjusted linear or modified Poisson models.Of 506 children, 173 (34%) had no ROP, 262 (52%) had ROP stage ≤3 without intervention, and 71 (14%) had ROP with intervention. There was no difference in motor, cognitive, or language scores between children with ROP stage ≤3 without intervention and children without ROP. Children with ROP stage ≤3 without intervention had a higher rate of strabismus compared to children without ROP (p = 0.040).Children with ROP stage ≤3 without intervention did not have adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years' corrected age compared to children without ROP but did have an increased incidence of strabismus.This study addresses a gap in the literature regarding the relationship between milder forms of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) that regress without intervention and neurodevelopment and vision outcomes. Children with a history of ROP stage ≤3 without intervention have similar neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years' corrected age as children born extremely preterm without a history of ROP and better outcomes than children with a history of ROP with ophthalmologic intervention. Counseling about likely neurodevelopment and vision outcomes for children born extremely preterm with a history of ROP may be tailored based on the severity of ROP.ClinicalTrials.gov ID: Inositol to Reduce Retinopathy of Prematurity Trial: NCT01954082.",no,yes,no,human RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,retinopathy,4

We investigated the effect of FGR on ROP in growth-discordant identical twins, thereby controlling for confounding factors.All data of monochorionic (MC) twin pairs with a birth weight discordance ≥20% born in our center between 2010 and 2021 were retrospectively reviewed for the presence of ROP. Potential risk factors for ROP were analyzed. Outcomes were compared between the smaller and larger twin.We included 88 MC twin pairs with growth discordance. In 34% (30/88), both neonates were at risk of ROP. Prevalence of ROP was higher among the smaller twin compared to the larger twin, 30% (9/30) versus 13% (4/30), respectively (OR 2.8, 95% CI: 1.2-6.6). The smaller twin had a longer duration of mechanical ventilation (8 (1-20) versus 2 (1-4) days) and received their first red blood cell transfusion at an earlier postmenstrual age (29.6 (28.1-31.6) versus 30.4 (29.7-32.6) weeks).In this identical twin model, FGR is associated with almost tripled odds of ROP development, suggesting that both unfavorable antenatal growth conditions and adverse neonatal outcomes affect postnatal retinal vascular proliferation.Fetal growth restriction in growth-discordant identical twins is associated with almost tripled odds of developing retinopathy of prematurity in the smaller twin. Since these twins do not only differ in birth weight but also duration of mechanical ventilation and timing of the first red blood cell transfusion, both unfavorable antenatal growth conditions and adverse neonatal outcomes can affect postnatal retinal vascular proliferation. More attention for preventing retinopathy of prematurity is needed in those with fetal growth restriction who received prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen supplementation, or a first red blood cell transfusion <32 weeks postmenstrual age.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,retinopathy,4

Fellow eyes were free of MNV or macular atrophy at baseline, and data were collected on the SE, axial length, and presence of diffuse or patchy chorioretinal atrophy and lacquer cracks.Incidence rate and 2-, 5-, and 10-year cumulative incidences were calculated; hazard ratios (HRs) of second eye involvement were analyzed for potential risk factors using Cox proportional hazard models.Incidence of second eye involvement after onset of myopic MNV in the first eye.We included 88 patients over a period of 13 years with a mean age of 58 ± 15 years, mean axial length of 30 ± 1.7 mm and SE -14 ± 4 D at baseline. Twenty-four fellow eyes (27%) developed a myopic MNV during follow-up. This resulted in an incidence rate of 4.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.9-6.7) per 100 person-years and a cumulative incidence of 8%, 21%, and 38% at 2, 5, and 10 years, respectively. Mean time until MNV development in the fellow eye was 48 ± 37 months. Patients aged < 40 years at the initial presentation had a 3.8 times higher risk of bilateral myopic MNV (HR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.65-8.69; P = 0.002). The presence of lacquer cracks in the second eye seemed to increase risk, but this did not reach statistical significance (HR, 2.25; 95% CI, 0.94-5.39; P = 0.07).Our study of high myopes of European descent shows very similar incidence rates for second eye myopic MNV compared with Asian studies.

Visual Function Questionnaire -25 composite and subscale scores at the time of study enrollment were calculated. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to assess time to event for mortality utilizing univariate and multivariable models, which adjusted for all variables significantly associated with mortality. The measures of association were hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).All-cause mortality statistics were obtained through a collaborative agreement with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. Death rates through October 19, 2022 were compared by demographics and potential confounders.Analysis was completed on a cohort of 876 patients, of which 180 (20.6%) died during the follow-up period. Average follow-up time for this cohort was 52.5 (standard deviation: 26.6) months. In univariate analysis, composite VFQ-25 score and all subscale scores aside from ocular pain were significantly associated with time to mortality. Additionally, age, AMD category, marital status, history of smoking, and multiple chronic comorbid conditions were significantly associated with time to mortality. In multivariable analysis, for each 10-point increase in a patient's VFQ-25 scores for general health and driving, the risk of death decreased with HR of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.80, 0.91; P < 0.0001) and 0.92 (95% CI: 0.87, 0.97; P = 0.005), respectively. Composite and other subscale scores were not significantly associated with mortality after adjusting for confounding variables.This cohort of AMD patients had a 20% rate of death in the 52.5-month average follow-up time. Better general health and ability to drive, as measured by the VFQ-25, were each separately associated with significantly lower risk of death among individuals with AMD.The author(s) have no proprietary or commercial interest in any materials discussed in this article.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,effectiveness,,retinal disease,4

There were no limitations with respect to the number, size, or location of retinal breaks. Exclusion criteria included significant proliferative vitreoretinopathy or previous retinal detachment repair in the index eye, inability to maintain the postoperative posturing requirements or inability to carry out adequate examination of the peripheral retina because of media opacity. Lens status did not impact the decision to offer PnR.Pneumatic retinopexy primary anatomic reattachment rate and postoperative best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 3 months.Eighty patients with a mean age of 80.6 ± 4.6 years were included in this study; 35% (28/80) were phakic and 34% (27/80) presented with a fovea-on RRD. The mean number of breaks in the detached retina was 1.52 ± 1.13, and the mean number of quadrants of detached retina was 2.35 ± 0.93. The primary anatomic reattachment rate at 3 months after PnR was 78.8% (63/80), whereas the remaining 21.2% (17/80) failed PnR and underwent an operating room procedure. There was a statistically significant improvement in logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) BCVA from baseline to 3 months (1.29 ± 0.94 and 0.69 ± 0.67, respectively, P < 0.001). A subgroup analysis that only included patients aged > 80 years was also performed, with a total of 39 patients with a mean age of 84.4 ± 3.5 years.

The multivariate linear regression model was used to determine correlation presented as β coefficient (β) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI).In this cohort of 56 survivors <29 weeks' gestation, urine output within the first 12 h of life and Apgar score at 5 min were positively associated with different domains of ASQ-3 score, however male sex and highest fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) in the first 12 h of life were negatively related with at least one of neurocognitive domains of ASQ-3 at adjusted age of 12 to 18 months. During hospitalization, in addition to the frequency of packed red cell transfusions, the development of severe necrotizing enterocolitis was inversely associated with both neuromotor and neurocognitive skills (gross motor domain: β = -16.93, CI: -32.04, -1.82; fine motor domain: β = -16.42, CI: -28.82, -4.02; problem solving domain: β = -13.14, CI: -24.45, -1.83; all P < 0.05), whereas severe intraventricular hemorrhage had adverse effects on gross motor only (β = -13.04, CI: -24.42, -1.65; P = 0.03). Bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of prematurity were not related with ASQ-3.In this small cohort study of very preterm neonates born at <29 weeks' gestation, risk factors in the early hours of life and neonatal morbidities during hospitalization had differential associative relationships with ASQ-3 at 12-18 months adjusted age.

2023-11-06,37748684,Comparative analysis of the quality of life among different retinal diseases.,"To assess the impact on the quality of life (QoL) among different retinal diseases such as diabetic macular edema (DME), retinal vein occlusion (RVO), pathologic myopia (PM), neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC).A cross-sectional study was carried out in 241 patients, affected by DME (n=44), RVO (n=41), PM (n=34) and nAMD (n=85) receiving intravitreal injections due to the presence of macular edema or choroidal neovascularization. The CSC patients included (n=37) were candidates for laser treatment. The patients included completed the National Eye Visual Functioning Questioning-25 (NEI VFQ-25). Best eye visual acuity (BEVA) was recorded using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale.There were significant differences between subgroups for all the domains, except for the general vision in which all scores among diseases ranged from 40.7 to 45.2 out of 100 (P=.436), despite the difference in BEVA (CSC: 86.3±11.9; RVO: 78.5±15.5, DME: 73.3±15.2, nAMD: 72.9±12.6 and PM: 68.5±18.1 letters respectively; P<.001). The lowest VFQ-25 total score was observed in the PM patients (52.1±20.9), followed by nAMD (55.3±20.8), RVO (65.0±22.3), DME (68.6±21.0) and CSC (70.9±16.2). The DME group reported the worst score for general health (38.9±21.4). Mental health and role difficulties were lowest for PM (48.2±28.8 and 48.2±31.9, P<.007).This study reveals the differences in the QoL among DME, RVO, nAMD, PM and CSC, describing the different repercussions that they can suffer, observing a higher impact in PM and nAMD.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,effectiveness,,retinal disease,4

In this study, we aimed to explore the long-term risk of arrhythmias in patients with IBD.Through a nationwide histopathology cohort, we identified patients with biopsy-confirmed IBD in Sweden during 1969 to 2017, including Crohn's disease (CD: n = 24,954; median age at diagnosis: 38.4 years; female: 52.2%), ulcerative colitis (UC: n = 46,856; 42.1 years; 46.3%), and IBD-unclassified (IBD-U: n = 12,067; 43.8 years; 49.6%), as well as their matched reference individuals and IBD-free full siblings. Outcomes included overall and specific arrhythmias (e.g., atrial fibrillation/flutter, bradyarrhythmias, other supraventricular arrhythmias, and ventricular arrhythmias/cardiac arrest). Flexible parametric survival models estimated hazard ratios (aHR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), after adjustment for birth year, sex, county of residence, calendar year, country of birth, educational attainment, number of healthcare visits, and cardiovascular-related comorbidities. Over a median of approximately 10 years of follow-up, 1,904 (7.6%) patients with CD, 4,154 (8.9%) patients with UC, and 990 (8.2%) patients with IBD-U developed arrhythmias, compared with 6.7%, 7.5%, and 6.0% in reference individuals, respectively. Compared with reference individuals, overall arrhythmias were increased in patients with CD [54.6 versus 46.1 per 10,000 person-years; aHR = 1.15 (95% CI [1.09, 1.21], P < 0.001)], patients with UC [64.7 versus 53.3 per 10,000 person-years; aHR = 1.14 (95% CI [1.10, 1.18], P < 0.001)], and patients with IBD-U [78.1 versus 53.5 per 10,000 person-years; aHR = 1.30 (95% CI [1.20, 1.41], P < 0.001)]. The increased risk persisted 25 years after diagnosis, corresponding to 1 extra arrhythmia case per 80 CD, 58 UC, and 29 IBD-U cases over the same period. Patients with IBD also had a significantly increased risk of specific arrhythmias, except for bradyarrhythmias. Sibling comparison analyses confirmed the main findings. Study limitations include lack of clinical data to define IBD activity, not considering the potential role of IBD medications and disease activity, and the potential residual confounding from unmeasured factors for arrhythmias.In this study, we observed that patients with IBD were at an increased risk of developing arrhythmias. The excess risk persisted even 25 years after IBD diagnosis. Our findings indicate a need for awareness of this excess risk among healthcare professionals.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,safety,,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",4
2023-11-06,37919473,Longitudinal anatomical and visual outcome of macular telangiectasia type 2 in Asian patients.,"Limited information regarding the anatomical and visual prognosis of macular telangiectasia (MacTel) type 2 in the Asian population is currently available. Herein, we conducted a retrospective longitudinal analysis of Japanese patients diagnosed with MacTel type 2. Disease progression was evaluated using the Simple MacTel Classification developed by Chew EY et al. in 2023, and its association with visual changes was analyzed. Sixteen eyes of eight Japanese patients were included in the study, with an average follow-up period of 8.2 ± 3.9 years (range, 2.2-14.0). At the initial visit, 7 (44%) and 5 (31%) eyes were classified as Grade 2 (central ellipsoid zone break) and Grade 3 (noncentral pigment), respectively. The proportion of eyes that progressed by 1 or 2-steps in grade after 1, 3, 5, 8, and 12 years was 0%, 14%, 43%, 70%, and 100%, or 0%, 7%, 7%, 30%, and 75%, respectively. The visual acuity significantly deteriorated during the follow-up period, particularly in the two eyes with full-thickness macular holes (FTMH). Three out of 7 patients exhibited low serum serine concentrations, although no apparent correlation with anatomical or visual outcomes was observed. Overall, this cohort demonstrated chronic disease progression, both anatomically and functionally, in eyes with MacTel type 2, with FTMH potentially associated with greater visual loss.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,effectiveness,,retinal disease,4
2023-11-06,37919665,Choroidal vascular changes in silicone oil-filled eyes after vitrectomy for rhegmatogenous retinal detachments.,"The tamponade of silicone oil (SO) can affect both the structure and blood flow of the retina. However, there are few studies on the effect of SO tamponade on choroidal blood flow. Our study aimed to compare the effects of SO tamponade on the choroidal vascular index (CVI) and choroidal thickness (CT) in patients with unilateral rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) with operated eyes and fellow healthy eyes.We retrospectively collected demographic and clinical data from 36 patients who underwent 23G pars plana vitrectomy and SO tamponade for unilateral complicated RRD. Enhanced depth imaging-optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT) scans were performed both within 1 week before SO removal and at the last follow-up visit after SO removal. Using ImageJ software, images were binarized to segment the total choroidal area, luminal area, and stromal area, respectively. The CVI was calculated as CVI=(luminal area)/(total choroidal area), and CT was also evaluated.During SO tamponade, the CVI and luminal area in operated eyes were significantly lower compared to fellow eyes (57.616 ± 0.030 vs. 60.042 ± 0.019, P < 0.0001; 0.909 [0.694; 1.185] vs. 1.091 [0.785; 1.296], P = 0.007). Even after SO removal, the CVI remained lower in operated eyes than in fellow eyes (59.530 ± 0.018 vs. 60.319 ± 0.020, P = 0.031). Both CVI and luminal area were lower in operated eyes before SO removal than after SO removal (57.616 ± 0.030 vs. 59.530 ± 0.018, P = 0.0003; 0.909 [0.694; 1.185] vs. 0.994 [0.712; 1.348], P = 0.028). The duration of SO tamponade was positively correlated with the difference in CVI between fellow eyes and operated eyes during SO tamponade (P = 0.035). Total choroidal area, stromal area, and CT did not differ significantly between fellow eyes and operated eyes or between pre- and post-SO removal.SO tamponade reduces CVI and decreases choroidal blood circulation in patients with retinal detachments required vitrectomy combined with SO tamponade. The longer the SO tamponade time, the more CVI reduction. In future work, we will aim to reduce these side effects by shortening the duration of silicone oil filling.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,retinal disease,4

The incidence of DED increases with age. Cyclosporine ophthalmic solution 0.09% (CEQUA®; OTX-101), cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion 0.05% (Restasis®; CsA), and lifitegrast ophthalmic solution 5% (Xiidra®; LFT) are anti-inflammatory agents indicated for DED. This analysis compared treatment patterns in patients with DED receiving OTX-101, CsA, or LFT.This real-world, retrospective, longitudinal cohort study utilized Symphony Health Integrated Dataverse claims from July 2019 to June 2021. The dataset included all patients with OTX-101 claims and patients with CsA or LFT claims randomly selected 2:1 to OTX-101. Patients were sorted into 3 cohorts based on index treatment. Index date was that of first treatment claim, and follow-up period was from index date to end of clinical activity or data availability. Time to treatment discontinuation (TTD), probability of discontinuation, and treatment persistence were assessed for OTX-101 vs. CsA, then OTX-101 vs. LFT. Subgroup analysis was performed based on age and prior DED treatment. Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test were used to examine TTD. A logistic model evaluated association between index treatment and discontinuation. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and P-values were reported, with statistically significant associations based on P-values < 0.05.Overall, 7102 patients (OTX-101 n = 1846; CsA n = 2248; LFT n = 3008) were eligible. Median TTD was 354 days for patients receiving OTX-101 vs. 241 days for CsA and 269 days for LFT. Log-rank test indicated TTD was significantly longer for patients on OTX-101 vs. CsA (P = 0.033). Patients on CsA were 35% more likely to discontinue treatment than patients on OTX-101; OTX-101 and LFT groups had similar discontinuation rates. After 360 days, 49.8% of patients receiving OTX-101 remained on treatment vs. 39.4% of patients on CsA (P = 0.036) and 44.0% of patients on LFT (P = 0.854).Patients receiving OTX-101 remained on treatment significantly longer and were significantly less likely to discontinue treatment than patients on CsA. Older patients remained on OTX-101 significantly longer than CsA.

2023-11-06,37921040,Visual impairment and blindness caused by retinal diseases: A nationwide register-based study.,"Retinal disorders cause substantial visual burden globally. Accurate estimates of the vision loss due to retinal diseases are pivotal to inform optimal eye health care planning and allocation of medical resources. The purpose of this study is to describe the proportion of visual impairment and blindness caused by major retinal diseases in China.A nationwide register-based study of vitreoretinal disease covering all 31 provinces (51 treating centres) of mainland China. A total of 28 320 adults diagnosed with retinal diseases were included. Participants underwent standardised ocular examinations, which included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), dilated-fundus assessments, and optical coherence tomography. Visual impairment and blindness are defined using BCVA according to the World Health Organization (WHO) (visual impairment: <20/63-≥20/400; blindness: <20/400) and the United States (visual impairment: <20/40-≥20/200; blindness: <20/200) definitions. The risk factors of vision loss were explored by logistic regression analyses.Based on the WHO definitions, the proportions for unilateral visual impairment and blindness were 46% and 18%, respectively, whereas those for bilateral visual impairment and blindness were 31% and 3.3%, respectively. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) accounts for the largest proportion of patients with visual impairment (unilateral visual impairment: 32%, bilateral visual impairment: 60%) and blindness (unilateral blindness: 35%; bilateral blindness: 64%). Other retinal diseases that contributed significantly to vision loss included age-related macular degeneration, myopic maculopathy, retinal vein occlusion, and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and other macular diseases. Women (bilateral vision loss: P = 0.011), aged patients (unilateral vision loss: 45-64 years: P < 0.001, ≥65 years: P < 0.001; bilateral vision loss: 45-64 years: P = 0.003, ≥65 years: P < 0.001 (reference: 18-44 years)) and those from Midwest China (unilateral and bilateral vision loss: both P < 0.001) were more likely to suffer from vision loss.Retinal disorders cause substantial visual burden among patients with retinal diseases in China.

Homelessness poses both socioeconomic and public health challenges because housing status is a social determinant of health. Given ophthalmic health's importance in daily functioning, we characterized ophthalmic disease and vision-related quality of life (VRQOL) among a population experiencing homelessness in Baltimore, Maryland.Questionnaires, including a Visual Function Index-14 (VF-14) for measuring VRQOL, were administered among patients seeking eye examinations at Health Care for the Homeless (HCH) from October 2018 to March 2020.One hundred sixty-two participants were enrolled in this study. The average age was 53 years. Participants' most common vision concerns were blurry vision (70%) and desire for glasses (52%). Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) measurements revealed significant vision loss (18%, P < 0.001). Physicians mostly diagnosed refractive error (77%), cataracts (36%), glaucoma/glaucoma suspect (25%), and dry eye (24%). Nearly half were referred to additional ophthalmic care (46%). VRQOL trends reflected functional vision categories (P = 0.042 and P = 0.021). The 1:1 VRQOL and BCVA comparison showed correlation (rho = -0.3, P < 0.001). Cronbach's alpha demonstrated VF-14 reliability (alpha = 0.92).We find high ophthalmic disease prevalence within a population experiencing homelessness. Comparison to studies worldwide reveals healthcare disparities despite healthcare system differences, suggesting a need for more targeted solutions. VF-14 is valid and reliable in assessing those experiencing homelessness. Intragroup VRQOL comparisons may reveal subgroup needs. It is imperative that future studies continue monitoring those experiencing homelessness.Validation of VF-14 will allow future studies to utilize this patient-oriented metric within populations experiencing homelessness.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, biomarker",,dry eye,4
2023-11-07,37828117,Protamine as a barrier against the angiogenic effect of insulin: a possible role of apelin.,"Insulin is proved to have angiogenic ability thereby may worsen the diabetic retinopathy (DR) progression. Insulin also triggers the expression of endogenous angiogenic peptide, apelin. Since protamine was introduced as an inhibitor of the apelin receptor, we hypothesized that use of protaminated insulin instead of non-protaminated insulin can decrease the negative role of insulin in progression of DR. Firstly, the incidence of DR was compared among three diabetic patient groups: an oral medication, non-protaminated insulin, and protaminated insulin (PIns). Proliferation and migration rate of HUVECs was measured after insulin, apelin, and protamine exposure. In clinical study, the chance of developing DR was 8.5 and 4.1 times higher in insulin group and PIns groups compared with oral group respectively. Insulin group had a chance of 9.5-folds of non-proliferative DR compared to oral group. However, the difference of non-proliferative DR between PIns and oral group wasn't significant. In-vitro tests showed that concomitant use of insulin and apelin increases viability and migratory potential of HUVECs. However, protamine could reverse this effect. Protamine present in some insulins might show a promising protective role against diabetic retinopathy. Thus, protaminated insulins may be preferable in the treatment of diabetes.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,retinopathy,4

Methods: Clinical data of patients diagnosed with complex PFCD in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University from January 2022 to March 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. After sufficient single intravenous infusion of UST (6 mg/kg) at week 0 and 8, every patient received single subcutaneous injection of UST 90 mg every 8 weeks for maintenance treatment. At week 8, 16, and 22-26, clinical outcomes of anal fistula were evaluated using perianal disease activity index (PDAI), and overall activity of the patients was evaluated using Harvey Bradshaw index (HBI). At week 22-26, Van Assche Index (VAI) was used to evaluate imaging outcome of anal fistula, and simplified endoscopic score of Crohn's disease (SES-CD) was employed to assess intestinal outcome events. The above indexes were compared in the patients before and after UST treatment. PFCD patients were divided into first-line UST treatment group and non first-line UST treatment group according to whether first-line UST treatment was used, the differences in anal fistula response rate and remission rate, intestinal response rate and remission rate as well as overall activity response rate and remission rate were compared between the two groups. Results: A total of 60 PFCD patients were included, including 46 males and 14 females, aged [M (Q1, Q3)] 25.0 (20.8, 30.0) years old. The clinical response rates of anal fistula [41.7% (25/60), 55.0% (33/60) and 63.3% (38/60), respectively, P=0.056] and the clinical remission rates of anal fistula [21.7% (13/60), 31.7% (19/60) and 43.3% (26/60), respectively, P=0.002] gradually increased at week 8, 16, 22-26. The overall activity response rates [53.3% (32/60), 70.0% (42/60), 83.3% (50/60), respectively, P=0.040] and the overall activity response rates [41.7% (25/60), 61.7% (37/60), 75.0% (45/60), respectively, P=0.001] also gradually increased at week 8, 16, 22-26. At week 22-26, the partial response rate and fistula healing rate of anal fistula imaging were 45.0% (27/60) and 38.3% (23/60), respectively. The endoscopic response rate and endoscopic response rate were 73.7% (44/60) and 45.0% (27/60), respectively. The endoscopic response rate of patients receiving first-line UST treatment [23 males and 8 females, aged 22.0 (21.0, 39.0) years] was higher than that of patients receiving non first-line UST treatment[23 males and 6 females, aged 26.5 (20.0, 30.0) years,87.1% vs 58.6%, P=0.013].

2023-11-07,37926993,Upadacitinib as a Rescue Therapy in Acute Severe Ulcerative Colitis: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.,"BACKGROUND Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic immune-mediated disease of the colon. The mainstay of treatment to achieve and maintain remission is 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA). At least 20% of patients with UC experience an acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) flare, requiring aggressive early intervention to prevent complications. The first-line treatment of ASUC is intravenous steroids followed by infliximab or cyclosporin in patients for whom steroids fail. Refractory disease failing medical therapy and warranting surgery is common. Lately, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, such as tofacitinib, filgotinib, and upadacitinib, have been licensed for moderate-to-severe UC in adults. Nevertheless, the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib in ASUC has not yet been established. CASE REPORT We report a case of an 18-year-old woman with 4-year history of severe UC. Both infliximab and adalimumab treatments failed, despite the concurrent use of azathioprine, and she was reliant on steroids. Moreover, tofacitinib failed after 1 year of therapy. She was admitted as a case of ASUC. Flexible sigmoidoscopy confirmed severe pancolitis. Finally, she was treated effectively with oral upadacitinib 45 mg given once daily. She went into full clinical, biochemical, and steroid-free remission in 60 days and endoscopic remission at 180 days. CONCLUSIONS This case report features the potential safety and efficacy of upadacitinib in adults with ASUC.

2023-11-07,37930231,A review of the first anti-evaporative prescription treatment for dry eye disease: perfluorohexyloctane ophthalmic solution.,"Dry eye disease (DED) is one of the most common ocular surface disorders. All DED involves an imbalance between tear production and evaporation. Most cases of DED are driven by excessive evaporation, which is often associated with meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). In evaporative DED, a deficient tear film lipid layer is believed to lead to increased tear evaporation, inflammation, and ocular surface damage. Most prescription treatments for DED address signs and symptoms by targeting tear production and/or inflammation, but they do not address excessive evaporation. Perfluorohexyloctane (PFHO) ophthalmic solution (MIEBO™; Bausch + Lomb) is a water-free, single-ingredient, preservative-free prescription eye drop that directly targets tear evaporation and is approved by the FDA to treat the signs and symptoms of DED. Results from preclinical studies indicate that PFHO has a high oxygen carrying capacity, may reduce friction on blinking, and spreads quickly over the tear film surface to form a monolayer that inhibits evaporation. These effects can lead to stabilization of the tear film to promote ocular surface healing. Further, PFHO was detected in tears for at least 6 hours in a rabbit pharmacokinetic study, and results indicate that it may improve lipid layer thickness and quality. In 2 pivotal phase 3 trials in patients with DED and clinical signs of MGD (GOBI [NCT04139798] and MOJAVE [NCT04567329]), treatment with PFHO consistently met primary efficacy end points related to DED signs and symptoms (total corneal fluorescein staining and eye dryness, respectively) and was well tolerated. Compared with use of hypotonic saline solution, instillation of PFHO led to significant improvements in signs and symptoms in as early as 2 weeks. In a long-term, open-label safety extension study, efficacy of PFHO was sustained over 12 months, and the safety profile was consistent with those of previous studies. Clinical trial results indicate that treatment with PFHO effectively and consistently reduces the signs and symptoms of DED.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,dry eye,4
2023-11-08,35703427,Intranasal Varenicline: Review of a Novel Formulation for the Treatment of Dry Eye Disease.,"Objective: To examine the literature pertaining to safety and efficacy of intranasal (IN) varenicline for the treatment of dry eye disease (DED). Data Sources: A literature search of PubMed was performed (1985 to January 2022) using the following search terms: varenicline, OC-01, intranasal, and dry eye. Additional data were acquired from references of identified articles, prescribing information, government databases, and manufacturer website. Study Selection/Data Extraction: All relevant English-language studies were included in this review. Data Synthesis: IN varenicline was FDA approved for the treatment of DED in 2021. IN varenicline has demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in outcomes related to basal tear film production as measured by a Schirmer test score (STS) in data from phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. Safety data from these trials have demonstrated that IN varenicline is generally well tolerated with minimal ocular side effects. The most common side effects reported in the trials were sneezing, coughing, along with throat and nasal irritation. Relevance to Patient care and Clinical Practice: Patients suffering from DED have been traditionally treated with ophthalmic preparations; however, many patients struggle with proper administration of ophthalmic products. IN varenicline stimulates nicotinic cholinergic receptors and basal tear film production through the trigeminal parasympathetic nerve pathway (TPP). There is no evidence to support the long-term remission of DED symptoms with IN varenicline as seen with anti-inflammatory modulators. Conclusions: IN varenicline offers an effective and novel approach to management of DED for patients who desire a non-ophthalmic preparation with a favorable side effect profile.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,dry eye,4

Among them, 70.7% with UC and 50.4% with CD were biologic-naïve. At 1 year, 76.0%, 58.0%, 35.0%, and 62.2% of UC patients and 57.1%, 71.4%, 33.3%, and 30.0% of CD patients achieved clinical response, clinical remission, steroid-free remission, and mucosal healing, respectively. All patients underwent hepatitis B and tuberculosis screening before initiating biologics, and prophylaxis was recommended when necessary. One hepatitis B carrier, without antiviral prophylaxis due to economic barriers, had hepatitis B reactivation during steroid tapering and increasing azathioprine dosage, which was controlled with an antiviral agent. No tuberculosis reactivation was noted. At 12 months, non-reimbursement-related treatment persistence rates were 94.0% and 82.5% in UC and CD patients, respectively. Moreover, 75.3% of IBD patients discontinued VDZ due to mandatory drug holiday.

Within the framework of the prospective real-world RUN-CD registry, a total of approximately 900 CD patients from 44 inflammatory bowel disease centers from all over Germany starting a new therapy with UST or other biologics were screened for a real-world evidence (RWE) comparison of CD patients with UST vs antitumor necrosis factor (TNF).A total of 618 CD patients with a nonrandomized biological therapy were qualified for this induction phase effectiveness RUN-CD study of UST vs anti-TNF. To reduce selection bias in estimations of treatment effects, the propensity score with inverse probability of treatment weighting was implemented. The results were reported as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).A total of 339 UST and 279 anti-TNF patients were analyzed. The effectiveness of UST vs anti-TNF in terms of clinical remission (UST 65.4% vs anti-TNF 63.0%; OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.71-1.74) and steroid-free remission (UST 51.0% vs anti-TNF 53.8%; OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.60-1.47) was comparable at the end of induction therapy. Similar results were observed in the bio-naïve and bio-experienced UST vs anti-TNF groups. For both, the remission rates were higher in the bio-naïve than in the bio-experienced groups (P < .05).In this prospective, observational RUN-CD study, the RWE head-to-head comparison of UST vs anti-TNF showed similar induction effectiveness in both groups, remarkably higher than those found in prior RCTs.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,effectiveness,,crohn's disease,4
2023-11-08,36680556,Sweets and Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Patients Favor Artificial Sweeteners and Diet Foods/Drinks Over Table Sugar and Consume Less Fruits/Vegetables.,"While artificial sweeteners are deemed safe, preclinical studies indicate that artificial sweeteners contribute to gastrointestinal inflammation. Little is known about patients' perceptions and consumption of artificial sweeteners in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We surveyed the consumption frequency and beliefs of IBD patients and control participants regarding artificial sweeteners.We surveyed 130 individuals (IBD patients, n = 93; control/non-IBD participants, n = 37) among our tertiary hospital population to determine consumption frequency and beliefs regarding artificial sweeteners (Splenda/sucralose, Stevia/stevia, NutraSweet/Equal/aspartame). A 14-question questionnaire surveyed the frequency of 9 dietary habits, preferences, and beliefs on health benefits of commercial artificial sweeteners, using the following as positive and negative control questions: table sugar, water, fruits/vegetables, and coconut-oil, among others.Despite the similarity in yes/no consumption data, artificial sweeteners (Q4 t test P = .023) and diet (low calorie) foods/drinks (Q4 t test P = .023) were consumed more frequently by patients with IBD than by control participants, while no difference in preference for water instead of juices/sodas was observed between IBD patients and control participants. Conversely, patients with IBD consumed table sugar less frequently than control participants (Q1 t test-P = .09), in agreement with their reporting of sugary foods as cause of symptoms (P < .01). A positive correlation was observed between artificial sweeteners and fresh fruits/vegetables among the first 31 IBD patients (Spearman P = .017) and confirmed with 62 new IBD patients (r = 0.232; 95% CI, 0.02-0.43; P = .031), indicating that artificial sweeteners are deemed a healthy habit in IBD. Excluding fresh fruits/vegetables, multivariate analyses to develop surrogate principal component analysis indexes of healthy habits confirmed that artificial sweeteners consumption follows healthy preferences among our IBD patients (adjusted P < .0001).Consumption of artificial sweeteners correlated with healthy habits, suggesting that our IBD population deemed artificial sweeteners as healthy and/or had preferences for naturally or artificially sweetened flavors and products.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,"inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",4

The aim of this study was to evaluate if histologic variables are predictive of IPAA clinical outcomes and healthcare utilization.This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with IPAA undergoing surveillance pouchoscopy at a tertiary care institution. Pouch body biopsies were reviewed by gastrointestinal pathologists, who were blinded to clinical outcomes, for histologic features of acute or chronic inflammation. Charts were reviewed for clinical outcomes including development of acute pouchitis, chronic pouchitis, biologic or small molecule initiation, hospitalizations, and surgery. Predictors of outcomes were analyzed using univariable and multivariable logistic and Cox regression.A total of 167 patients undergoing surveillance pouchoscopy were included. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (odds ratio [OR], 1.67), ulceration and erosion (OR, 2.44), chronic inflammation (OR, 1.97), and crypt distortion (OR, 1.89) were associated with future biologic or small molecule initiation for chronic pouchitis. Loss of goblet cells was associated with development of chronic pouchitis (OR, 4.65). Pyloric gland metaplasia was associated with hospitalizations (OR, 5.24). No histologic variables were predictive of development of acute pouchitis or surgery. In an exploratory subgroup analysis of new IPAA (<1 year), loss of goblet cells was associated with acute pouchitis (OR, 14.86) and chronic pouchitis (OR, 12.56). Pyloric gland metaplasia was again associated with hospitalizations (OR, 13.99).Histologic findings may be predictive of IPAA outcomes. Pathologists should incorporate key histologic variables into pouchoscopy pathology reports.

The EMOTIVE study aimed to analyze the effect of vedolizumab on EIMs in a real-world cohort of patients with IBD.This multicenter, descriptive, retrospective study was conducted in Belgium, Denmark, Israel, the Netherlands, and Switzerland in adults with moderately to severely active IBD and concurrent active EIMs at vedolizumab initiation (index date), with a ≥6-month follow-up after the index date. The primary endpoint was resolution of all EIMs within 6 months of vedolizumab initiation.In 99 eligible patients, the most frequent EIMs were arthralgia (69.7%), peripheral spondyloarthritis (21.2%), and axial spondyloarthritis (10.1%). Within 6 and 12 months of vedolizumab initiation, 19.2% and 25.3% of patients reported resolution of all EIMs, while 36.5% and 49.5% of all EIMs were reported to be improved (combination of resolution and partial response), respectively. Vedolizumab treatment persistence at 12 months was 82.8%. Adverse events were reported in 18.2% of patients, with the most frequent being arthralgia (4.0%).This real-world study showed resolution of all EIMs in up to one-fourth of patients with IBD and improvement in up to half of EIMs within 12 months of vedolizumab treatment.

2023-11-08,37506368,Effects on the Human Tear Film of Applying Skin Lipids to the Ocular Surface.,"The effect of skin lipids on the formation and stability of the human tear film was investigated.Skin swab substances (SSSs) were applied to the eyes of volunteers and studied using fluorescein or with TearView, which records infrared emissivity showing tear film integrity in real time. Results were compared with similar experiments using castor oil, freshly collected meibum, or acetic acid, which simulated the low pH of the skin.Fluorescein and TearView results were comparable. TearView showed the natural unaltered tear film over the whole eye, instant changes to the tear film, and meibomian gland activity. Minimal amounts of SSS destroyed the integrity of the film and caused pain. Corneal epithelial damage could be detected. TearView showed that SSS stimulated meibomian gland secretion if applied directly to the posterior eyelid margin. Excess meibum had no effect on the tear film spread or integrity. Castor oil formed floating lenses on the tear film which were spread by a blink but then condensed back toward themselves. There was no pain or surface damage with these oils.SSS contamination of the ocular surface disrupts the tear film, causes stinging, and fluorescein staining of the corneal epithelial cells after a blink. SSS stimulates meibomian gland activity. It is possible that various ocular conditions associated with dry eye, such as blepharitis and ocular rosacea, may compromise a meibomian lipid barrier of the eye lid margin. Skin lipids would then have access to the ocular surface and cause dry eye symptoms.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,dry eye,4
2023-11-08,37563003,The Role of Diversion During Ileal Pouch Anal Anastomosis (IPAA) Creation in Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis.,"In pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC), surgery is often postponed until disease is life-threatening or refractory to immune suppression. In these settings, diverting ileostomy (DI) is theorized to have a protective effect on the new anastomosis. However, analyses have been performed only in single-institution series and the true impact of performing DI at the time of IPAA on postoperative outcomes is unclear.We performed a retrospective cohort study using claims data from the International Business Machines (IBM) MarketScan® database. Patients were sorted to the DI group if they carried a CPT code for ostomy closure within 6 months of index procedure. We examined demographics, preoperative risk factors, and performed regression analysis to compare 30-day postoperative outcomes between groups.We identified 317 patients ≤18yo that underwent IPAA procedure and met inclusion criteria from 2000 to 2019. Of these, 238 patients were assigned to the IPAA + DI cohort and 79 patients were assigned to the IPAA cohort. Adverse outcomes were comparable between cohorts. Surgical site infection (SSI) rates between IPAA and IPAA + DI were 10.1 vs. 11.3% (p = 0.67). Rates of intra-abdominal drainage procedures were 3.8 vs. 2.1% (p = 0.39). The rates of 30-day readmissions were 16.5 vs. 19.3% (p = 0.39). Creation of a DI was not associated with higher odds of 30-day readmission (OR = 1.4, p = 0.31).Creating a DI necessitates an additional surgery for closure and is not associated with decreased adverse outcomes.

2023-11-08,37647130,Risk Factors for Fibrous Ingrowth in Eyes Requiring Primary Keratoplasty.,"The aim of this study was to define risks for corneal transplantation associated with fibrous ingrowth among first-time transplant recipients.We performed a retrospective case-control study of patients with a histopathologic diagnosis of fibrous ingrowth between 2002 and 2019. Patients with fibrous ingrowth from a first corneal specimen were included. Those with incomplete records were excluded. A 1:2 case-control ratio was used. Controls were matched using surgical indication, surgery year, transplantation method, sex, and age.Seventy-eight eyes (76 patients) were included and matched with 160 control eyes. The incidence of fibrous ingrowth found on a first corneal transplant was 0.6% per year. The most common keratoplasty indications were pseudophakic corneal edema (n = 25, 32%) and aphakic corneal edema (n = 15, 19%). Cases were more likely to have a history of ocular trauma (odds ratio [OR], 2.94; 95% CI, 1.30-6.30; P = 0.007), uveitis (OR, 2.73; 95% CI, 1.12-6.63; P = 0.022), retinal detachment or previous retinal surgery (OR, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.34-4.30; P = 0.003), glaucoma tube-shunt surgery (OR, 2.70; 95% CI, 1.29-5.65; P = 0.007), aphakia (OR, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.61-5.67; P = 0.0004), or iris derangement (OR, 10.52; 95% CI, 5.45-20.30; P <0.0001). A multivariate logistic regression model using iris derangement, history of ocular trauma, history of uveitis, and history of cataract surgery demonstrated 81% sensitivity and 66% specificity in predicting presence of fibrous ingrowth.A history of ocular trauma, uveitis, retinal detachment or previous retinal surgery, glaucoma tube-shunt surgery, aphakia, and iris derangement are risks for detecting fibrous ingrowth among first-time keratoplasty recipients.

2023-11-08,37794548,The fellow eye of retinal detachment patients: Vision and clinical presentation.,"The fellow eye of a retinal detachment is at risk of developing a retinal detachment and other visually debilitating disease.To investigate the rate of bilaterality of retinal detachment (RD), the presenting visual acuity (VA), and the presence of ocular morbidity in the fellow eye of patients with RD.A multicenter, prospective, cross-sectional study examining the fellow eye of consecutive patients who were diagnosed with different types of RD. The patients were seen within one year and examined in four Nigerian eye hospitals and clinics. Demographics, VA, and clinical findings at the presentation were reported on examination of the fellow eyes.Twenty-seven (11.4%) out of 237 patients (264 eyes) had an RD in the fellow eye. The mean age of all study patients was 46.2 ± 16.8 years, M/F: 161 (67.9%)/76 (32.1%). The rates of bilaterality for rhegmatogenous, exudative, and tractional RDs were 4.2%, 11.1%, and 31.1%, respectively. Diagnosis of RD in an eye was associated with a risk of developing fellow eye rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) (P < 0.001) and tractional RD (P < 0.001), respectively. RRD in an eye was associated with a 17% risk of developing RD in the fellow eye (β = -1.6, OR = 0.202, P < 0.001). The BCVA in the fellow eye of the three types of RD varied significantly (P < 0.001). The fellow eye was blind in 25.2% of RRD, 54.1% of tractional retinal detachment (TRD), and 11.1% of exudative retinal detachment (ERD). Bilateral RD eyes were blind in RRD (85.7%), TRD (71.1%), and ERD (50%). One hundred and seven eyes (40.5%) of the total 264 RD eyes studied had other fellow eye events at the presentation.A patient with an RD in one eye is at significant risk of developing a blinding RD in the fellow eye. This risk varies with the type of RD and is highest with TRD.

2023-11-08,37932708,Healthcare service use in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease: a questionnaire on patient and parent care experiences in Germany.,"Paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) patients require chronic care over the lifespan. Care for these patients is complex, as it is adapted for childrens' life stages and changing disease activity. Guideline based care for this patient group recommends a multidisciplinary approach, which includes in addition to paediatric gastroenterologists, nutritional and psychological care services. For PIBD patients, a discrepancy between available guideline-based multidisciplinary care and actual care has been found from the provider side, but to what extent patients experience this is unclear.To identify which healthcare services were used and whether socio-demographic, geographic or disease related factors have an influence on health service utilisation.A standardised questionnaire (CEDNA) was distributed amongst parents of children aged 0-17 diagnosed with PIBD and adolescents (aged 12-17) with a PIBD. Items related to health service use were analysed, these included specialist care, additional care services, reachability of services and satisfaction with care. Logistic regression models on additional service use were calculated. Service availability and reachability maps were made.Data was analysed for 583 parent and 359 adolescent questionnaires. Over half of the respondents had Crohn's Disease (CD, patients n = 186 parents n = 297). Most patients and parents reported their paediatric gastroenterologist as their main care contact (patients 90.5%; parents 93%). Frequently reported additional services were nutritional counselling (patients 48.6%; parents 42.2%) and psychological support (patients 28.1%; parents 25.1%). Nutritional counselling was more frequently reported by CD patients in both the patient (OR 2.86; 95%CI 1.73-4.70) and parent (OR 3.1; 95%CI 1.42-6.71) sample. Of the patients, 32% reported not using any additional services, which was more likely for patients with an illness duration of less than one year (OR 3.42; 95%CI 1.26-9.24). This was also observed for the parent population (OR 2.23; 95%CI 1.13-4.4). The population-based density of specialised paediatric gastroenterologists was not proportionate to the spatial distribution of patients in Germany, which may have an influence on access.Parents and children reported highly specialised medical care.

2023-11-08,37932987,Effect of microaneurysms on the anti-VEGF treatment for diabetic macular edema: A retrospective cross-sectional study.,"Although anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment is effective for treating diabetic macular edema (DME), the effect of the microaneurysm (MA) status on the therapeutic efficacy of an anti-VEGF treatment remains unclear. Our current study investigated the effects of the number and the presence or absence of leaking MAs on DME and the efficacy of anti-VEGF therapy. A total of 51 eyes of 47 DME patients were administered anti-VEGF treatment. Fluorescence angiography results were used to determine the number of MAs and the presence or absence of leakage, with these findings matched to the optical coherence tomography maps. The correlation between the number of MAs and the retinal thicknesses and the influence of the leaking MAs was examined in order to definitively determine the effect of the anti-VEGF treatment. There was a correlation between the number of MAs and the retinal thickness of the sector in both the 6 mm (correlation coefficients: 0.42) and 3 mm (0.34) sectors (P < .001). There was also a correlation between the number of MAs and the retinal thickness in both the 6 mm (0.31) and 3 mm (0.24) sectors after undergoing the treatment (P < .01). There was a significant difference between the mean thickness of the leaking versus the non-leaking MAs in the 6 mm (388 ± 87 μm) and 3 mm (477 ± 108 μm) sectors before treatment (P < .01). There was also a significant difference for the retinal thickness between the sectors with and without leaking MAs after the treatment (P < .01). The degree of retinal edema before treatment is associated with the number of MAs and the presence of leaking MAs.

2023-11-08,37933025,Treatment of persistent flap closure with fluid gas exchange after inverted internal limiting membrane flap technique for idiopathic macular hole.,"We evaluated the results of fluid-gas exchange (FGE) for long-term flap closure of idiopathic macular holes (MH) using the inverted internal limiting (ILM) flap technique. We retrospectively included eyes showing flap closure without complete MH closure and connection of separate macular tissue 1 month postoperatively after the inverted ILM flap technique was detected by ocular coherence tomography at follow-up. Eyes remained flap closure at 2 months after surgery further underwent in-office FGE with 16% C3F8. Of the 153 eyes using the inverted ILM flap technique for idiopathic MH between June 2015 and November 2018, 10 eyes (6.99%) remained flap closure at 1 month postoperatively. Among 10 eyes, 5 eyes (50%) showed flap closure at 2 months postoperatively further underwent FGE for complete MH closure, while the remaining 5 eyes (50%) progressed directly to normal macular structures at 2 months postoperatively. Improvement in vision of all flap closure from baseline was significant (P = .015), with a mean baseline vision of 1.19 [Snellen equivalent (SE), 20/307] ± 0.52 logMAR and the mean final vision of 0.63 (SE, 20/85) ± 0.38 logMAR.

All eyes achieved complete MH closure, including the eyes that underwent FGE in a mean period of 5.60 months (range 3-10 months) after the inverted ILM flap technique. Eyes that underwent FGE achieved a higher rate of foveal restoration [complete external limiting membrane 80%; complete ellipsoid zone (EZ) 60%] than those that did not receive FGE (complete external limiting membrane: 40%; complete EZ: 10%).

We aimed to assess and compare the predictive efficacy of the MES, DUBLIN score and UCEIS score for prognosis in UC patients treated with vedolizumab (VDZ). Seventy-four UC patients who treated with VDZ from September 2021 to February 2023 were retrospectively enrolled. We used the MES, DUBLIN and UCEIS score to evaluate endoscopic findings. The predictive capability of these 3 scores for surgery or therapeutic escalation was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic curve. The mean MES, DUBLIN and UCEIS score significantly improved from 2.83 ± 0.38, 7.80 ± 1.82 and 6.24 ± 1.51 to 2.07 ± 0.88, 5.57 ± 2.68, and 3.72 ± 2.12, respectively (P < .001).

The qCSF testing was conducted with the manifold contrast vision meter (Adaptive Sensory Technology, San Diego, CA, USA). CS levels at spatial frequencies from 1 cycle per degree (CPD) to 18 CPD, the area underneath the logarithmic contrast sensitivity function (AULCSF), and contrast acuity (CA) were analyzed. The association of functional metrics with variables of interest was tested with linear models.Ninety-four study eyes from 94 study patients were included in the analysis (13 patients with eAMD, 33 patients with iAMD, and 48 healthy controls). Significant differences between the eAMD and the iAMD model estimates were only found for CS at 1 CPD (t value = -2.9, P value = 0.006) and CS at 1.5 CPD (-2.7, 0.01). A specific association between smoking years and CS at 1 CPD (P = 0.02) and CS at 1.5 CPD (P = 0.03) could be described in patients with AMD.The qCSF testing allows the fast measurement of the whole CSF, enabling the integration into clinical routine. We showed that novel qCSF-derived metrics detect slight functional differences between AMD stages, which testing by Pelli-Robson charts or VA testing would miss.

Seventy-five patients with pSS were randomized 1:1 to receive either RO5459072 or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a ≥3 point reduction from baseline in EULAR SS Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) score. We also investigated the effects of RO5459072 on quality of life, exocrine gland function, biomarkers related to SS, and safety and tolerability.The proportion of patients showing an improvement in ESSDAI score was not significantly different between the RO5459072 and placebo arms. No clinically meaningful treatment effects were observed in favour of RO5459072 for all secondary outcomes.

Study participants received intravitreal aflibercept 2.0 mg, repackaged (compounded) bevacizumab 1.25 mg, or ranibizumab 0.3 mg given up to every 4 weeks using defined retreatment criteria. Mean time in range was calculated using a BCVA letter score threshold of ≥69 (20/40 or better; minimum driving requirement in many regions), with sensitivity analyses using BCVA thresholds from 100 to 0 (20/10 to 20/800) in 1-letter increments.Time in range was defined as either the absolute or relative duration above a predefined BCVA threshold, measured in weeks or as a percentage of time, respectively. Using a BCVA letter score threshold of ≥69 (20/40 or better), the least squares mean time in range (adjusted for baseline BCVA) in Year 1 was 41.2 weeks with intravitreal aflibercept, 4.0 weeks longer (95% CI: 1.7, 6.3; p = 0.002) than bevacizumab and 3.6 weeks longer (1.3, 5.9; p = 0.004) than ranibizumab. Overall, mean time in range was numerically longer for intravitreal aflibercept for all BCVA letter score thresholds between 92 and 30 (20/20 to 20/250).

However, the types and risks of specific polyp types in IBD are less clear.We identified 41 880 individuals with IBD (Crohn's disease [CD: n = 12 850]; ulcerative colitis [UC]: n = 29 030]) from Sweden matched with 41 880 reference individuals. Using Cox regression, we calculated adjusted hazard ratios [aHRs] for neoplastic colorectal polyps [tubular, serrated/sessile, advanced and villous] defined by histopathology codes.During follow-up, 1648 [3.9%] IBD patients and 1143 [2.7%] reference individuals had an incident neoplastic colorectal polyp, corresponding to an incidence rate of 46.1 and 34.2 per 10 000 person-years, respectively. This correlated to an aHR of 1.23 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-1.35) with the highest HRs seen for sessile serrated polyps [8.50, 95% CI 1.10-65.90] and traditional serrated adenomas [1.72, 95% CI 1.02-2.91]. aHRs for colorectal polyps were particularly elevated in those diagnosed with IBD at a young age and at 10 years after diagnosis. Both absolute and relative risks of colorectal polyps were higher in UC than in CD [aHRs 1.31 vs 1.06, respectively], with a 20-year cumulative risk difference of 4.4% in UC and 1.5% in CD, corresponding to one extra polyp in 23 patients with UC and one in 67 CD patients during the first 20 years after IBD diagnosis.In this nationwide population-based study, there was an increased risk of neoplastic colorectal polyps in IBD patients.

The aflibercept monotherapy group received placebo laser. The primary outcome measure was the mean number of intravitreal aflibercept injections for each group at 24 months. Secondary outcome included: mean change in central macular thickness (CMT) and vision at trial completion, the proportion of eyes whose DMO resolved and the mean injection treatment interval. Ocular and systemic adverse events were recorded.We enrolled 48 eyes of 47 patients; 27 eyes were randomised to combination therapy (aflibercept and TPRP) and 21 to aflibercept monotherapy. Thirty-two eyes (67%) completed the 2-year study. The number of intravitreal treatments given were similar for combination therapy (10.5 (SD 5.8) and monotherapy (11.8 (SD5.6)) (P = 0.44).

Eyes were analysed in 2 cohorts by treatment duration (years 1 and 2) and then in 2 subcohorts by injection frequency (≤6 or ≥7 injections/year).Among 3099 eyes with MO secondary to BRVO, 1197 (38.6%) received ≤6 injections (mean injections, 4.6; baseline mean VA, 53 letters) and 1902 (61.4%) received ≥7 injections through 1 year (mean injections, 8.8; baseline mean VA, 52 letters). At year 1, mean VA gain from baseline was 10.4 versus 13.9 letters in eyes receiving ≤6 versus ≥7 injections (p < 0.001). At year 2, mean VA in eyes receiving ≤6 (n = 42) versus ≥7 injections (n = 227) was 64 versus 68 letters, respectively (p = 0.19). Mean VA change between the start and end of year 2 in eyes receiving ≥7 injections in year 1 and ≤6 in year 2 differed significantly from that of eyes receiving ≥7 injections in both years (-3.0 vs 0.7 letters, respectively; p < 0.001).In routine clinical practice, more frequent dosing with anti-VEGF agents was associated with greater visual benefits in eyes with MO secondary to BRVO.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,effectiveness,,retinal disease,4

The analysis included the patients' clinical and demographic data, procedural radiation exposure, and complication rates, sampling results, clinical course of the patients, and calculation of diagnostic performance data.The cases of 46 patients diagnosed with adrenocorticotropin-dependent Cushing's syndrome were evaluated. Bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling was successfully performed in 97.8 % of the cases. The overall median procedure-related fluoroscopy time was 7.8 min. (range 3.2-36.2 min.), and the median procedural dose area product was 11.9 Gy*cm2 (range 2.1-73.7 Gy*cm2). Radiation doses due to digital subtraction angiography series for visualization of the inferior petrosal sinus were 3.6 Gy*cm2 (range 1.0-18.1 Gy*cm2). Radiation doses due to fluoroscopy had a higher impact on the overall radiation exposure and were significantly influenced by the patients' habitus. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 84 %, 100 %, 100 %, and 72 % before stimulation with corticotropin-releasing hormone, and 97 %, 100 %, 100 %, and 93 % after stimulation. Concordance between magnetic resonance imaging studies and bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling results was only found in 35.6 % of the cases. The periprocedural complication rate was 2.2 %, with one patient experiencing vasovagal syncope during catheterization.Bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling is a safe procedure with high technical success rates und excellent diagnostic performance. The procedure-related radiation exposure shows large variations and depends on the complexity of cannulation as well as the patients' habitus. Fluoroscopy accounted for the largest proportion of radiation exposure. Acquisition of digital subtraction angiography series for the verification of correct catheter placement appears justified.· Bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling with CRH stimulation provides high diagnostic performance in the distinction of pituitary and ectopic Cushing's syndrome.. · The associated radiation exposure is not negligible and is significantly influenced by the use of fluoroscopy and the patients' habitus.. · Digital subtraction angiography contributes less to the overall radiation dose and appears justified for the verification of correct catheter placement..· Augustin A, Detomas M, Hartung V et al.

Nontransplanted patients at IPAA had more laparoscopic procedures [37 (46%) vs 8 (18%), P =0.002] and less blood loss (median 250 vs 400 mL, P =0.006). Morbidity and mortality at 90 days were similar. Chronic pouchitis was higher in transplanted compared with nontransplanted patients [32 (67%) vs 51 (45.5%), P =0.03], but nontransplanted patients had a higher rate of chronic antibiotic refractory pouchitis. Overall survival was similar, but nontransplanted patients had more PSC-related deaths (12.5% vs 2%, P =0.002). Pouch survival at 10 years was 90% for nontransplanted patients and 100% for transplanted patients (log-rank P =0.052). Timing of LT had no impact on chronic pouchitis, pouch failure, or overall survival. PSC recurrence was 6% at 10 years. For transplanted patients, graft survival was similar regardless of IPAA timing.In patients with PSC-IBD and IPAA, LT is linked to an increased pouchitis rate but does not affect overall and pouch survival.

Published data suggests prostacyclin-naïve patients achieve total daily oral treprostinil doses of about 6 mg by Week 16, while those on prior parenteral treprostinil reach higher doses at the same timepoint.EXPEDITE (NCT03497689), a single-arm, multicenter study, assessed the efficacy of rapid parenteral treprostinil induction to quickly reach higher doses of oral treprostinil for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.Parenteral treprostinil was titrated for 2-8 weeks, followed by cross-titration of oral treprostinil. The primary endpoint was percentage of patients reaching ≥12 mg daily of oral treprostinil at Week 16. Secondary endpoints included clinical changes from baseline to Week 16.Twenty-nine prostacyclin-naïve patients were included in efficacy analyses. At Week 16, the mean daily oral treprostinil dose was 16.4 mg; 79% of patients met the primary endpoint. From baseline to Week 16, median REVEAL Lite 2 score improved (decreased) from 6 to 3.5 (p = 0.0006). Statistically significant improvements were also seen in World Health Organization Functional Class, N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide levels, 6-minute walk distance, right atrial area, Borg Dyspnea Score, and emPHasis-10 score. Favorable trends were seen in risk stratification, echocardiography parameters, disease symptoms, and treatment satisfaction.Short-course parenteral treprostinil induction resulted in oral treprostinil doses over twice those reported in de novo initiations and may be a useful approach to quickly achieve the therapeutic benefits of oral treprostinil.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,pulmonary arterial hypertension,4

Prevention and timely treatment are critical. We investigated the potential role of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions as risk factor for ROP development.Retrospective cohort study of data from 68 tertiary level neonatal intensive care units in Germany. Preterm infants born at 22 + 0 to 28 + 6 weeks of gestation between January 2009 and December 2021 were enrolled.We included n = 12 565 infants. Prevalence of any ROP was 49.2% with most infants being diagnosed with stage 1 (21.5%) and 2 disease (17.2%). ROP stage 3 was present in 10.2%, stage 4 in 0.3%, and ROP requiring treatment in 6.6%. Infants with ROP had significantly more frequently a history of RBC transfusions. Adjusting for confounders, RBC transfusions were associated with increased odds of ROP (OR 1.4, p < 0.001), ROP progression (OR 2.1, p < 0.01) and ROP requiring treatment (OR 3.6, p < 0.001). Restrictive transfusion approaches correlated with decreased (OR 0.7, p < 0.001), liberal regimes with increased odds (OR 1.2, p = 0.001).The present study confirmed an association of RBC transfusions and ROP.

In developed countries, vitamin A deficiency due to malnutrition is rare. However, vitamin A deficiency can be caused by malabsorption resulting from bowel resection or medication. In this retrospective study, we present five cases of vitamin A deficiency retinopathy related to malabsorption secondary to medical interventions.Electronic charts over a ten-year period (2012-2022) were screened for vitamin A deficiency retinopathy. Only patients with vitamin A deficiency confirmed by laboratory tests were included. Symptoms, medical history, visual acuity, optical coherence tomography, fundus autofluorescence, electrophysiological examination, and vitamin A levels were reviewed.Five eligible cases were identified. Median age was 44.7 years (range 22.2-88.9), median duration of ocular symptoms prior to diagnosis was 14 months, and median visual acuity was 1.0 (range 0.5-1.0, Snellen, decimal). Three patients had a history of bariatric surgery, one patient had a small bowel resection and was on octreotide treatment, and one patient suffered from cystic fibrosis and had a history of small bowel resection and severe hepatopathy. Optical coherence tomography showed various abnormalities, including a reduced interdigitation zone, subretinal drusenoid deposits, and a thinned outer nuclear layer.

We obtained data on 69 eyes treated with initial 4-monthly intravitreal injections of aflibercept or ranibizumab, plus individualized treat-and-extend regimen. At 12 months, the mean (SD) change in LogMAR best corrected visual acuity from baseline was - 0.28 (0.31) in all eyes, while that in the aflibercept and ranibizumab groups were - 0.30 (0.34) and - 0.25 (0.28), respectively. Central retinal thickness decreased by 137.2 (122.4) in all eyes, 138.1 (134.2) in the aflibercept group, and 136.2 (110.9) in the ranibizumab group. Additionally, the aflibercept group had a lower mean number of injections than the ranibizumab group (8.5 vs. 8.7). The last extended dosing interval of > 12 weeks was 31.0% and 16.7% of the eyes in the aflibercept and ranibizumab groups, respectively.

2023-11-09,37936357,[Relationship between macular hole cavity cross-sectional area and retinal blood flow density and its impact on retinal function in idiopathic macular holes].,"Objective: To investigate the correlation between the cross-sectional area of the macular hole (MH) cavity and the blood flow density in different retinal layers, as well as the impact of cavity size on preoperative and postoperative retinal function in patients with idiopathic macular holes (IMH). Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted. Clinical data were collected from 18 patients (18 eyes) diagnosed with IMH who underwent vitrectomy combined with internal limiting membrane peeling at Shanxi Eye Hospital affiliated to Shanxi Medical University from August 2019 to December 2021. Visual acuity, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), and multifocal electroretinography (mfERG) were performed preoperatively and at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively. Blood flow density data were collected for the overall retina, macular center fovea, and parafoveal regions, and the cavity cross-sectional area was measured using ImageJ software. Ten healthy subjects without retinal abnormalities who underwent mfERG at Shanxi Eye Hospital affiliated to Shanxi Medical University during the same period were included as a control group. One eye was randomly selected for each subject, with 5 left eyes and 5 right eyes. Statistical analysis was performed using Pearson correlation analysis, independent samples t-test, and repeated measures analysis of variance. Results: All 18 IMH patients had unilateral disease, including 3 males and 15 females, with an average age of (64.22±4.33) years and a duration of illness of 75 (38, 120) days. In the control group, consisting of 10 subjects, 4 were male and 6 were female, with an average age of (63.67±6.96) years. Preoperatively, all 18 affected eyes exhibited a macular hole cavity, which closed and disappeared one month postoperatively. The total cavity cross-sectional area was (4.84±2.28) mm2, with an average area of (0.27±0.13) mm2. The cavity cross-sectional area was positively correlated with the MH height (r=0.82, P<0.001), ellipsoid zone disruption diameter (r=0.74, P<0.001), and preoperative BCVA (r=0.62, P=0.006). The cavity cross-sectional area was positively correlated with the blood flow density of the superficial macular center fovea (r=0.47, P=0.049) and negatively correlated with the blood flow density of the deep retina (r=-0.50, P=0.033) and deep parafoveal blood flow density (r=-0.65, P=0.003). Compared to healthy eyes in the control group, IMH eyes showed decreased amplitudes of P1 and N1 waves in mfERG, prolonged P1 wave latency except at ring 1 (2.18° outward from the foveal center), and prolonged N1 wave latency except at ring 2 (7.46° outward from the foveal center) and 5 (29.75° outward from the foveal center) (all P<0.05). The cavity cross-sectional area was only related to the preoperative latency of the N1 wave at ring 2 (r=0.64, P=0.004) and had an effect on the changes in the preoperative and postoperative latency of P1 and N1 waves at ring 1 and 5 (F=4.94, 5.96; P=0.042, 0.027). Time changes had no effect on the preoperative and postoperative amplitudes and latencies of mfERG P1 and N1 waves (all P>0.05), but the interaction between cavity cross-sectional area and time had statistical significance for the amplitudes of P1 at ring 1 and N1 at ring 2(F=6.89, 3.76; P=0.003, 0.035). Conclusions: In patients with IMH, a larger macular hole cavity cross-sectional area is associated with lower blood flow density, particularly in the deep parafoveal region, poorer visual acuity, and decreased retinal function at 7.46° outward from the foveal center.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinal disease,4
2023-11-09,37936358,[Influencing factors of visual prognosis in patients with persistent submacular fluid after successful scleral buckle surgery for macula-off retinal detachment].,"Objective: To investigate the factors influencing visual outcomes in patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) who developed persistent submacular fluid (PSF) after scleral buckling surgery. Methods: A retrospective case series analysis was conducted. Clinical data were collected from patients who underwent successful scleral buckling surgery for RRD at Beijing Tongren Hospital from June 2020 to December 2022 and were followed up. Patients with RRD involving the macular area preoperatively and graded as C1 or below in proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) were included. Surgical procedures followed a minimally invasive scleral buckling approach. PSF was defined as subretinal fluid persisting for more than 1 month postoperatively. Regular follow-up visits were scheduled at postoperative days 1, 3, 7, 2 weeks, and 1 month, followed by monthly visits until complete PSF absorption. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure, refractive error, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were performed at each follow-up time point. Eyes were divided into two groups based on whether the final follow-up BCVA was≥0.5 and whether the absorption time of PSF was>6 months, and statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, chi-squared test, and Mann-Whitney U test. Results: A total of 46 patients (46 eyes) were included in this study, comprising 25 males and 21 females, with a median age of 32.5 (21.0, 57.3) years. The preoperative equivalent spherical refractive error was (-5.27±4.05) D, and the preoperative duration of illness was 30 (14, 92) days. The preoperative BCVA (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution,logMAR) was 2.00 (1.00, 2.50). Scleral buckle surgery was performed in 28 eyes (60.9%), and 18 eyes (39.1%) underwent scleral buckle surgery combined with encircling. External drainage was performed in 15 eyes (32.6%), while 31 eyes (67.4%) had no external drainage. BCVA (logMAR) at 1 month, 3 months, and the final follow-up postoperatively was 0.60 (0.50, 1.00), 0.40 (0.28, 0.53), and 0.15 (0.00, 0.50), respectively. In the final follow-up, 31 eyes (67.4%) achieved BCVA≥0.5, and 26 eyes (56.5%) had continuous ellipsoid zone on OCT. The differences in BCVA (logMAR) between preoperative, 1 month, 3 months, and the final follow-up were statistically significant (Z=-5.85, -5.63, -4.73;all P<0.001). The absorption time of PSF postoperatively was 6.50 (3.00, 9.00) months, ranging from 2 to 19 months. The eyes with PSF duration<3 months, 3-6 months, and>6 months were 12 eyes (26.1%), 11 eyes (23.9%), and 23 eyes (50.0%), respectively. There were statistically significant differences between the two groups in preoperative BCVA≥0.05, preoperative duration of illness within 1 month, PVR grading, surgical method, and continuous ellipsoid zone on OCT (all P<0.05), while there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in PSF absorption time, different types of PSF, and intraoperative drainage (all P>0.05). The PSF absorption time in the two groups was 7 (3, 10) months and 6 (4, 8) months, with no statistically significant difference (P>0.05). Conclusions: Preoperative visual acuity, duration of illness, and PVR grading are factors influencing visual outcomes in patients with RRD who have undergone scleral buckling surgery and develop PSF. In contrast, intraoperative drainage, PSF absorption time, and different PSF types are not factors affecting visual prognosis. Although PSF may persist for a long time after scleral buckling surgery, it does not significantly impact long-term visual outcomes.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,effectiveness,,retinal disease,4

Payors often require completion of a prior authorization (PA), which is a complex approval pathway before providing coverage. If the initial PA request is denied, clinic staff must complete a time and resource-intensive process to obtain medication approval.This study measured time from decision to dose escalate to insurance approval and evaluated impact of approval time on disease activity.This was a single-center retrospective analysis of adult patients with IBD prescribed an escalated dose of biologic therapy at an academic center with an integrated specialty pharmacy team from January to December 2018. Outcomes included time to insurance approval and the association between approval time and follow-up C-reactive protein (CRP) and Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) scores. Associations were tested using linear regression analyses.220 patients were included, median age 39, 53% female, and 96% white. Overall median time from decision to dose escalate to insurance approval was 7 days [interquartile range (IQR) 1, 14]. Approval time was delayed when an appeal was required [median of 29 days (IQR 17, 43)]. Patients with a longer time to insurance approval were less likely to have CRP improvement (p = 0.019).

The sample was divided into two groups: before and after the implementation of an educational mobile app (JEDII app ™). The main outcome was the inclusion of validated activity assessment scoring systems and previously stablished reporting required elements.A total of 883 IBD colonoscopy reports were included for analysis; 621 (70.3%) procedures were performed before the implementation of the app and 262 (29.7%) after. An IBD scoring system was included in 201 (32.4%) and 148 (56.5%) colonoscopy reports before and after the adoption of the mobile app, respectively (p < 0.001). The mean number of recommended elements for quality IBD colonoscopy reporting was significantly increased after the app implementation (4.3 vs. 1.9, p < 0.001).

Adults (> 17 years) with CD were identified between 2007 and 2013 using validated algorithms. Perianal fistula positive ""cases"" were matched to up to 4 ""controls"" with CD without perianal fistulas based on age, sex, geographic region, year of CD diagnosis and duration of follow-up. Direct health care costs, excluding drug costs from private payers, were estimated annually beginning 5 years before (lookback) and up to 9 years after perianal fistula diagnosis (study completion) for cases and a standardized date for matched controls.A total of 581 cases were matched to 1902 controls. The annual per capita direct cost for cases was similar at lookback compared to controls ($2458 ± 6770 vs $2502 ± 10,752; p = 0.952), maximally greater in the first year after perianal fistulas diagnosis ($16,032 ± 21,101 vs $6646 ± 13,021; p < 0.001) and remained greater at study completion ($11,358 ± 17,151 vs $5178 ± 9792; p < 0.001). At perianal fistula diagnosis, the cost difference was driven primarily by home care cost (tenfold greater), publicly-covered prescription drugs (threefold greater) and hospitalizations (twofold greater), whereas at study completion, prescription drugs were the dominant driver (threefold greater).In our population-based cohort, perianal fistulas were associated with significantly higher direct healthcare costs at the time of perianal fistulas diagnosis and sustained long-term.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,effectiveness,,crohn's disease,4
2023-11-10,37898362,From randomised controlled trials to real-world data: Clinical evidence to guide management of diabetic macular oedema.,"Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) are generally considered the gold-standard for providing scientific evidence for treatments' effectiveness and safety but their findings may not always be generalisable to the broader population treated in routine clinical practice. RCTs include highly selected patient populations that fit specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Although they may have a lower level of certainty than RCTs on the evidence hierarchy, real-world data (RWD), such as observational studies, registries and databases, provide real-world evidence (RWE) that can complement RCTs. For example, RWE may help satisfy requirements for a new indication of an already approved drug and help us better understand long-term treatment effectiveness, safety and patterns of use in clinical practice. Many countries have set up registries, observational studies and databases containing information on patients with retinal diseases, such as diabetic macular oedema (DMO). These DMO RWD have produced significant clinical evidence in the past decade that has changed the management of DMO. RWD and medico-administrative databases are a useful resource to identify low frequency safety signals. They often have long-term follow-up with a large number of patients and minimal exclusion criteria. We will discuss improvements in healthcare information exchange technologies, such as blockchain technology and FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources), which will connect and extend databases already available. These registries can be linked with existing or emerging retinal imaging modalities using artificial intelligence to aid diagnosis, treatment decisions and provide prognostic information.

2023-11-10,37938935,Functional Changes of the Ocular Surface Sensory Nerves Due to Contact Lens Use in Young Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Users.,"The purpose of this study was to analyze the differences in corneal sensory nerve functionality in young asymptomatic (CL-A) and symptomatic (CL-S) contact lens (CL) users.CL wearers (23.8 ± 1.0 years, n = 31) were classified as CL-S with an Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) ≥ 13 (n = 14) or CL-A. Users of eye glasses (EG; 24.5 ± 0.8 years, n = 29) with OSDI < 13 participated as controls. The sensations evoked by mechanical, chemical (gas esthesiometer), and cold (4°C saline drops) stimuli were measured using the Visual Analogue Scales (VASs). Moreover, tear volume, tear break up time (TBUT), blinking frequency (BF), and ocular surface temperature (OST; IR thermography) were also measured.Mechanical and chemical stimuli produced similar scores in the CL-A and EG participants, although the CL-A subjects referred to stronger irritation (p < 0.05). Likewise, the VAS intensity in response to cold stimuli did not differ between CL-A and EG subjects, while the ability to detect cold was significantly worse in CL-S users (p < 0.05). CL-A users had a similar tear volume, a higher BF (p < 0.01) and shorter TBUT (p < 0.001) to EG wearers, and blinking and TBUT were also altered significantly in CL-S users (p < 0.01). Interestingly, the OST was significantly lower in CL-A users (p < 0.05) than in EG wearers, but not in CL-S users.Using CLs modifies corneal sensitivity, blinking and tearing in young volunteers. Even if they have yet to develop clinical signs of inflammation, they display changes in corneal sensitivity consistent with the sensitization of corneal nociceptors and the inhibition cold thermoreceptors, phenomena that occur under inflammatory conditions. The differences in corneal sensitivity and OST between CL-A and CL-S users could reflect the extent of nerve damage and inflammation at the ocular surface.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,dry eye,4
2023-11-10,37940996,Muc2 mucin O-glycosylation interacts with enteropathogenic Escherichia coli to influence the development of ulcerative colitis based on the NF-kB signaling pathway.,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestine characterized by a compromised intestinal epithelial barrier. Mucin glycans are crucial in preserving barrier function during bacterial infections, although the underlying mechanisms remain largely unexplored.A cohort comprising 15 patients diagnosed with UC and 15 healthy individuals was recruited. Stool samples were collected to perform 16S rRNA gene sequencing, while biopsy samples were subjected to nanocapillary liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) to assess O-glycosylation. Gene expression was evaluated through qPCR analysis and Western blotting. Furthermore, animal experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of Escherichia coli and/or O-glycan inhibitor benzyl-α-GalNAc on the development of colitis in mice.Our findings revealed that the mucus barrier was disrupted during the early stages of UC, while the MUC2 protein content remained unaltered. Additionally, a noteworthy reduction in the O-glycosylation of MUC2 was observed, along with significant changes in the intestinal microbiota during the early stages of UC. These changes included a decrease in intestinal species richness and an increase in the abundance of Escherichia coli (E. coli). Moreover, subsequent to the administration of galactose or O-glycan inhibitor to intestinal epithelial cells, it was observed that the cell culture supernatant had the ability to modify the proliferation and adhesive capacity of E. coli. Furthermore, when pathogenic E. coli or commensal E. coli were cocultured with intestinal epithelium, both strains elicited activation of the NF-KB signaling pathway in epithelial cells and facilitated the expression of serine protease in comparison to the untreated control. Consistently, the inhibition of O-glycans has been observed to enhance the pathogenicity of E. coli in vivo. Furthermore, a correlation has been established between the level of O-glycans and the development of ulcerative colitis. Specifically, a reduction in the O-glycan content of MUC2 cells has been found to increase the virulence of E. coli, thereby compromising the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier.Together, there exist complex interactions between the intestinal epithelium, O-glycans, and the intestinal microbiota, which may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of ulcerative colitis.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,4
2023-11-10,37942591,[Primary vitrectomy in the treatment of retinopathy of prematurity with unfavorable progression].,"The study aims to determine the indications and evaluate the results of primary vitrectomy in unfavorable progression of stage III active retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).The control group consisted of 17 patients (28 eyes) with unfavorable progression of stage III ROP, who had the disease progress after coagulation of the avascular retina and underwent the second stage of treatment - vitrectomy. The main group consisted of 5 patients (10 eyes) with unfavorable progression of stage III ROP, who underwent primary vitrectomy. Gestational age at birth was 24-30 weeks, body weight ranged from 680 to 1250 g. According to spectral optical coherence tomography (SOCT) and OCT angiography (OCT-A), the initial state of the retina and vitreoretinal interface in patients of the main and control groups were identical.A retrospective analysis of control patients, according to SOCT and OCT-A data, showed the spread of neovascularization beyond the retinal plane, its interaction with the posterior hyaloid membrane and vitreous body structures in the early stages of the disease, traction changes in the underlying retina, areas of retinoschisis, as well as thickening of the posterior hyaloid membrane. The tactics of treating patients with unfavorable progression of stage III ROP has changed since 2020. Primary vitrectomy was performed in case the signs listed above were identified. The transition of the disease to the inactive stage was recorded in all cases one month after primary vitrectomy. After one year the pathological process did not reactivate in any of the cases, and no pathological changes were found in the projection of the former proliferation ridge.Extraretinal retinovitreal neovascularization, according to multimodal preoperative diagnostics, indicates the need for vitreoretinal surgery as a pathogenetically substantiated method of treatment for unfavorable progression of stage III active ROP.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,effectiveness,,retinopathy,4
2023-11-10,37942594,[The effect of keratoconus-associated refractive errors on the results of tomographic methods of studying the posterior structures of the eye].,"The study assesses the potential influence of refractive errors in keratoconus (KC) on the results of tomographic methods of studying the structures of the posterior eye segment.The study included 30 patients with bilateral stabilized KC of stages I-IV in classification by M. Amsler. Spherical and cylindrical components of refractions were determined using automatic refractometry, keratometry measurements - based on scanning keratotopography with Scheimpflug analyzer. Aberrometry was performed to evaluate corneal wave front according to the following parameters: root mean square for lower order aberrations (RMS LOA), root mean square for higher order aberrations (RMS HOA), vertical trefoil, vertical coma, horizontal coma and spherical aberrations. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and laser confocal scanning ophthalmoscopy (HRT 3) data was used in morphometric analysis of the optic nerve head and peripapillary retina. The following morphometric parameters were analyzed: optic nerve head (ONH) area, optic disc cup area, optic disc cup volume, ratio of optic disc cup area to ONH area, neuroretinal rim area, neuroretinal rim volume, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness. All studies were performed first without correction, and 30 minutes after installing customized scleral hard contact lenses (SHCL).Compensation of the refractive errors characteristic for KC was achieved as expected with contact correction. OCT revealed a general trend for reduction in the area and volume of the optic disc cupping, ratio of area to volume of the optic disc cupping, as well as an increase in other parameters. As such, with correction the values for area and volume of the neuroretinal rim according to OCT were 2.2 and 13%, HRT 3 - 18 and 51.6%; comparable increase in mean RNFL thickness - 2.8 and 28.5%, respectively (p<0.001). According to HRT 3 data, the area and volume of optic disc cupping statistically significantly decreased (by 21 and 28%, respectively), while OCT showed statistically significant decrease only in cupping area (by 5.7%). The ratio of cupping to ONH area decreased by 6.6 and 23% relative to the initial data obtained with OCT and HRT 3, respectively. Significant decrease in ONH area amid SHCL correction was observed only with HRT 3. The revealed changes in morphometric parameters were analyzed using the fundamental principles of physiological optics. Changes in interference pattern and, consequently, morphometric parameters of structures of the eye fundus in KC are of multifactorial nature, and are mostly associated with refractive and wave artefacts occurring when the rays pass through the irregular corneal surface and cannot be optically compensated by the device. The use of SHCL as means for making the optic system relatively regular can significantly decrease the artefacts in morphometric measurements.The results obtained in this study demonstrate the practicality of tomographic examination in KC with contact correction. The optimal choice is custom-fit SHCL, which along with proper correction of refractive errors also ensures stable position of the lens on the cornea. In standard examination specialists should take into account the «false» decrease in parameters of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer and increase in ONH cupping.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,"retinopathy, retinal disease",4

Prospective follow-up lasted 144 weeks. All patients were treated with angiogenesis inhibitor (aflibercept 2 mg), and most of them (72.9%) - according to the Treat-and-Extend protocol.The average number of injections was 7.39±1.28, 4.63±0.97 and 4.06±0.81 during the first, second and third years of the follow-up, respectively. The mean baseline best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.24±0.21. After three loading doses, BCVA increased to 0.33±0.26 (+0.09; 37.5%), by the end of follow-up BCVA was 0.35±0.27 (+0.11; 45.8%). Central retinal thickness (CRT) decreased from 314.89±88.07 μm to 234.4±42.8 μm (a 25.5% decrease) by the end of the follow-up. After three loading injections baseline functional and anatomical parameters had the most significant correlations (r≥0.7, p<0.05) with intraretinal fluid, ellipsoid zone integrity and the area of macular atrophy.Analysis of the morphological and functional outcomes by the end of the first year demonstrates the feasibility of preserving the results while reducing the number of visits and injections according to the Treat-and-Extend protocol.

Rectal cancer, an important risk factor for PCCRC among patients with Crohn's disease (CD), has not previously been examined.Swedish adult patients with CD who underwent a colonoscopy within 36 months before a rectal cancer diagnosis between 2001 and 2015 were identified through the National Patient and Cancer registers. Their medical records were reviewed and a root-cause analysis and a sub-categorization according to the World Endoscopic Organization (WEO) were performed.Of 24 patients with CD and PCCRC in the rectum, 79% were men and the median age was 50 (IQR 45-59) years. The median disease duration was 21.5 (IQR 19-30) years. The cancer was located in the distal 5 cm of the rectum in 63% of the cases. Retroversion in the rectum was reported in only one case. The most common plausible explanation for PCCRC was 'possible missed lesion, prior examination adequate' (63%); when adding retroversion in the rectum, instead 77% of examinations were considered negative but deemed as inadequate. The most common PCCRC sub-category was non-interval type C (54%) and B (37%). Among those with type C, 38% should have been included in surveillance according to present guidelines.Better adherence to surveillance guidelines and more meticulous follow-up is warranted. The importance of performing rectal palpation and retroversion in the rectum is underscored and we suggest that this is included in the WEO algorithm.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,safety,,crohn's disease,4

We evaluated the presence of disorganization of retinal inner layers (DRIL), ectopic inner foveal layer (EIFL), elevation (stretching) of the ONL, cotton ball sign, and type connection between the retina and ERMs (complete adherence or multiple junction spots).The percentage of DRIL, EIFL, and stretched ONL decreased. Several factors negatively influenced visual acuity during the early postoperative controls: age, interdigitation zone defects; presence of cotton ball sign, DRIL, EIFL, and stretched ONL; and strong adhesion of the ERMs to the retina. Twenty-four months after surgery, only DRIL and strong adhesion between ERMs and the retina remained statistically significant.Younger patients (p < 0.001) and patients without DRIL (p < 0.001) experienced a faster recovery of function. The length of follow-up was associated with a decrease of factors influencing the final outcome. After 24 months, only the presence of DRIL and strong adhesion between the ERMs and the retina were significant. Assuming that DRIL appears in more advanced stages when compared with EIFL, this allows us to suggest that earlier surgery might be of more benefit in idiopathic ERMs.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,effectiveness,,retinal disease,4

Inclusion criteria were single injection of 0.625 mg  intravitreal bevacizumab and minimum age at last follow-up of 3 years. Primary outcome was retinal structure. Secondary outcomes were refractive error in spherical equivalent, monocular visual acuity, strabismus, and amblyopia.Fifty-six infants (101 eyes) met inclusion criteria. Mean birth weight was 707 ± 178 g (range, 420-1520 g). Mean gestational age was 25.0 ± 1.3 weeks (range, 22.9-29.7 weeks). Twenty-four eyes were in zone I (24%) and 77 in zone II (76%). Mean postmenstrual age at treatment was 36.9 ± 2.1 weeks (range, 32.8-42.0 weeks). At a mean age of 5.4 ± 1.6 years (range, 3.0-8.0 years), all eyes had a favourable structural outcome with no reactivation requiring treatment. Mean monocular visual acuity was 0.29 ± 0.27 logMAR (range, 0.0-1.3 logMAR; 89 of 101 eyes). Mean spherical equivalent was -1.98 ± 4.91 D (range, -16.63 to +5.38 D; 101 of 101 eyes).

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography was performed in all eyes to exclude the presence of macular neovascularization. Subretinal fluid (SRF) was measured to determine the response after anti-VEGF therapy and after observation without injections.Ten eyes of 9 patients with intermediate AMD and SRF were studied over a median period of 59.5 months (range, 7-128 months). Six patients (6 eyes) had a history of anti-VEGF therapy. Median follow-up off injections was 13.5 months (range, 4-44 months). SRF thickness remained stable and unchanged during the follow-up off injections in all eyes (n = 6) with prior injection and in all eyes (n = 4) that had never been injected. Six eyes developed complete retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) and outer retinal atrophy, and 1 eye developed incomplete RPE and outer retinal atrophy. All eyes exhibited at least 2 OCT biomarkers associated with a high risk for progression to atrophy.This study provides preliminary data regarding the progression of non-neovascular fluid in AMD with or without anti-VEGF injections. A possible mechanism for fluid development may be related to RPE pump impairment. Distinguishing neovascular versus non-neovascular fluid using multimodal imaging, including OCT angiography, is essential to avoid unnecessary anti-VEGF therapy.

Patients were categorized in 2 groups: preschool-aged group (0-7 years) and school-aged group (8-15 years). Demographic data, characteristics of trauma, Ocular Trauma Score (OTS), and initial and final best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were recorded and compared between groups.The preschool-aged group consisted of 54 patients (mean age 4.6 ± 1.8 years), and the school-aged group consisted of 39 patients (mean age 11.5 ± 2.7 years). Most of the injuries were penetrating and caused by nonmetalic sharp objects in both groups. A corneal injury was detected in 45 patients (83.3%) in the preschool-aged group and 29 patients (74.4%) in school-aged group. Localization of the corneal wound was mostly central (46.7%) in the preschool-aged group and peripheral (48.3%) in school-aged group (p = 0.045). Mean corneal wound length was significantly longer in the preschool-aged group (p = 0.018). Most of the cases in the preschool-aged group were OTS group 2 (50%), whereas most of the cases in the school-aged group were OTS group 3 (38.5%). Poor visual outcome was significantly correlated with the following factors in both groups: lower OTS, worse initial BCVA, central corneal wound, longer corneal and total wound length, and presence of lens damage, retinal detachment, and hypotonia (p < 0.05 for all). Poor final BCVA also was significantly correlated with a longer scleral wound in the school-aged group and the presence of vitreous hemorrhage and uveal tissue prolapse in the posterior segment in the preschool-aged group (p < 0.05).Localization and length of the corneal wound is closely associated with visual outcome in children with open globe injuries.

The primary endpoint was the clinical and radiological response rate. The secondary endpoints were symptomatic efficacy, safety, anal continence, quality of life (Crohn's anal fistula-quality of life scale, CAF-QoL), and predictive factors of success.We included 27 consecutive patients. The complete clinical and radiological response rates at M12 were 51.9% and 50%, respectively. The combined complete clinical-radiological response (deep remission) rate was 34.6%. No major adverse effects or changes in anal continence were reported. The perianal disease activity index decreased from 6.4 to 1.6 (p < 0.001) for all patients. The CAF-QoL score also decreased from 54.0 to 25.5 (p < 0.001). At the end of the study, M12, the CAF-QoL score was significantly lower only in patients with a complete combined clinical-radiological response relative to those without a complete clinical-radiological response (15.0 versus 32.8, p = 0.01).

In this nationwide study, we aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of these drugs in CD.We used data from the epi-IIRN cohort, including all patients with CD diagnosed in Israel. Outcomes were compared by propensity-score matching and included therapeutic failure, hospitalisations, surgeries, steroid dependency, and adverse events.Of the 19264 patients diagnosed with CD since 2005, 3885 [20%] ever received thiopurines as monotherapy and 553 [2.9%] received methotrexate. Whereas the use of thiopurines declined from 22% in 2012-2015 to 12% in 2017-2020, the use of methotrexate remained stable. The probability of sustaining therapy at 1, 3, and 5 years was 64%, 51%, and 44% for thiopurines and 56%, 30%, and 23% for methotrexate, respectively [p <0.001]. Propensity-score matching, including 303 patients [202 with thiopurines, 101 with methotrexate], demonstrated a higher rate of 5-year durability for thiopurines [40%] than methotrexate [18%; p <0.001]. Time to steroid dependency [p = 0.9], hospitalisation [p = 0.8], and surgery [p = 0.1] were comparable between groups. These outcomes reflect also shorter median time to biologics with methotrexate (2.2 [IQR 1.6-3.1 years) versus thiopurines (6.6 [2.4-8.5]; p = 0.02). The overall adverse events rate was higher with thiopurines [20%] than methotrexate [12%; p <0.001], including three lymphoma cases in males, although the difference was not significant [4.8 vs 0 cases/10 000 treatment-years, respectively; p = 0.6].Thiopurines demonstrated higher treatment durability than methotrexate but more frequent adverse events. However, disease outcomes were similar, partly due to more frequent escalation to biologics with methotrexate.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,crohn's disease,4
2023-11-13,37129565,Obefazimod: A First-in-class Drug for the Treatment of Ulcerative Colitis.,"Biologic agents and oral small molecules are the mainstays of inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] management. However, an unmet clinical need remains for additional agents with novel mechanism of action which are effective, safe, and disease-modifying; this is due to the substantial proportion of patients who do not respond, lose response, or develop intolerance to currently marketed products. microRNAs [miRNAs] that play a role in the modulation of signal transduction pathways implicated in the development of IBD hold the potential to be used as therapeutic targets. Recently, a novel first-in-class compound, obefazimod, originally conceived as a human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection drug, has shown great promise in phase II induction trials for ulcerative colitis [UC] patients. Findings from the maintenance phases of trials showed that long-term obefazimod treatment provides continued improvement in clinical symptoms of disease, with a substantial proportion of patients in clinical remission, and an overall good safety profile. With a novel mechanism of action, obefazimod is an orally available small molecule with anti-inflammatory properties through the specific and selective upregulation of miR-124 expression. The aim of this paper is to critically review the available evidence related to pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and to discuss the potential clinical implications of this first-in-class oral small molecule.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,ulcerative colitis,4
2023-11-13,37158789,Female and Male Fertility after Colectomy and Reconstructive Surgery in Inflammatory Bowel Diesase: A National Cohort Study from Sweden.,"Colectomy and reconstruction in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] may adversely affect fertility, but few population-based studies on this subject are available.Fertility was assessed in 2989 women and 3771 men with IBD and prior colectomy during 1964-2014, identified from the Swedish National Patient Register, and in 35 092 matched individuals.Reconstruction with ileoanal pouch anastomosis [IPAA] was as common as ileorectal anastomosis [IRA] in ulcerative colitis [UC] and IBD-unclassified [IBD-U] but rare in Crohn's disease [CD]. Compared with the matched reference cohort, women with IBD had lower fertility overall after colectomy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.65, confidence interval [CI] 0.61-0.69), with least impact with leaving the rectum intact [HR 0.79, CI 0.70-0.90]. Compared with colectomy only, fertility in female patients remained unaffected after IRA [HR 0.86, CI 0.63-1.17 for UC, 0.86, CI 0.68-1.08 for IBD-U and 1.07, CI 0.70-1.63 for CD], but was impaired after IPAA, especially in UC [HR 0.67, CI 0.50-0.88], and after completion proctectomy [HR 0.65, CI 0.49-0.85 for UC, 0.68, CI 0.55-0.85 for IBD-U and 0.61, CI 0.38-0.96 for CD]. In men, fertility was marginally reduced following colectomy [HR 0.89, CI 0.85-0.94], regardless of reconstruction.Fertility was reduced in women after colectomy for IBD. The least impact was seen when a deviated rectum was left intact. IRA was associated with no further reduction in fertility, whereas proctectomy and IPAA were associated with the strongest impairment. IRA therefore seems to be the preferred reconstruction to preserve fertility in selected female patients. Fertility in men was only moderately reduced after colectomy.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",4
2023-11-13,37161902,Distinct Alterations in Central Pain Processing of Visceral and Somatic Pain in Quiescent Ulcerative Colitis Compared to Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Health.,"Despite relevance to pain chronicity, disease burden, and treatment, mechanisms of pain perception for different types of acute pain remain incompletely understood in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. Building on experimental research across pain modalities, we herein addressed behavioural and neural correlates of visceral versus somatic pain processing in women with quiescent ulcerative colitis [UC] compared to irritable bowel syndrome [IBS] as a patient control group and healthy women [HC].Thresholds for visceral and somatic pain were assessed with rectal distensions and cutaneous thermal pain, respectively. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, neural and behavioural responses to individually calibrated and intensity-matched painful stimuli from both modalities were compared.Pain thresholds were comparable across groups, but visceral thresholds correlated with gastrointestinal symptom severity and chronic stress burden exclusively within UC. Upon experience of visceral and somatic pain, both control groups demonstrated enhanced visceral pain-induced neural activation and greater perceived pain intensity, whereas UC patients failed to differentiate between pain modalities at both behavioural and neural levels.When confronted with acute pain from multiple bodily sites, UC patients' responses are distinctly altered. Their failure to prioritise pain arising from the viscera may reflect a lack of adaptive behavioural flexibility, possibly resulting from long-lasting central effects of repeated intestinal inflammatory insults persisting during remission. The role of psychological factors, particularly chronic stress, in visceral sensitivity and disease-specific alterations in the response to acute pain call for dedicated mechanistic research as a basis for tailoring interventions for intestinal and extraintestinal pain symptoms in IBD.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,4
2023-11-13,37209279,Defining the safety of early ileostomy closure after ileal pouch anal anastomosis.,"The safety of early ileostomy reversal after ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) has not been established. Our hypothesis was that ileostomy reversal before 8 weeks is associated with negative outcomes.This was a retrospective cohort study from a prospectively maintained institutional database. Patients who underwent primary IPAA with ileostomy reversal between 2000 and 2021 from a Pouch Registry were stratified on the basis of timing of reversal. Those reversed before 8 weeks (early) and those reversed from 8 weeks to 116 days (routine) were compared. The primary outcome was overall complications according to timing and reason for closure.Ileostomy reversal was performed early in 92 patients and routinely in 1908. Median time to closure was 49 days in the early group and 93 days in the routine group. Reasons for early reversal were stoma-related morbidity in 43.3% (n = 39) and scheduled closure in 56.7% (n = 51). The complication rate in the early group was 17.4% versus 11% in the routine group (p = 0.085). When early patients were stratified according to reason for reversal, those reversed early for stoma-related morbidity had an increased complication rate compared to the routine group (25.6% vs. 11%, p = 0.006). Patients undergoing scheduled reversal in the early group did not have increased complications (11.8% vs. 11%, p = 0.9). There was a higher likelihood of pouch anastomotic leak when reversal was performed early for stoma complications compared to routinely (OR 5.13, 95% CI 1.01-16.57, p = 0.049).Early closure is safe but could be delayed in stoma morbidity as patients may experience increased complications.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,safety,,ulcerative colitis,4

Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the associations of baseline PRISm (FEV1 to FVC ratio, ≥ 0.70; FEV1, < 80% predicted) with subsequent risks of incident stroke (any type), ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary heart disease, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic kidney disease, all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and respiratory mortality.For this cohort analysis, 4,521 patients (22.55% of participants with T2D) showed comorbid PRISm at baseline. Over a median follow-up of 11.52 to 11.87 years, patients with T2D with PRISm at baseline showed higher risks than those with normal spirometry findings of various T2D complications developing and mortality; the adjusted hazard ratios for PRISm were 1.413 (95% CI, 1.187-1.681) for stroke (any type), 1.382 (95% CI, 1.129-1.690) for ischemic stroke, 1.253 (95% CI, 1.045-1.503) for myocardial infarction, 1.206 (95% CI, 1.086-1.339) for coronary heart disease, 1.311 (95% CI, 1.141-1.506) for diabetic retinopathy, 1.384 (95% CI, 1.190-1.610) for diabetic kidney disease, 1.337 (95% CI, 1.213-1.474) for all-cause mortality, 1.597 (95% CI, 1.296-1.967) for cardiovascular mortality, and 1.559 (95% CI, 1.189-2.044) for respiratory mortality, respectively. The addition of PRISm significantly improved the reclassification ability, based on the net reclassification index, of an office-based risk score by 15.53% (95% CI, 10.14%-19.63%) to 33.60% (95% CI, 20.90%-45.79%).Individuals with T2D with comorbid PRISm, accounting for a considerable proportion of the population with T2D, showed significantly increased risks of adverse macrovascular and microvascular complications and mortality.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinopathy,4
2023-11-13,37419770,Geographic variation in diabetic retinopathy screening within the Veterans Health Administration.,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains the leading cause of vision impairment among working-age adults in the United States. The Veterans Health Administration (VA) supplemented its DR screening efforts with teleretinal imaging in 2006. Despite its scale and longevity, no national data on the VA's screening program exists since 1998. Our objective was to determine the influence of geography on diabetic retinopathy screening adherence.Setting: VA national electronic medical records.A national cohort of 940,654 veterans with diabetes (defined as two or more diabetes ICD-9 codes (250.xx)) without a history of DR.125 VA Medical Center catchment areas, demographics, comorbidity burden, mean HbA1c levels, medication use and adherence, as well as utilization and access metrics.Screening for diabetic retinopathy within the VA medical system within a 2-year period.Within a 2-year time frame 74 % of veterans without a history of DR received retinal screenings within the VA system. After adjustment for age, gender, race-ethnic group, service-connected disability, marital status, and the van Walraven Elixhauser comorbidity score, the prevalence of DR screening varied by VA catchment area with values ranging from 27 % to 86 %. These differences persisted after further adjusting for mean HbA1c level, medication use and adherence as well as utilization and access metrics.The wide variability in DR screening across 125 VA catchment areas indicates the presence of unmeasured determinants of DR screening.

2023-11-13,37606703,The effects of mydriatic eye drops on cerebral blood flow and oxygenation in retinopathy of prematurity examinations.,"Mydriatic eye drops used during retinopathy examination have been associated with cardiovascular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal side effects. The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of the drops used for pupil dilatation on cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygenation. The study included 62 infants who underwent retinopathy screening exams. Vital signs, heart rate (HR), arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were recorded. Cerebral oxygenation and middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity were evaluated using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and Doppler ultrasonography, respectively, and the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) was also calculated. The mean gestational age of the infants included was 31.29 ± 1.42 weeks, and the mean birth weight was 1620 ± 265 g. Heart rate was found to be significantly decreased after mydriatic eye drop instillation; however, there were no significant differences regarding blood pressure and oxygen saturation levels (HR: p < 0.001; MAP: p = 0.851; SpO2: p = 0.986, respectively). After instillation while cerebral regional oxygen saturation (rScO2) measurements were significantly decreased at the 60th minute (p = 0.01), no significant difference was found in Vmax and Vmean of MCA before and after mydriatic eye drop instillation (p = 0.755, p = 0.515, respectively). Regarding CMRO2 measurements, we also did not find any statistical difference (p = 0.442).    Conclusion: Our study has shown that although eye drops may affect heart rate and regional cerebral oxygen saturation, they do not alter cerebral blood flow velocities and metabolic rate of oxygen consumption. Current recommendations for mydriatic eye drop use in retinopathy exam appear to be safe. What is Known: • Mydriatic eye drop installation is recommended for pupil dilatation during ROP screening exams. • It's known that mydriatics used in ROP examination have affects on the vital signs, cerebral oxygenation and blood flow. What is New: • This is the first study evaluating the changes in cerebral oxygenation and blood flow velocity after mydriatic drop instillation using NIRS and Doppler US concomitantly. • While the eye drops may affect heart rate and regional cerebral oxygen saturation, they do not alter cerebral blood flow velocities and metabolic rate of oxygen consumption.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,safety,,retinopathy,4
2023-11-13,37792586,Physical activity in childhood and later risk of inflammatory bowel disease: A Scandinavian birth cohort study.,"Retrospective data have linked adult physical activity (PA) to reduced risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed to prospectively examine the association of PA and screen time (ST) in childhood with later risk of IBD, for which data are scarce.Using two population-based birth cohorts (All Babies in Southeast Sweden [ABIS] and Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study [MoBa]), we retrieved parent-reported data on PA and ST degree at ages 3 and 8 years. Data were modelled as binary (high vs. low) and numerical (hours/day) exposures. Inflammatory bowel disease was defined as ≥2 diagnostic records in national health registers. Cox regression estimated hazard ratios adjusted for potential confounding from parental IBD, country of origin, education, and smoking habits (Adjusted hazard ratio (aHR)). Our 8-year analyses included a 2-year lag period to reduce the risk of reverse causation. Cohort-specific estimates were pooled using random-effects model.Among 65,978 participants from ABIS (n = 8810) and MoBa (n = 57,168) with available data, 266 developed IBD. At 3 years, children with high versus low PA had an aHR of 1.12 for IBD (95%CI = 0.87-1.43); high versus low ST showed an aHR of 0.91 (95%CI = 0.71-1.17). Conversely, at 8 years, high versus low ST was associated with increased risk of later IBD (aHR = 1.51; 95%CI = 1.02-2.25), but PA at 8 years, was not linked to IBD (aHR = 1.19; 95%CI = 0.80-1.76). Subtype-specific analyses for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis did not differ appreciably.Acknowledging possible confounding variables, children with high versus low ST at 8 years were at increased risk of IBD. In contrast, PA degree was not linked to IBD at any age category.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,effectiveness,,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",4
2023-11-13,37945295,Impact of a short online course on the accuracy of non-ophthalmic diabetic retinopathy graders in recognising glaucomatous optic nerves in Vietnam.,"To test an online training course for non-ophthalmic diabetic retinopathy (DR) graders for recognition of glaucomatous optic nerves in Vietnam.This was an uncontrolled, experimental, before-and-after study in which 43 non-ophthalmic DR graders underwent baseline testing on a standard image set, completed a self-paced, online training course and were retested using the same photographs presented randomly. Twenty-nine local ophthalmologists completed the same test without the training course. DR graders then underwent additional one-to-one training by a glaucoma specialist and were retested. Test performance (% correct, compared with consensus grades from four fellowship-trained glaucoma experts), sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and area under the receiver operating (AUC) curve, were computed.Mean age of DR graders (32.6±5.5 years) did not differ from ophthalmologists (32.3±7.3 years, p=0.13). Online training required a mean of 297.9 (SD 144.6) minutes. Graders' mean baseline score (33.3%±14.3%) improved significantly after training (55.8%±12.6%, p<0.001), and post-training score did not differ from ophthalmologists (58.7±15.4%, p=0.384). Although grader sensitivity reduced before [85.5% (95% CI 83.5% to 87.3%)] versus after [80.4% (78.3% to 82.4%)] training, specificity improved significantly [47.8 (44.9 to 50.7) vs 79.8 (77.3 to 82.0), p<0.001]. Grader AUC also improved after training [66.6 (64.9 to 68.3)] to [80.1 (78.5 to 81.6), p<0.001]. Additional one-to-one grader training by a glaucoma specialist did not further improve grader scores.Non-ophthalmic DR graders can be trained to recognise glaucoma using a short online course in this setting, with no additional benefit from more expensive one-to-one training. After 5-hour online training in recognising glaucomatous optic nerve head, scores of non-ophthalmic DR graders doubled, and did not differ from local ophthalmologists.

The patients were classified into three groups: the control group (group 1), T2DM group (group 2), and both T2DM and HTN group (group 3). Peripapillary vessel density (VD) was compared using analysis of covariance and linear regression analysis was performed to identify the factors affecting the peripapillary VD. A total of 286 eyes were enrolled: 124 in group 1, 111 in group 2, and 51 in group 3. The peripapillary VDs for the full area were 18.3 ± 0.6, 17.8 ± 1.0, and 17.3 ± 1.2 mm-1 in group 1, group 2, and group 3, respectively, which were significantly different after adjustment for age and best-corrected visual acuity (P < 0.001). In post hoc analyses, group 1 versus group 2 (P < 0.001), group 1 versus group 3 (P < 0.001), and group 2 versus group 3 (P = 0.001) showed significant differences. In linear regression analysis, HTN (B =  - 0.352, P = 0.043) and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness (B = 0.045, P < 0.001) were significantly associated with peripapillary VD in T2DM patients. Peripapillary VD in T2DM patients without clinical DR were lower compared to normal controls, and they were more decreased when HTN was comorbid. The combination of ischemic damage by high blood pressure and impairment of the neurovascular unit by hyperglycemia would result in more severe deterioration of peripapillary microvasculature, and this impairment could be also reflected by pRNFL thinning.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinopathy,4

The study enrolled 40-55-year-old adults with presbyopia and dry eye syndromes (DES). The subjects were randomly assigned to three groups wearing different designs of contact lenses (Proclear, SMR, and Optimum) for 6-8 h a day for two weeks. Ocular surface health, tear quality, visual quality, and visual function were measured before and after lens wear. No significant difference was observed across all three groups for the amount of conjunctival redness, blink frequency (lens on), and stereopsis vision before and after wearing. Although there seemed to be a significant declining trend for corneal staining and limbal redness, non-invasive tear break-up time (TBUT), and lipid layer thickness while lens wear, the measured values were all within the normal range. Vice-versa after lens removal, results also showed significant improvement on lipid layer thickness, blink frequency (lens off), and contact TBUT. A significant improvement was observed in the modulation transfer function (MTF) of the total area ratio after wearing contact lenses. In contrast, the MTF of the high-order aberration area ratio resulting from lens wear was lower than that of the baseline measurement. There are also significant improvements observed for SMR and Optimum regarding near visual acuity, near point of accommodation, and the subjective questionnaire (OSDI and VBP) scores.

2023-11-13,37947534,The Impact of Psychotrauma and Emotional Stress Vulnerability on Physical and Mental Functioning of Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic health condition thought to be influenced by personal life experiences and emotional stress sensitivity (neuroticism). In the present study, we examined the impact of cumulative trauma experiences and trait neuroticism (as a measure for emotional stress vulnerability) on physical and mental functioning of n = 211 patients diagnosed with IBD (112 Crohn's disease, 99 ulcerative colitis). All patients were assessed for self-reported trauma histories, emotional stress vulnerability, clinical disease activity, functional gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, and quality of life. Results showed that patients with severe IBD activity have endured significantly more interpersonal trauma and victimization than those with quiescent IBD. Moreover, cumulative trauma was found to exert an indirect (neuroticism-mediated) effect on patients' symptom complexity, with trauma and neuroticism conjointly explaining 16-21% of the variance in gastrointestinal and 35% of the variance in mental symptoms. Upon correction for condition (using a small group of available controls, n = 51), the predictive capacity of trauma and neuroticism increased further, with both predictors now explaining 31% of the somatic-and almost 50% of the mental symptom heterogeneity. In terms of trauma type, victimization (domestic violence and intimate abuse) proved the best predictor of cross-sample symptom variability and the only trauma profile with a consistent direct and indirect (neuroticism-mediated) effect on patients' mental (QoL) and physical fitness. Results are consistent with the growing body of evidence linking experiential vulnerability factors (trauma and neuroticism) and associated feelings of personal ineffectiveness, helplessness, and uncontrollability to interindividual differences in (GI) disease activity and quality of life.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, biomarker",,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",4

This study evaluates short-term outcomes of pediatric patients following ileocolic resection and Kono-S anastomosis.A retrospective review of patients < 18 years old who underwent ileocolic resection followed by Kono-S anastomosis compared with those who underwent a stapled anastomosis.Nine Kono-S patients were matched with nine patients preceding them who received traditional side-to-side and end-to-side anastomoses. All patients underwent minimally invasive surgery. Demographics, pre-operative medication usage, and symptom profiles were not significantly different. Traditional anastomosis (TA) patients had longer lengths of stay (4.6 vs 2.9 days; p = 0.03) but had no statistically significant differences in blood loss, procedure length, and pathologic findings. One Kono-S patient had a superficial surgical site infection, and one TA patient had an anastomotic leak requiring reoperation within 30 days. More TA patients experienced post-operative symptoms at both 30-day and 6-month follow-up (66.7% vs 33.3%; p = 0.16 and 77.8% vs 25%; p = 0.03).The Kono-S anastomosis appears to be safe in pediatric CD when compared to traditional stapled anastomoses.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"safety, effectiveness",,,4

We examined incidence and determinants of sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy (STDR) in a sociodemographically diverse multi-ethnic population.North East London DESP cohort data (January 2012 to December 2021) with 137 591 PLD with no retinopathy, or non-STDR at baseline in one/both eyes, were used to calculate STDR incidence rates by sociodemographic factors, diabetes type, and duration. HR from Cox models examined associations with STDR.There were 16 388 incident STDR cases over a median of 5.4 years (IQR 2.8-8.2; STDR rate 2.214, 95% CI 2.214 to 2.215 per 100 person-years). People with no retinopathy at baseline had a lower risk of sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy (STDR) compared with those with non-STDR in one eye (HR 3.03, 95% CI 2.91 to 3.15, p<0.001) and both eyes (HR 7.88, 95% CI 7.59 to 8.18, p<0.001). Black and South Asian individuals had higher STDR hazards than white individuals (HR 1.57, 95% CI 1.50 to 1.64 and HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.31 to 1.42, respectively). Additionally, every 5-year increase in age at inclusion was associated with an 8% reduction in STDR hazards (p<0.001).Ethnic disparities exist in a health system limited by capacity rather than patient economic circumstances.

2023-11-14,36912812,Effect of Accessible Nonmydriatic Retinal Imaging on Diabetic Retinopathy Surveillance Rates.,"Purpose: To evaluate the impact on surveillance rates for diabetic retinopathy (DR) by providing nonmydriatic retinal imaging as part of comprehensive diabetes care at no cost to patients or insurers. Methods: A retrospective comparative cohort study was designed. Patients were imaged from April 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017 at a tertiary diabetes-specific academic medical center. Retinal imaging was provided without additional cost beginning October 16, 2016. Images were evaluated for DR and diabetic macular edema using standard protocol at a centralized reading center. Diabetes surveillance rates before and after no-cost imaging were compared. Results: A total of 759 and 2,080 patients respectively were imaged before and after offering no-cost retinal imaging. The difference represents a 274% increase in the number of patients screened. Furthermore, there was a 292% and 261% increase in the number of eyes with mild DR and referable DR, respectively. In the comparative 6-month period, 92 additional cases of proliferative DR were identified, estimated to prevent 6.7 cases of severe visual loss with annual cost savings of $180,230 (estimated yearly cost of severe vision loss per person: $26,900). In patients with referable DR, self-awareness was low, with no significant difference in the before and after groups (39.4% vs. 43.8%, p = 0.3725). Conclusions: Providing retinal imaging as part of comprehensive diabetes care substantially increased the number of patients identified by nearly threefold. The data suggest that the removal of out-of-pocket costs substantially increased patient surveillance rates, which may translate to improved long-term patient outcomes.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, diagnostic",,retinopathy,4
2023-11-14,36928128,Racial Disparities in Barriers to Care for Patients With Diabetic Retinopathy in a Nationwide Cohort.,"To ascertain specific barriers of care among patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR) from different racial/ethnic groups.In this cross-sectional study, we included adult participants in the National Institutes of Health All of Us Research Program with DR who answered questions in the Healthcare Access & Utilization survey and Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) survey. Logistic regression was used to study the association between barriers to care and race/ethnicity.Our cohort included 885 DR patients who answered the Healthcare Access & Utilization survey and 385 DR patients who responded to the SDoH survey. After adjusting for confounders, Hispanic individuals were more likely than non-Hispanic White individuals to report delaying getting medical care due to not being able to get child care (odds ratio [OR] = 6.57 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.67-27.8]). Furthermore, compared to non-Hispanic White individuals, non-Hispanic Black individuals were significantly more likely to report being treated with less respect (OR = 2.62 [95% CI, 1.15-5.80]), treated with less courtesy (OR = 2.51 [95% CI, 1.01-5.92]), and receive poorer service than other people (OR = 2.85 [95% CI, 1.25-6.34]) when they go to a doctor's office or other healthcare provider.We found that Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black individuals with DR reported greater delays/barriers to care compared to non-Hispanic White individuals even after controlling for individualized socioeconomic factors.This study highlights the importance of taking steps to promote health equity, such as increasing access to child care resources and reducing implicit bias among eye care providers, to increase access to care and prevent vision loss from DR.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,effectiveness,,retinopathy,4

This study aimed to gain insight from patients, dietitians and gastroenterologists into inflammatory bowel disease dietetic care in New Zealand.Mixed-methods surveys were developed and then distributed online to patients with inflammatory bowel disease and dietitians and gastroenterologists that care for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Quantitative survey data were analysed using nonparametric statistical tests. Qualitative survey data were analysed using thematic analysis.Responses were received from 406 inflammatory bowel disease patients, 79 dietitians and 40 gastroenterologists. Half of the patients (52%) had seen a dietitian for nutrition advice. Patients more likely to have seen a dietitian were/had: Crohn's disease (p = 0.001), previous bowel surgery (p < 0.001), younger (p < 0.001) or receiving biologic therapy (p = 0.005). Two-thirds (66%) of patients found the dietitian advice at least moderately useful. A common theme from patient comments was that dietitians needed better knowledge of inflammatory bowel disease. Almost all (97%) gastroenterologists reported that their inflammatory bowel disease patients ask about nutrition; 57% reported that there were inadequate dietitians to meet patient needs. Over 50% of dietitians saw inflammatory bowel disease patients infrequently and 39% were not confident that their knowledge of the nutritional management of inflammatory bowel disease was current. Dietitians desired greater links with the inflammatory bowel disease multidisciplinary team.Current inflammatory bowel disease dietetic services in New Zealand are inadequate. Standardised care, increased resourcing, dietitian training in inflammatory bowel disease, and stronger links with the multidisciplinary team are suggested to improve services.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,effectiveness,,"crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis",4

The appearance of a well-defined hyperreflective inner boundary that separated persistent HRM from the neurosensory retina continuous with the adjacent retinal pigment epithelium layer was defined as hyperreflective material boundary remodeling (HRM-BR). Patterns of HRM composition/evolution were defined as follows: (1) no subretinal HRM at baseline, (2) fully resolved, (3) persistent with complete HRM-BR, or (4) partial/absent HRM-BR. Associations of HRM patterns with BCVA and HTC were analyzed. Predictive factors for complete HRM-BR were explored.Of 207 included eyes, subretinal HRM was present in 159 (76.8%) at baseline and persisted until month 9 in 118 (57.0%) eyes. Of these 118 eyes, 44.9% developed complete HRM-BR and had similar BCVA outcomes by month 9 compared with no/fully resolved subretinal HRM. Partial/absent HRM-BR had a strong negative association with BCVA outcome (-6.1 ETDRS letters; P = 0.016) and a higher frequency of intralesional HTC (69.2%) compared with eyes with complete HRM-BR (20.8%) at month 9. Older age (odds ratio [OR], 0.96; P = 0.054) and presence of intralesional HTC (OR, 0.06; P = 0.010) at baseline were associated with lower odds of complete HRM-BR at month 9.In nAMD eyes under antiangiogenic treatment, complete HRM-BR occurred frequently and was associated with better BCVA than when HRM-BR was only partial/absent.Proprietary or commercial disclosure may be found in the Footnotes and Disclosures at the end of this article.",no,yes,no,human RCT,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinal disease,4

Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) provides a noninvasive quantitative and qualitative body composition assessment. The aim of this study was to determine the role of phase angle (PhA), a BIA-measure of skeletal muscle quality and body cell mass, on CRF in patients with obesity and HFpEF.Fifty-nine consecutive outpatients with HFpEF underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing to measure CRF. Single-frequency segmental BIA was used to measure PhA and body composition quantity. Resting Doppler echocardiography and biomarkers were measured to assess cardiac function and systemic inflammation.Compared with patients with lower PhA, patients with higher PhA (above mean 5.8°) presented a greater absolute peak oxygen consumption (VO2; 1.83 [1.3-2.1] versus 1.39 [1.1-1.6] L/min, P = 0.003), VO2 peak adjusted for body weight (17.5 [12.3-18.1] versus 13.3 [12.7-15.2] mL/kg/min, P = 0.040), and a lower edema index (48.7 [2.9] versus 51.4% [2.7], P < 0.001) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP; 64 [50-121] versus 183 [68-343.5] pg/dL, P < 0.001). In the overall sample, PhA was correlated with absolute VO2 peak (r = 0.468, P < 0.001), VO2 peak adjusted for body weight (r = 0.368, P = 0.004), VO2 peak adjusted for fat-free mass (r = 0.315, P = 0.015), edema index (r = -0.508, P < 0.001), and NT-proBNP (r = -0.579, P < 0.001).

The primary aim of this study is to determine whether growth hormone use in pediatric IBD leads to improved height outcomes.This was a retrospective chart review of patients with IBD aged 0-21 years followed at a single center between 2018 and 2021 treated with at least 1 year of GH. Records collected included demographics, IBD phenotype, IBD disease activity scores, medications, weight z-score, height z-score, bone age, and details of GH therapy including testing for GH deficiency. The primary outcome measure was change in height z-score after 1 year of GH treatment.Forty-six patients were identified and 18 were excluded. Of the 28 patients included (7 female; 25.0 %), 26 (92.9 %) had a diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD) and 2 (7.1 %) had ulcerative colitis (UC). The mean (SD) age at GH initiation was 9.6 (3.4) years.

2023-11-14,37953270,Retinal layers changes in patients with age-related macular degeneration treated with intravitreal anti-VEGF agents.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate retinal layers changes in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) treated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents and to evaluate if these changes may affect treatment response.This study included 496 patients with AMD or PCV who were treated with anti-VEGF agents and followed up for at least 6 months. A comprehensive analysis of retinal layers affecting visual acuity was conducted. To eliminate the fact that the average thickness calculated may lead to differences tending to converge towards the mean, we proposed that the retinal layer was divided into different regions and the thickness of the retinal layer was analyzed at the same time. The labeled data will be publicly available for further research.Compared to baseline, significant improvement in visual acuity was observed in patients at the 6-month follow-up. Statistically significant reduction in central retinal thickness and separate retinal layer thickness was also observed (p < 0.05). Among all retinal layers, the thickness of the external limiting membrane to retinal pigment epithelium/Bruch's membrane (ELM to RPE/BrM) showed the greatest reduction. Furthermore, the subregional assessment revealed that the ELM to RPE/BrM decreased greater than that of other layers in each region.Treatment with anti-VEGF agents effectively reduced retinal thickness in all separate retinal layers as well as the retina as a whole and anti-VEGF treatment may be more targeted at the edema site.

Patients in these studies received upadacitinib 45 mg once daily or placebo as induction treatment. Responders to induction treatment were rerandomized in the U-ACHIEVE maintenance study to upadacitinib 15 mg once daily, upadacitinib 30 mg, or placebo. The percentage of patients reporting no abdominal pain and no bowel urgency daily via an electronic diary and a meaningful within-person change (≥5 points) in the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue score were evaluated.The results demonstrated a statistically significantly greater percentage of patients reporting no abdominal pain and absence of bowel urgency observed from week 2 (P < .001), with upadacitinib induction treatment and clinically meaningful improvements in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue score observed at week 8 (P < .001), when compared with placebo. The maintenance study showed that significant and meaningful improvements in abdominal pain, bowel urgency, and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue score achieved during induction were sustained through 52 weeks of maintenance treatment in upadacitinib- vs placebo-treated patients.The findings of this study support the additional benefit of upadacitinib in treating moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis by demonstrating a statistically significant impact on clinically meaningful symptoms of fatigue, bowel urgency, and abdominal pain.(U-ACHIEVE induction and maintenance studies; NCT02819635; U-ACCOMPLISH induction study; NCT03653026).",no,yes,no,human RCT,effectiveness,,ulcerative colitis,4
2023-11-15,37857254,Azathioprine dose tailoring based on pharmacogenetic information: Insights of clinical implementation.,"Azathioprine is commonly used as an immunosuppressive antimetabolite in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, autoimmune disorders (such as Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis), and in patients receiving organ transplants. Thiopurine-S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is a cytoplasmic trans-methylase catalyzing the S-methylation of thiopurines. The active metabolites obtained from thiopurines are hydrolyzed into inactive forms by the Nudix hydrolase 15 (NUDT15). The TPMT*2 (defined by rs1800462), *3A (defined by rs1800460 and rs1142345), *3B (defined by rs1800460), *3C (defined by rs1142345), *6 (defined by rs75543815), and NUDT15 rs116855232 genetic variant have been associated, with the highest level of evidence, with the response to azathioprine, and, the approved drug label for azathioprine and main pharmacogenetic dosing guidelines recommend starting with reduced initial doses in TPMT intermediate metabolizer (IM) patients and considering an alternative treatment in TPMT poor metabolizer (PM) patients. This study aims to assess the clinical impact of azathioprine dose tailoring based on TPMT genotyping studying the azathioprine toxicity and efficacy, treatment starts, and dose adjustments during follow-up, comparing TPMT IM/PM and normal metabolizer (NM) patients. It also studied the association of NUDT15 rs116855232 with response to azathioprine in patients receiving a tailored treatment based on TPMT and characterized the TMPT and NUDT15 studied variants in our population. Results show that azathioprine dose reduction in TPMT IM patients (TPMT*1/*2, *1/*3A, or *1/*3C genotypes) is related to lower toxicity events compared to TPMT NM (TPMT *1/*1 genotype), and lower azathioprine dose adjustments during follow-up without showing differences in the efficacy.

2023-11-15,37934499,Differences in Cerebral Tissue Oxygenation in Preterm Neonates Receiving Adult or Cord Blood Red Blood Cell Transfusions.,"Repeated transfusions in preterm neonates with anemia of prematurity replace fetal hemoglobin (HbF) with adult Hb (HbA), which has a low oxygen affinity. The reduction of HbF is associated with a higher incidence of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).To assess whether HbF and HbA are differently associated with cerebral tissue oxygenation in preterm neonates.This cohort study was a single-center, pilot study on cerebral oxygenation kinetics in preterm neonates with a gestational age between 24.0 weeks and 27.9 weeks who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli IRCCS from December 27, 2021, to May 15, 2023. This study was ancillary to the ongoing, double-blind, multicenter Umbilical or Adult Donor Red Blood Cells in Extremely Low Gestational Age Neonates and Retinopathy of Prematurity (BORN) randomized clinical trial. The BORN trial outcome was ROP severity in neonates randomized to receive standard packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions obtained from RBCs of adult donors (A-RBCs) or from cord blood (CB-RBCs). According to standard procedures at the institute's neonatal intensive care unit, patients concurrently received continuous cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring. This cohort study was not prespecified in the trial protocol.Transfusion with A-RBCs or CB-RBCs.The main outcome was the kinetics of cerebral regional oxygen saturation (crSO2) and cerebral fraction of tissue oxygen extraction (cFTOE) associated with A-RBC or CB-RBC transfusions. Cerebral NIRS monitoring was performed by neonatologists and nurses, who were blinded to the PRBC type. The NIRS monitoring was conducted starting with the blood product order, during transfusion, and for the subsequent 24 hours after transfusion completion. The mean treatment effects of A-RBCs or CB-RBCs were quantified using a linear mixed model for repeated measures.Of 23 randomized neonates, 17 (11 male [64.7%]; median gestational age at birth, 25.6 weeks [IQR, 25.3-26.1 weeks]) with a median birth weight of 840 g (IQR, 580-900 g) were included in the study; NIRS was evaluated for 42 transfusion episodes, of which 22 were A-RBCs and 20 were CB-RBCs. Globally considering all posttransfusion time points, the overall crSO2 covariate-adjusted mean after CB-RBC transfusions was 5.27% lower (95% CI, 1.20%-9.34%; P = .01) than that after A-RBC transfusions, while the cFTOE after CB-RBC transfusions was 6.18% higher (95% CI, 1.66%-10.69%; P = .009) than that after A-RBCs.The findings of this cohort study suggest that A-RBC transfusions may be associated with more oxygen delivery to cerebral tissues of preterm neonates than transfusions from CB-RBCs. This finding may explain the previously observed association between low HbF and high ROP risk. It also suggests that use of CB to meet the RBC transfusion needs of neonates with a gestational age of less than 28 weeks may protect cerebral tissues from overexposure to oxygen.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,retinopathy,4

The cases fulfilled the RA classification criteria according to the 2010 American College of Rheumatology and European League and underwent full lab investigations. They were distributed to two groups based on the DAS-28 questionnaire. The patients were distributed into low to moderate activity (3.2 < score <  = 5.1) and high activity groups (score > 5.1).This study included 60 eyes of 30 RA patients. They scored a mean age of (44 ± 10 years), number of swollen joints (3 ± 3), number of tender joints (5 ± 3), duration of disease (8 ± 4), activity of the disease measured by DAS-28 (4.4 ± 0.9), and sex (males were 9.7% vs females 90.3%). The number of swollen joints, tender joints, ESR and DAS-28 were more in the high activity group with the p-value of (0.018, 0.001, < 0.003 and < 0.004), respectively. There are no statistically significant differences between both groups as regards disease duration (p-value of 3.8). The high activity group showed significant affection regarding the mebioscore of the lower and upper lids, total mebioscore, percentage of meibomian glands in upper and lower lids, first non-invasive break-up time test (NIV-BUT) of the tear film, as well as average non-invasive break-up time test (NIavg-BUT).

Selnoflast (RO7486967) is an orally active, potent, selective and reversible small molecule NLRP3 inhibitor. We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 1b study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of selnoflast.Nineteen adults with previous diagnosis of UC and current active moderate to severe disease were randomized 2:1 to selnoflast or placebo for 7 days. A dose of 450 mg QD (once daily) was selected to achieve 90% IL-1β inhibition in plasma and colon tissue. Consecutive blood, sigmoid colon biopsies and stool samples were analyzed for a variety of PD markers. Safety and PK were also evaluated.Selnoflast was well-tolerated. Plasma concentrations increased rapidly after oral administration, reaching Tmax 1 h post-dose. Mean plasma concentrations stayed above the IL-1β IC90 level throughout the dosing interval (mean Ctrough on Day 1 and Day 5: 2.55 μg/mL and 2.66 μg/mL, respectively). At steady state, post-dose selnoflast concentrations in sigmoid colon (5-20 μg/g) were above the IC90 . Production of IL-1β was reduced in whole blood following ex vivo stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (in the selnoflast arm). No changes were observed in plasma IL-18 levels. There were no meaningful differences in the expression of an IL-1-related gene signature in sigmoid colon tissue, and no differences in the expression of stool biomarkers.Selnoflast was safe and well-tolerated. Selnoflast 450 mg QD achieved plasma and tissue exposure predicted to maintain IL-1β IC90 over the dosing interval. However, PD biomarker results showed no robust differences between treatment arms, suggesting no major therapeutic effects are to be expected in UC.

The contents of the SF-7a scale were cognitively debriefed to evaluate content validity. A psychometric evaluation was performed using data from clinical trials of patients with CD (N = 360) and UC (N = 214). Correlations with Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ), Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI; CD only), and Mayo score (UC only) determined validity. The Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) was used to evaluate reliability and responsiveness to change. Using PGIC as an anchor, a preliminary threshold for clinically meaningful change was identified to define fatigue response in both CD and UC patients.All patients reported fatigue as a common symptom. Patients confirmed SF-7a items were relevant to assessing fatigue, instructions and response options were clear, and its 7-day recall period was appropriate. Higher SF-7a scores were associated with higher disease activity (CDAI and Mayo score) and lower health-related quality of life (IBDQ), confirming known groups validity. The correlation of the SF-7a scale was higher with fatigue-related items. (rs ≥ -0.70) than with items not directly associated with fatigue. Test-retest reliability was moderate to good (0.54-0.89) among patients with stable disease, and responsiveness to change in disease severity was demonstrated from baseline to Week 12. A ≥7point decrease was identified as a reasonable threshold to define clinically meaningful improvement.The SF-7a scale is a valid, reliable, and sensitive measure of fatigue in patients with moderately to severely active IBD and can be used to evaluate treatment response.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, biomarker",,"crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis",4
2023-11-16,37604084,"Would, early, versus late hydroxocobalamin dose intensification treatment, prevent cognitive decline, macular degeneration and ocular disease, in 5 patients with early-onset cblC deficiency?","In early-onset (EO) cblC deficiency (MMACHC), hydroxocobalamin dose-intensification (OHCBL-DI) improved biochemical and clinical outcome. In mammals, Cobalamin is reduced, in a reaction mediated by MMACHC. Pathogenic variants in MMACHC disrupt the synthesis pathway of methyl-cobalamin (MetCbl) and 5'-deoxy-adenosyl-cobalamin (AdoCbl), cofactors for both methionine synthase (MS) and methyl-malonyl-CoA mutase (MCM) enzymes. In 5 patients (pts.), with EO cblC deficiency, biochemical and clinical responses were studied following OHCbl-DI (mean ± SD 6,5 ± 3,3 mg/kg/day), given early, before age 5 months (pts. 1, 2, 3 and 4) or lately, at age 5 years (pt. 5). In all pts., total homocysteine (tHcy), methyl-malonic acid (MMA) and Cob(III)alamin levels were measured. Follow-up was performed during 74/12 years (pts. 1, 2, 3), 33/12 years (pt. 4) and 34/12 years (pt. 5). OHCbl was delivered intravenously or subcutaneously. Mean ± SD serum Cob(III)alamin levels were 42,2 × 106 ± 28, 0 × 106 pg/ml (normal: 200-900 pg/ml). In all pts., biomarkers were well controlled. All pts., except pt. 5, who had poor vision, had central vision, mild to moderate nystagmus, and with peri-foveolar irregularity in pts. 1, 2 and 4, yet none had the classic bulls' eye maculopathy and retinal degeneration characteristic of pts. with EO cblC deficiency. Only pt. 5, had severe cognitive deficiency. Both visual and cognitive functions were better preserved with early than with late OHCBL-DI. OHCBL-DI is suggested to bypass MMACHC, subsequently to be rescued by methionine synthase reductase (MSR) and adenosyl-transferase (ATR) to obtain Cob(I)alamin resulting in improved cognitive and retinal function in pts. with EO cblC deficiency.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinal disease,4
2023-11-16,37966366,Efficacy οf Wet Age-related Macular Degeneration Treatment οn Reading: A Pilot Study Using Eye-movement Analysis.,"Functional vision, as evaluated with silent passage reading speed, improves after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment in patients with wet age-related macular antidegeneration (wAMD), reflecting primarily a concomitant reduction in the number of fixations. Implementing eye movement analysis when reading may better characterize the effectiveness of therapeutic approaches in wAMD.This study aimed to evaluate silent reading performance by means of eye fixation analysis before and after anti-VEGF treatment in wAMD patients.Sixteen wAMD patients who underwent anti-VEGF treatment in one eye and visual acuity (VA) better than 0.5 logMAR served as the AMD group. Twenty adults without ocular pathology served as the control group. Central retinal thickness and near VA were assessed at baseline and 3 to 4 months after their first visit. Reading performance was evaluated using short passages of 0.4-logMAR print size. Eye movements were recorded using EyeLink II video eye tracker. Data analysis included computation of reading speed, fixation duration, number of fixations, and percentage of regressions. Frequency distributions of fixation durations were analyzed with ex-Gaussian fittings.In the AMD group, silent reading speed in the treated eye correlated well with central retinal thickness reduction and improved significantly by an average of 15.9 ± 28.5 words per minute (P = .04). This improvement was accompanied by an average reduction of 0.24 ± 0.38 in fixations per word (P = .03). The corresponding improvement in monocular VA was not statistically significant. Other eye fixation parameters did not change significantly after treatment. No statistically significant differences were found in the control group.Visual acuity tests may underestimate the potential therapeutic effects after anti-VEGF treatment in patients with relatively good acuity who are being treated for wAMD. Evaluating silent reading performance and eye fixation parameters may better characterize the effectiveness of therapeutic approaches in wAMD patients.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,effectiveness,,retinal disease,4

The aim of this study was to present the long-term outcomes of the surgical method used in this study to remove submacular PFCL and to shed light on the advantages and disadvantages compared to other methods.This is a retrospective, single-center, observational study. Patients who underwent surgical intervention due to submacular PFCL were included in this study. The surgical procedural includes internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling, transretinal aspiration of submacular PCFL with a 25/27-gauge soft-tipped cannula, then perfluoropropane (C3F8) gas tamponade, and facedown positioning for 5 days. The long-term anatomical and functional outcomes were evaluated with an ophthalmological examination and optical coherence tomography (OCT).A total of 15 patients with submacular PFCL were included in this study, and the mean age of the patients was 64.33 ± 10.36 years (47 - 83). The localization of submacular PFCL was subfoveal in nine patients (60.00%), non-subfoveal in four patients (26.67%), and both subfoveal and non-subfoveal in two patients (13.33%). The mean time of submacular PFCL diagnosis was 4.86 ± 1.02 weeks (2 - 8) and the mean time of the surgery was 9.80 ± 1.17 weeks (8 - 14). Complete removal of submacular PFCL was achieved in all cases (100%) and no significant treatment-associated complications were observed. The mean follow-up time was 37.60 ± 14.00 months (18 - 60) and the best-corrected visual acuity was significantly improved (p = 0.001). At the end of the follow-up time, prominent ellipsoid zone disruption was observed in six patients (40.00%), while in nine patients (60.00%), there was no prominent ellipsoid zone disruption.The surgical procedural for submacular PFCL removal is a reasonable option and improves visual acuity in the long term without any significant treatment-associated complications.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,retinal disease,4

However, the association between sarcopenia and loss of response (LOR) to biologic agents remains unclear. This study explored such an association in CD patients. This retrospective study included 94 CD patients who received biologic therapy. The skeletal muscle cross-sectional area at the third lumbar was assessed by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging for sarcopenia evaluation. A LOR was defined by fecal calprotectin (FC) < 250 μg/g or >50% reduction from baseline levels or other factors, such as the used agent being replaced by other biologic agents. The association between sarcopenia and LOR was assessed by logistic regression analysis. LOR was observed in 54 patients (57.4%). The prevalence of sarcopenia in the LOR group was higher than that in response group (70.4% vs. 40.0%, p = 0.003). Sarcopenia (odds ratio [OR] = 3.89, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.31-11.54), Montreal L1 type (OR = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.06-0.60), perianal lesions (OR = 4.08, 95% CI: 1.31-12.70), and monocytes percentage (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.02-1.57) at baseline were independent associated factors for LOR. Sarcopenia was also associated with LOR in patients who received infliximab (OR = 3.31, 95% CI: 1.11-9.87). Montreal L1 type, perianal lesions, and monocytes percentage (Model 1), and with additional consideration of sarcopenia (Model 2), were developed to predict LOR. Model 2 showed better performance than Model 1 (area under the curve [AUC] 0.82 vs. 0.75).

2023-11-17,37796497,Presumed Silicone Oil Droplets After Intravitreal Pegcetacoplan Injections.,"Recently, intravitreal pegcetacoplan became the first drug to gain US Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of geographic atrophy associated with nonexudative age-related macular degeneration, but the administration of this medication may be associated with unanticipated posttreatment complications.To assess the prevalence of presumed silicone oil droplets in the vitreous cavity after intravitreal injection of pegcetacoplan.This case series study involved a retrospective record review of all 55 patients treated with intravitreal pegcetacoplan, 0.1 mL in 150-mg/mL solution, between March 24 and June 5, 2023, at a single specialty retina practice. All injections were done using needles from the kit supplied by Apellis Pharmaceuticals on a 1-mL McKesson Luer lock syringe.The presence or absence of presumed silicone bubbles detected during dilated biomicroscopic fundus examination and/or on color fundus photographs, the presence or absence of symptoms, change in visual acuity, and/or increase in intraocular pressure.A total of 62 intravitreal pegcetacoplan injections were given to 55 patients (mean [SD] age, 83.8 [7.8] years; 33 women [60%]) from March 24 to June 5, 2023. Of the 55 patients, 16 (29%; mean [SD] age, 83.8 [7.4] years; 9 women [56%]) had presumed intravitreal silicone droplets discovered 2 to 4 weeks after treatment, 3 of which were documented on color fundus photographs. Of the 16 patients, 14 (88%) were symptomatic for new floaters that they described as persistent, while 2 (13%) were asymptomatic. There were no signs of inflammation or infection, no increases in intraocular pressure, and no changes in visual acuity for all 16 patients.A substantial percentage of patients had symptomatic floaters from presumed intravitreal silicone oil droplets after injections of pegcetacoplan using a McKesson 1-mL Luer lock syringe. These findings support consideration of informing patients of this potential adverse effect, avoiding use of the McKesson syringe, and considering use of silicone-free syringes for pegcetacoplan injections.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,safety,,retinal disease,4

Published studies differ in their conclusions about the epidemiology and etiopathogenesis of neurological EIMs. The aims of this study were to demonstrate the presence and find risk factors of peripheral (somatic and autonomic) neuropathy patients with severe CD on anti-TNFα biological therapy.A clinical examination focusing on detection of peripheral sensor-motor nervous dysfunction (including Sudoscan) and examination of autonomic nervous system dysfunction (using Ewing´s battery tests and spectral analysis) together with laboratory tests and collection of demographic data followed by administration of questionnaires were performed on a total of 30 neurologically asymptomatic outpatients with severe CD on anti-TNFα biological therapy.Peripheral sensor-motor nervous function via clinical neurological examination was pathological in 36.7% and Sudoscan in 33.3% of cases. Statistically significant associations between vibration perception test and age, CD and biological therapy duration, body mass index and Crohn's Disease Activity Index were proved while statistically significant associations between temperature perception test and age and BMI were proved as well. Additionally, a decrease of total protein in a patient´s serum below the physiological cut-off in the 6 months prior to measurement was associated with a pathological result of a Sudoscan. Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy based on Ewing´s battery tests was present in 56.7% of patients, no statistically significant risk factors were found. Our peripheral neuropathy questionnaire correlated with the results of the Sudoscan test and some tests of the clinical examination of peripheral sensor-motor nervous function (discriminatory contact perception test, temperature perception test).This study demonstrated a relatively high prevalence of peripheral (especially autonomic) neuropathy and verified some risk factors for the development of peripheral somatic neuropathy in asymptomatic patients with severe form of CD on anti-TNFα biological therapy.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"safety, biomarker",,crohn's disease,4

The cumulative burden of patients recently diagnosed (<3 years) with UC was also evaluated.""ICONIC"" - Understanding the impact of ulcerative colitis and its associated disease burden on patients - was a noninterventional, multicountry, multicenter study performed in a 2-year follow-up format in adult patients with recently diagnosed UC in 33 countries, regardless of disease severity or treatment. Data collection consisted of five visits, scheduled at approximately 6-month intervals. For the current analysis, patient data from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait were evaluated. The collected data comprised demographics, disease-related data, UC treatment, and healthcare resources, as well as physician- and patient-assessed quality-of-life and disease burden questionnaires. Correlations between selected questionnaire scores were performed using Spearman's rho.Disease severity at baseline and throughout the study was slightly less favorable in this country analysis compared with the global study cohort. Disease burden was assessed by PRISM and improved within 24 months.The detected moderate correlation between PRISM and other assessment methods supports the validity of PRISM.

2023-11-18,37960328,Treatment of Active Crohn's Disease in Children Using Partial Enteral Nutrition Combined with a Modified Crohn's Disease Exclusion Diet: A Pilot Prospective Cohort Trial on Clinical and Endoscopic Outcomes.,"Partial enteral nutrition (PEN) coupled with the Crohn's disease (CD) exclusion diet (CDED) was shown to be effective in inducing clinical remission in paediatric CD. There are currently no robust data on the endoscopic outcomes of PEN. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and endoscopic rates of remission after PEN combined with a modified CDED (mCDED) adjusted to the local cuisine in comparison with exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) for the induction of remission.Between June 2017 and February 2021, a prospective cohort study on children with active CD, treated with PEN + mCDED or EEN, was performed at a single tertiary centre.During the study period, 54 patients were screened and 15 were excluded according to the exclusion criteria, with six patients excluded in the first two days due to intolerance of the enteral formula. Fourteen patients were included in the PEN and 19 in the EEN group. They were assessed at Weeks 0, 1, 3 and 6, using clinical and laboratory parameters. Endoscopy was performed at Weeks 0 and 6. Clinical remission rates per protocol analysis were 84.6% in the PEN group and 81.3% in the EEN group (p = 0.99). At Week 6, an endoscopic response (a decline in the Simple Endoscopic Score for CD (SES-CD) > 50%) was observed in 84.6% of patients on PEN and in 68.8% on EEN treatment (p = 0.41). Endoscopic remission (SES-CD ≤ 2) was achieved in 53.8% of patients in the PEN group and in 50.0% in the EEN group (p = 0.99), while the mucosal healing rates (SES-CD = 0) were 38.5% with PEN and 43.8% with EEN (p = 0.99). A significant decline in the clinical and endoscopic activity scores was observed in both groups.Our study suggests that PEN + mCDED could be effective in inducing endoscopic remission and mucosal healing in active paediatric CD patients.

2023-11-20,37247230,Peripapillary Vitreous Traction Syndrome: Expanding the Spectrum of Anterior Optic Neuropathies.,"Peripapillary vitreous traction (PVT) occurring without any underlying eye disease has been contemplated as a distinct entity from nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) for many years and is sometimes difficult to differentiate from classical NAION. We report 6 new cases to analyze the clinical features of PVT syndrome that would expand the clinical spectrum of anterior optic neuropathies.Prospective case series.PVT syndrome seems to affect optic discs with a small area with a small cup-to-disc (C/D) ratio. The C/D ratio does not significantly increase in the chronic stage, as in NAION. Vitreous traction without detachment can either lead to mild retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) injury with attendant ganglion cell layer/inner plexiform layer (GCL/IPL) thinning in 29% or no injury at all in 71%. Eighty-six percent had good visual acuity (VA) and had no relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD), whereas 14% had a transient RAPD; 71% had no color defect. Vitreous detachment after a period of severe and persistent traction can lead to more damage to the optic nerve head and RNFL that may look like NAION. Our hypothesized mechanically induced injury to the superficial optic nerve head may not lead to much visual impairment. In our study, no further therapeutic interventions were required.Based on our analysis of previously published cases and our own prospective case series of 6 patients, the PVT syndrome falls within the spectrum of anterior optic neuropathies, often affecting small optic discs with a small C/D ratio. Vitreous traction can lead to a partial or complete anterior optic neuropathy.

2023-11-20,37634654,Coronary artery calcium scoring for cardiovascular risk assessment in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with higher incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Data investigating the role of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring in identifying subclinical atherosclerotic disease in IBD patients is scarce.Using data obtained from the CLARIFY registry, a prospective study of no-charge coronary artery calcium (CAC) testing at University Hospitals, we reviewed patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) who underwent CAC scoring from 2014 to 2020. We investigated the concordance between CAC risk and 10-year estimated ASCVD risk by AHA/ACC pooled cohort equation using pre-established thresholds for statin prescription (CAC≥100, 10-year ASCVD risk ≥7.5%). We additionally investigated the association between CAC, preventive therapy initiation and Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE).A total of 369 patients with IBD were included (174 UC, 195 CD), with median age of 60 years. The median CAC score was 14.9 with no significant difference between UC and CD (P = .76). Overall, 151 (41%) had CAC of 0, 108 (29%) had CAC 1-99, 61 (17%) had CAC 100 to 399, and 49 (13%) had CAC ≥400 with no difference in CAC distribution between CD and UC (P = .17). There was no difference in median CAC between IBD or age/sex-matched controls (P = .34). Approximately half of the patients (52%) with IBD had 10-year estimated ASCVD risk of 7.5% or higher. Among patients with ASCVD risk <7.5% (n = 163), 29 (18%) had CAC≥100 and among patients with ASCVD risk ≥7.5% (n = 178), 102 (57%) had CAC <100. There was no difference between CAC<100 vs CAC≥100 with respect to CRP, use of immunosuppressive or amino-salicylate therapy, IBD severity or complications. CAC score (AUROC 0.67 [0.56-0.78]), but not PCE ASCVD risk (AUROC 0.60 [0.48-0.73]), was predictive of MACE. The best cut-off for CAC score was 76 (sensitivity = 60%, specificity = 69%), and was associated with 4-fold increase in MACE (Hazard Ratio 4.0 [2.0-8.1], P < .001).Subclinical atherosclerosis, as evaluated by CAC scoring, is prevalent in patients with IBD, and is associated with cardiovascular events.

2023-11-20,37709606,Outcomes after aortic coarctation repair in neonates weighing less than 2000 g.,"Preterm birth is common in children with congenital heart disease. However, data on how to manage low-birth-weight infants with aortic coarctation are scarce and outcomes are poorly reported. Surgery is often delayed in these infants because gaining weight is supposed to improve mortality and to reduce the risk for recoarctation.All infants weighing less than 2000 g who underwent repair for aortic coarctation at our institution between January 2017 and December 2020 were included in a retrospective study. Baseline characteristics, medical and surgical management, and outcomes, including recoarctation, death, and complications of preterm birth, were analyzed.A total of 15 patients had coarctation repair at a median age of 15 days and at a median weight of 1585 g. Infants with a birth weight <1200 g were operated on later and did not have higher recoarctation rates compared to those with a birth weight >1200 g. The recoarctation rate was 26.6% and one infant died of an extracardiac cause. Concerning prematurity-related complications, we observed 40% of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, 40% of intraventricular hemorrhage, and 27% of retinopathy of prematurity. These complications were more prevalent in children with a birth weight of <1200 g.Delaying surgery beyond 15 days to gain weight does not appear to decrease the risk of recoarctation and may be deleterious in low-birth-weight infants who are exposed for a longer period to risk factors of prematurity-related complications.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,retinopathy,4

The Macular Disease Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (MacTSQ) was administered to patients 6 months after the switch.Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was maintained 6 months after the switch, while the mean (± standard error) central foveal thickness 6 months after the switch (272 ± 14 μm) decreased significantly compared to the time of the switch (372 ± 20 μm) (p < 0.001). The interval between injections 6 months after the switch was 10.45 ± 0.44 weeks, a significant extension from 6.72 ± 0.34 weeks at the switch (p = 0.002). The MacTSQ total score (58.8 ± 1.7) in eyes with a BCVA of 20/40 and better 6 months after the switch was significantly higher compared to that in eyes with a BCVA worse than 20/40 (48.2 ± 1.5) (p < 0.001). The MacTSQ total score (56.8 ± 1.8) in eyes in which a 4 weeks extension of the injection interval was achieved was significantly higher than (49.5 ± 1.9) in eyes without (p < 0.001).Switching to faricimab with a TAE regimen seems to maintain the BCVA and extend the injection interval in patients with nAMD, resulting in enhanced satisfaction.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,effectiveness,,retinal disease,4

Despite encouraging data reporting vaccine safety and low IBD flare rates in adults with IBD, vaccine hesitancy was demonstrated to be high in families of children with IBD. We aimed to find out whether TG is increased in children with IBD as compared to healthy controls and whether TG parameters show significant changes following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination.In this observational case-control study, 38 children with IBD (CD:18, UC: 20) aged 12-18 years and 62 healthy age-and sex-matched children were enrolled. Blood was collected before the first dose and 2-6 weeks after the second dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) mRNA vaccine dose. Blood cell counts, fibrinogen, inflammatory markers (hsCRP, ferritin), anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels were investigated, TG assay was carried-out using platelet-poor plasma. Detailed clinical parameters including disease activity scores (PUCAI, PCDAI) were registered pre-and post- vaccination. A guided questionnaire was used to collect data on adverse reactions (AEs) post- vaccination.Baseline TG parameters did not differ between patients and controls. Endogenous thrombin potential showed a significant positive correlation with markers of inflammation and with PCDAI. Inflammatory parameters and TG did not increase in patients and controls post-vaccination. Vaccination significantly increased antibody levels in all three investigated groups, but post-vaccination anti-SARS-CoV-2 S IgG/IgM levels were below the 5th percentile value of healthy children in more than one third of patients. Those receiving TNFα inhibitor therapy presented significantly lower SARS-CoV-2 S IgG/IgM levels as compared to patients on other immunosuppressive regimens. Systemic AEs did not differ between patients and controls while lower rate of local symptoms was found post-vaccination in children with IBD. Only 2 IBD flares were detected 2-6 weeks after the second dose of vaccination.Our study is the first to support the safety and efficacy of anti-SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 vaccination in children with IBD with detailed pre-and post-vaccination laboratory data including TG.

The oldest patient was 75 years old, and the youngest was 8 years old. These cases represented 51 eyes with severe eyeball rupture and 10 eyes with severe, complicated ocular trauma, which became silicone oil-dependent after the operation. These patients received FCVB implants, and data regarding their visual acuity, intraocular pressure, changes in eye axis, cornea, retina, and FCVB state were recorded after the operation.In all patients, the FCVB was properly positioned and well supported with the retina. All 61 patients cleared a follow-up window of 1-36 months with no reports of important changes in their visual acuity. Among the patients, 91.8% reported normal intraocular pressure, the retinal reattachment rate reached 100%, and the eyeball atrophy control rate reached 100%. There was no report of rupture of the FCVB, allergies to silicone, intraocular infection, intraocular hemorrhage, silicone oil emulsification, or sympathetic ophthalmia.Foldable capsular vitreous bodies (FCVBs) designed to mimic natural vitreous bodies are suitable as long-term ocular implants that can provide sustained support for the retina without the need for any special postoperative postures. Their barrier function may effectively prolong the retention time of the tamponade and prevent various complications caused by direct contact of the eye tissues with the tamponade.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"safety, effectiveness",,retinal disease,4

Here, we present a statistical analysis plan for secondary Bayesian analyses of the pragmatic, sufficiently powered multinational, trial-SafeBoosC III-evaluating the benefits and harms of cerebral oximetry monitoring plus a treatment guideline versus usual care for such infants.The SafeBoosC-III trial is an investigator-initiated, open-label, randomised, multinational, pragmatic, phase III clinical trial with a parallel-group design. The trial randomised 1601 infants, and the frequentist analyses were published in April 2023. The primary outcome is a dichotomous composite outcome of death or severe brain injury. The exploratory outcomes are major neonatal morbidities associated with neurodevelopmental impairment later in life: (1) bronchopulmonary dysplasia; (2) retinopathy of prematurity; (3) late-onset sepsis; (4) necrotising enterocolitis; and (5) number of major neonatal morbidities (count of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, and severe brain injury). The primary Bayesian analyses will use non-informed priors including all plausible effects. The models will use a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler with 1 chain, a sampling of 10,000, and at least 25,000 iterations for the burn-in period. In Bayesian statistics, such analyses are referred to as 'posteriors' and will be presented as point estimates with 95% credibility intervals (CrIs), encompassing the most probable results based on the data, model, and priors selected. The results will be presented as probability of any benefit or any harm, Bayes factor, and the probability of clinical important benefit or harm. Two statisticians will analyse the blinded data independently following this protocol.This statistical analysis plan presents a secondary Bayesian analysis of the SafeBoosC-III trial. The analysis and the final manuscript will be carried out and written after we publicise the primary frequentist trial report. Thus, we can interpret the findings from both the frequentists and Bayesian perspective.

2023-11-20,37978475,High myopia is protective against diabetic retinopathy in the participants of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.,"To investigate the association of subjects with refractive error and diabetic retinopathy (DR) in the United States comparing results between different race groups.All data were derived from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2005 to 2008. The data were divided into four groups (emmetropia, mild myopia, high myopia, hypertropia) according to the spherical equivalent (SE), and those who met the enrollment conditions were selected as the study subjects. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between refractive error and diabetic retinopathy risk.A total of 1317 participants were included in the study, including 331 participants with diabetic retinopathy, and 986 without diabetic retinopathy. After adjustment for potential confounders, subjects with high myopia were associated with a lower risk of diabetic retinopathy. The odds ratio (OR) was 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI): (0.20-0.96), P-value = 0.040 in the multivariate regression analysis. Subgroup analyses showed that subjects with high myopia in the non-Hispanic Black group were associated with decreased odds of diabetic retinopathy. (OR was 0.20, and 95% CI: 0.04-0.95, P-value = 0.042).The results show that high myopia is associated with diabetic retinopathy in diabetic patients.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,effectiveness,,retinopathy,4
2023-11-20,37978997,Extended versus limited mesenteric excision for operative Crohn's disease: 30-Day outcomes from the ACS-NSQIP database.,"Recent studies have suggested that extended mesenteric excision (ME) may reduce surgical reintervention in Crohn's Disease (CD), but there remains clinical concerns regarding potential peri-operative morbidity. This retrospective study compares 30-day perioperative morbidity between limited and extended ME in segmental colectomies for CD.Using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement (ACS-NSQIP) colectomy-specific database, all patients with CD undergoing segmental colectomy for non-malignant indications between 2014-2019 were included. A lymph node harvest of 12 or more nodes was used as a surrogate for extended ME. The primary outcome was NSQIP major morbidity. Secondary outcomes included abdominal complications and perioperative bleeding.Of 3,709 patients included from the ACS-NSQIP database, 3,087 underwent limited ME and 622 underwent extended ME. On univariate analysis, those with limited mesenteric excision were less likely to be anemic (46.1% vs 55.0%, p < 0.001) and have undergone an open surgery (44.7% vs 34.7%, p < 0.001). On univariate comparison of limited and extended ME, there was no significant difference in major morbidity. On multiple logistic regression, controlling for age, sex, BMI, smoking, preoperative sepsis, preoperative anemia, surgical approach, emergency surgery, stoma creation, bowel preparation, and immunosuppression, the extent of ME was not an independent predictor of NSQIP major morbidity (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.84-1.44). Likewise, the extent of ME was not associated with an increase in abdominal complications (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76-1.19) or post-operative bleeding (OR 1.89, 95% CI 0.75-1.53).Extended ME for CD was not associated with an increase in 30-day perioperative major morbidity.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,safety,,crohn's disease,4
2023-11-21,36720210,Short-Term Safety and Efficacy of Intravitreal Brolucizumab Injections for Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration: A Multicenter Retrospective Real-World Study.,"The aim of the study was to determine the short-term real-world safety and efficacy of intravitreal brolucizumab injections in Korean patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD).This multicenter retrospective study involved 294 eyes (treatment naïve 20 eye [6.8%] and nontreatment naïve 274 eyes [93.2%]) of 290 patients from 13 hospitals or retinal centers in South Korea. Patients with nAMD who received brolucizumab injection(s) between April 1 and November 30, 2021, with a follow-up ≥1 month, were included. Primary outcomes were safety, incidence of intraocular inflammation (IOI), and potential risk factors. The secondary outcome was efficacy, i.e., change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and optical coherence tomography-measured macular thickness and retinal fluid.The mean age was 71.63 ± 8.66. The follow-up period was 2.38 ± 0.79 months. The mean number of brolucizumab injections during the follow-up was 1.52 ± 0.58. The overall incidence of IOI was 13.9% (n = 41 eyes). Most IOI cases were of anterior uveitis (8.8%, 26 eyes), followed by retinal vasculitis (2.4%, seven eyes) and occlusive retinal vasculitis (0.3%, one eye). Most eyes showed IOI resolution (n = 40, 97.5%) and BCVA restoration (n = 39, 95.1%) with or without corticosteroid treatment during the follow-up. Age, sex, IOI history, or other anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injection histories were not associated with the occurrence of IOI. However, only thin subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) was associated with the occurrence of IOI (odds ratio = 0.995, p = 0.020). BCVA at 1 month improved from baseline (baseline 0.518 ± 0.356 vs. 1 month 0.503 ± 0.383, p = 0.023), but the improvement was not maintained. Anatomical improvement was significant after 3 months.In Korean patients with nAMD, the incidence of IOI following brolucizumab injections was 13.9%. IOI was well-controlled with or without steroid treatment. Most IOI eyes (95.1%) were restored to the level of vision before. IOI occurrence and occlusive vasculitis was rare. In the short term, brolucizumab injection effectively improved vision at 1 month and dried retinal fluid for 3 months.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"safety, effectiveness",,retinal disease,4
2023-11-21,37245503,Use of Heavy Silicon Oil as Intraocular Tamponade for Inferior Retinal Detachment Complicated by Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy: A Multicentric Experience.,"This is a multicentric study on the use of heavy silicon oil (HSO) as an intraocular tamponade for inferior retinal detachment (RD) complicated by proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR).139 eyes treated for RD with PVR were included in the study. 10 (7.2%) were affected by primary RD with inferior PVR, while 129 (92.8%) were affected by recurrent RD with inferior PVR. 102 eyes (73.9%) had received a silicon oil (SO) tamponade in a previous intervention prior to receiving HSO. Mean follow-up was 36.5 (standard deviation = 32.3) months.The median interval between HSO injection and removal was 4 months (interquartile range: 3). At the time of HSO removal, the retina was attached in 120 eyes (87.6%), whereas in 17 eyes (12.4%), it had re-detached while the HSO was in situ. 32 eyes (23.2%) showed recurrent RD. A subsequent RD relapse was observed in 14.2% of cases with no RD at the time of HSO removal, and in 88.2% if an RD was present at the time of HSO removal. Advancing age showed a positive association with retinal attachment at the end of follow-up, while the risk of RD relapse at the end of the follow-up showed a significant negative association with HSO tamponade duration and with the use of SO rather than air or gas as post-HSO tamponade materials. Mean best corrected visual acuity was 1.1 logarithm of minimum angle of resolution at all follow-up time points. 56 cases (40.3%) needed treatment for elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), with which no clinically relevant variables were associated during follow-up.HSO represents a safe and effective tamponade in cases of inferior RD with PVR. The presence of RD at the time of HSO removal is a negative prognostic factor for the development of a subsequent RD relapse. According to our findings, in cases of RD at the time of HSO removal, a short-term tamponade should definitely be avoided, in favor of SO. Special attention must be paid to the risk of IOP elevation, and patients should be closely monitored.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,retinal disease,4
2023-11-21,37271123,Effects of Perfluorocarbon Use during Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment Surgery on Postoperative Outcomes.,"The aim of this study was to determine whether the use of perfluorocarbon liquid (PFCL) affects the rate of retinal re-attachments after an initial attachment by vitrectomy in eyes with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD).This was a retrospective, observational, multicenter study of 3,446 eyes registered in the Japanese vitreoretinal surgery treatment information database. Of these, 2,648 eyes had undergone vitrectomy as the first surgery for RRD. The re-attachment rates after the primary vitrectomy with or without PFCL were evaluated. In addition, the significance of factors affecting the re-detachments was determined by univariate and multivariate analyses. The measured outcomes were the rates of re-attachments after the primary vitrectomy with or without the use of PFCL.A total of 2,362 eyes in the database were analyzed: 325 had and 2,037 did not have PFCL injected into the vitreous cavity during the vitrectomy. The rate of re-attachments was 91.5% in the PFCL group and 93.2% in the non-PFCL group (p = 0.46, χ2 test). Although there were several risk factors associated with the re-detachments in eyes without PFCL (p &lt; 0.05, Welch's t tests, and Fisher's exact tests), they were not associated in eyes with PFCL use. However, multivariate analyses showed that there was no significant association between the use and the non-use of PFCL in the rate of re-detachments (β = -0.08, p = 0.46).The use of PFCL during the initial vitrectomy for RRD does not affect the rate of re-attachments.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,effectiveness,,retinal disease,4

The HLA-DQA1*05 allele has been shown to increase the risk of immunogenicity to anti-TNF drugs by approximately two-fold. The negative impact of this allele has not been fully investigated for newer biotherapies.whether the presence of the HLA-DQA1*05 allele is associated with a reduction of response to ustekinumab and vedolizumab was investigated.the impact of HLA-DQA1*05 on disease activity in 93 patients with IBD, treated with ustekinumab (n = 39) or vedolizumab (n = 54) was investigated in a retrospective cohort study. Treatment response and remission was assessed at 6 and 12 months for ustekinumab, and up to 18 and 24 months for vedolizumab, using Harvey-Bradshaw index (Crohn's disease) and Mayo score (ulcerative colitis).the HLA-DQA1*05 allele was found in 35.9 % and 38.9 % of patients treated with ustekinumab and vedolizumab, respectively.

2023-11-21,37495083,Trends in the Diagnosed Prevalence and Incidence of Major Eye Diseases in Medicare Part B Fee-for-Service Beneficiaries 68 Years of Age or Older.,"To study contemporary trends in the diagnosed prevalence and incidence of age-related eye diseases among Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) beneficiaries.Analysis of Medicare administrative claims data.Medicare FFS beneficiaries 68 years of age and older from 2005 through 2020 who were enrolled continuously in both Part A and Part B for 3 years, including the index year and a 2-year lookback period.Annual cross-sectional diagnosed prevalence and incidence rates were calculated. Age standardization was performed using the direct standardization method to account for changes in the age structure of the study population. Rates stratified by demographics (age, sex, race, and ethnicity) also were calculated.Annual prevalence and incidence of diagnosed age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR) (among those with diabetes), and glaucoma.At baseline, in 2005, 60% of included beneficiaries were female, 20% were 85 years of age or older, 86% were non-Hispanic White, and one-quarter had a diagnosis of diabetes. From 2005 through 2019, the prevalence of a diagnosis of any of the conditions studied increased from 16.4% (n = 3 628 996) to 17.9% (n = 3 731 281). Diagnosed incidence decreased over this period from 4.9% (n = 954 878) in 2005 to 4.2% in 2019 (n = 757 696). The diagnosed prevalence of AMD increased from 6.8% (n = 1 504 770) to 9.4% (n = 1 965 176); the diagnosed prevalence of any DR among those with diabetes decreased from 9.3% (n = 504 135) to 9.0% (n = 532 859), although the diagnosed prevalence of vision-threatening DR increased from 2.0% to 3.4%; and the diagnosed prevalence of any diagnosed glaucoma decreased from 8.8% (n = 1 951 141) to 8.1% (n = 1 692 837). In 2020, the diagnosed prevalence and incidence of all diagnoses decreased. During the study period, we detected demographic differences in the prevalence and incidence of diagnosis of each condition.This study presents updated data on the prevalence and incidence of diagnosed major chronic, age-related eye diseases among Medicare FFS beneficiaries. Compared with older epidemiologic estimates, we found that the diagnosed prevalence of each condition studied was higher in more recent years.

2023-11-21,37541626,Zellweger Spectrum Disorder: Ophthalmic Findings from a New Natural History Study Cohort and Scoping Literature Review.,"Individuals with Zellweger spectrum disorder (ZSD) manifest a spectrum of clinical phenotypes but almost all have retinal degeneration leading to blindness. The onset, extent, and progression of retinal findings have not been well described. It is crucial to understand the natural history of vision loss in ZSD to define reliable endpoints for future interventional trials. Herein, we describe ophthalmic findings in the largest number of ZSD patients to date.Retrospective review of longitudinal data from medical charts and review of cross-sectional data from the literature.Sixty-six patients with ZSD in the retrospective cohort and 119 patients reported in the literature, divided into 4 disease phenotypes based on genotype or clinical severity.We reviewed ophthalmology records collected from the retrospective cohort (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01668186) and performed a scoping review of the literature for ophthalmic findings in patients with ZSD. We extracted available ophthalmic data and analyzed by age and disease severity.Visual acuity (VA), posterior and anterior segment descriptions, nystagmus, refraction, electroretinography findings, visual evoked potentials, and OCT results and images.Visual acuity was worse at younger ages in those with severe disease compared with older patients with intermediate to mild disease for all 78 participants analyzed, with a median VA of 0.93 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (Snellen 20/320). Longitudinal VA data revealed slow loss over time and legal blindness onset at an average age of 7.8 years. Funduscopy showed retinal pigmentation, macular abnormalities, small or pale optic discs, and attenuated vessels with higher prevalence in milder severity groups and did not change with age. Electroretinography waveforms were diminished in 91% of patients, 46% of which were extinguished and did not change with age. OCT in milder patients revealed schitic changes in 18 of 23 individuals (age range 1.8 to 30 years), with evolution or stable macular edema.In ZSD, VA slowly deteriorates and is associated with disease severity, serial electroretinography is not useful for documenting vision loss progression, and intraretinal schitic changes may be common. Multiple systematic measures are required to assess retinal dystrophy accurately in ZSD, including functional vision measures.Proprietary or commercial disclosure may be found in the Footnotes and Disclosures at the end of this article.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinal disease,4

The overall age of patients at CLV diagnosis was 30.7 ± 16.9 years (1-83). Twenty-one patients (31%) had unilateral CLV, and the most common retinal features were telangiectasia, exudates, and exudative retinal detachment (ERD) affecting the inferior and temporal retina. Macular edema/schisis was observed in 26% of the eyes, and ERD was observed in 63% of the eyes. Fifty-four patients (81%) had genetic testing, 40 of whom were molecularly solved. Sixty-six eyes (58%) were observed, 17 eyes (15%) were treated with a single modality, and 30 eyes (27%) had a combined approach. Thirty-five eyes (31%) were ""good responders,"" 42 eyes (37%) were ""poor responders,"" 22 eyes (19%) had low vision at baseline and were only observed, and 12 eyes (11%) did not have longitudinal assessment. Twenty-one observed eyes (62%) responded well versus 14 (33%) treated eyes. Final best-corrected visual acuity was significantly worse than baseline (P = 0.002); 40 patients (60%) lost 15 ETDRS letters or more over follow-up in 1 or both eyes, and 21 patients (31%) progressed to more advanced stages of visual impairment.Inherited retinal disease-related CLV is rare, sporadic, and mostly bilateral; there is no gender predominance, and it can occur in diverse types of IRD at any point of the disease, with a mean onset in the fourth decade of life. Patients with IRD-related CLV who have decreased initial visual acuity, ERD, CLV changes affecting 2 or more retinal quadrants, and CRB1-retinopathy may be at higher risk of a poor prognosis.Proprietary or commercial disclosure may be found in the Footnotes and Disclosures at the end of this article.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,retinal disease,4

In this exploratory study, we investigated associations between PFAS levels in neonatal dried blood spots and retinoblastoma risk.This study included 501 retinoblastoma cases born from 1983 to 2011 and 899 controls frequency-matched by birth year (20:1 matching ratio), born to 755 US-born and 366 Mexico-born mothers in California. Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perflurooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) feature intensities were identified from neonatal blood spots from California newborn Genetic Disease Screening Program. Using logistic regression, we assessed whether an interquartile range (IQR) increase of PFAS levels or having above-mean levels of PFAS in blood affects retinoblastoma risk overall or its subtypes (i.e., unilateral, bilateral). We assessed children of US-born and Mexico-born mothers, separately.Among all children, above-mean PFOS levels at birth increased the odds of retinoblastoma overall by 29% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.00, 1.67) and unilateral retinoblastoma by 42% (95% CI: 1.03, 1.97). For children of Mexico-born mothers, we estimated the highest odds of retinoblastoma overall (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.67; 95% CI: 1.06, 2.66) and bilateral retinoblastoma (aOR: 2.06; 95% CI: 1.12, 3.92) with above-mean PFOS levels. Among children of US-born mothers, higher PFOS levels increased the odds of unilateral retinoblastoma by 15% (95% CI: 0.99, 1.35) for each IQR increase and by 71% among children with above-mean PFOS levels (95% CI: 1.04, 2.90). In addition, for children of US-born mothers, PFOA increased the odds of retinoblastoma overall (aOR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.00, 2.02 for above-mean levels, aOR: 1.06; 95% CI: 0.98, 1.16 per IQR increase).

Direct exchange of PFCL for silicone oil is recommended to reduce retinal slippage when compared with fluid-air exchange, but it is commonly regarded as a difficult procedure. We describe our technique for direct PFCL-silicone oil exchange using a 20-gauge drainage cannula, reliably avoiding the complications of retinal slippage and high intraoperative intraocular pressure.We present a consecutive case series of patients undergoing PFCL-oil exchange and explain, using Poiseuille's equation for laminar fluid flow through a cannula, the rationale for using a 20-gauge drainage cannula rather than smaller gauges to avoid high intraocular pressure.Twenty-six patients underwent PFCL-oil exchange from February 1, 2019, to September 30, 2019. There was no intraoperative retinal slippage or pressure-related complications. Postoperatively 20 patients underwent oil removal. Six suffered retinal redetachment, and 14 remained attached. The vision postoil removal ranged from 6/6 to hand movements.We are confident that the PFCL-oil exchange technique described here is reliable and safe.

Then, subretinal balanced salt solution was injected using a 38-gauge subretinal needle to create multiple blebs around the folded retina. Finally, 20% sulfur hexafluoride gas was used for tamponade. Follow-up was conducted for a minimum of 6 months.Vision improved from preoperative mean best-corrected visual acuity logMAR 1.44 (20/550) ± 0.32 to postoperative mean best-corrected visual acuity logMAR 0.75 (20/112) ± 0.17 ( P value = 0.0208) after intervention. There was a reduction in the macular fold. Postoperatively, a macular hole with retinal detachment developed in one of five (20%) eyes.The novel technique of vitrectomy with combined internal limiting membrane peeling and subretinal balanced salt solution injection is visually rewarding in treating congenital falciform folds.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,retinal disease,4
2023-11-22,36731110,Intraocular Fibrin Glue to Lower the Risk of Postoperative Vitreous Hemorrhage After Diabetic Pars Plana Vitrectomy.,"To investigate the use of intraocular fibrin glue to lower the risk of vitreous hemorrhage (VH) after pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) in eyes with diabetic VH or traction retinal detachment.A matched, case-control, single-surgeon, pilot study of patients undergoing PPV for diabetic VH or traction retinal detachment with versus without fibrin glue was performed.Thirty-nine patients (13 glue and 26 control patients) were included. In the glue group, mean (SD) logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution visual acuity (Snellen) significantly improved from 1.53 (0.6) (20/678) to 0.99 (0.9) (20/195) at postoperative month 6 ( P = 0.03). In the control group, mean logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution visual acuity also improved from 1.45 (0.8) (20/564) to 1.17 (0.9) (20/296) at postoperative Month 6 ( P = 0.3). Persistent post-PPV VH was similar between the 2 groups (15.4% in both groups, P > 0.99). However, early recurrent VH (<3 months post-PPV) was seen in 34.6% in the control group and none in the glue group ( P = 0.02). No intraocular inflammatory events were seen in the glue group.Intraocular fibrin glue may be a safe adjuvant in diabetic vitrectomy and may reduce the rate of early recurrent postoperative VH.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,retinopathy,4
2023-11-22,37767910,Therapeutic drug monitoring of methotrexate in patients with Crohn's disease.,"Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) has the potential to improve efficacy and diminish side effects. Measuring methotrexate-polyglutamate (MTX-PG) in erythrocytes might enable TDM for methotrexate in patients with Crohn's disease (CD).To investigate the relationship between MTX-PGs and methotrexate drug survival, efficacy and toxicity METHODS: In a multicentre prospective cohort study, patients with CD starting subcutaneous methotrexate without biologics were included and followed for 12 months. Primary outcome was subcutaneous methotrexate discontinuation or requirement for step-up therapy. Secondary outcomes included faecal calprotectin (FCP), Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI), hepatotoxicity and gastrointestinal intolerance. Erythrocyte MTX-PGs were analysed at weeks 8, 12, 24 and 52 or upon treatment discontinuation.We included 80 patients with CD (mean age 55 ± 13y, 35% male) with a median FCP of 268 μg/g (IQR 73-480). After the 12-month visit, 21 patients (26%) were still on subcutaneous methotrexate monotherapy. Twenty-one patients stopped because of disease activity, 29 because of toxicity, and four for both reasons. Five patients ended study participation or stopped methotrexate for another reason. A higher MTX-PG3 concentration was associated with a higher rate of methotrexate drug survival (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75-0.99), lower FCP (β -3.7, SE 1.3, p < 0.01) and with biochemical response (FCP ≤250 if baseline >250 μg/g; OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0-1.3). Higher MTX-PGs were associated with less gastrointestinal intolerance. There was no robust association between MTX-PGs and HBI or hepatotoxicity.Higher MTX-PG3 concentrations are related to better methotrexate drug survival and decreased FCP levels. Therefore, MTX-PG3 could be used for TDM if a target concentration can be established.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,crohn's disease,4
2023-11-22,37983211,Relationship between ocular surface temperature and 0.1% cyclosporine a in dry eye syndrome with meibomian gland dysfunction.,"To determine the relationship between ocular surface temperature (OST) and 0.1% cyclosporine A in patients with dry eye syndrome and meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). This study retrospectively analyzed 35 eyes from 18 patients with dry eye disease (DED) and MGD, who were divided into two groups. Group 1 was treated with artificial tears, and eyelid margin scrubs without anti-inflammatory eye drops, while group 2 received the same treatment as group 1 along with 0.1% cyclosporine A. The ocular surface disease index (OSDI), tear meniscus height (TMH), noninvasive tear breakup time (NIBUT), lipid layer thickness (LLT), meibum quality score (MQS), and OST were measured at baseline and 1 month later. Nineteen and 16 eyes were included in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Both groups showed a significant decrease in OSDI and OST; however, the decrease was more significant in group 2. No other significant differences in TMH, NIBUT, and LLT were observed; however, MQS significantly differed in group 2. This study found that 0.1% CsA administration can relieve symptoms in patients with DED and MGD although there were no definite keratitis clues, such as epithelial erosion. In addition, the conjunctival temperature showed a correlation with symptom improvement.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,effectiveness,,dry eye,4
2023-11-22,37985889,Association of CD4-positive cell infiltration with response to vedolizumab in patients with ulcerative colitis.,"Not all patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) respond initially to treatment with biologic agents, and predicting their efficacy prior to treatment is difficult. Vedolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against alpha 4 beta 7 (α4β7) integrin, suppresses immune cell migration by blocking the interaction between α4β7 integrin and mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1. Reports about histological features that predict vedolizumab efficacy are scarce. So, we examined the association between histological features and vedolizumab efficacy. This was a multicenter, retrospective study of patients with UC treated with vedolizumab. Biopsy specimens taken from the colonic mucosa prior to vedolizumab induction were used, and the areas positively stained for CD4, CD68, and CD45 were calculated. Clinical and histological features were compared between those with and without remission at week 22, and the factors associated with clinical outcomes were identified. We enrolled 42 patients. Patients with a high CD4+ infiltration showed a better response to vedolizumab [odds ratio (OR) = 1.44, P = 0.014]. The concomitant use of corticosteroids and high Mayo scores had a negative association with the vedolizumab response (OR = 0.11, P = 0.008 and OR = 0.50, P = 0.009, respectively).

2023-11-22,37986021,The IBD-FITT study - moderate-intensity exercise for patients with inflammatory bowel disease with moderate disease activity: an open-label randomized controlled trial.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis are chronic autoimmune lifelong diseases with fluctuating activity over time. The treatment includes medical therapy and surgery, however, there is no definite cure. Therefore, the quest for new and supplementary treatment options is imperative to improve patients' general health and quality of life. Physical activity and exercise have been suggested to be elements in both the prevention and supplementary treatment of IBD; however, this is based on limited underpowered trials. Thus, the role of exercise as a treatment option still has to be settled. We aim to investigate the effect of a 12-week exercise intervention in adult patients with moderately active IBD on three categories of outcomes (1) disease-specific health-related quality of life (IBDQ); (2) general health status of the patients, i.e., waist circumference, disease activity by clinical scorings systems (Harvey Bradshaw Index, Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index), blood pressure, blood lipids, and non-disease specific quality of life (EQ5D) scores; and (3) explorative outcomes on biomarkers (C-reactive protein and fecal calprotectin) plus different biomarkers of immunology (cytokine panel).We will apply a superiority design in this open-label randomized clinical trial including 150 patients equally allocated to intervention and usual care. The intervention will be based on a 12-week aerobic exercise program and will include two supervised exercise sessions of 60 min per week, combined with one weekly home training session. We have defined a moderate exercise level as 60-80% of patients' maximum heart rate. The patients in the intervention group will also be offered an online video lesson of 15-25 min on lifestyle guidance, and the same online video lesson will be offered in the comparator group. Questionnaires on quality of life will be forwarded electronically both at inclusion and at the end of the study, and the patients will have blood samples, and fecal samples for calprotectin at baseline, weeks 4 and 8, as well as after 12 weeks (study end).This will be a clinical trial investigating the effect of exercise on patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. This trial will add to the evidence on the possible effect of exercise and might clarify whether exercise can benefit as a supplementary treatment addendum. Thus, the trial may provide a new patient-active disease management approach.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04816812. Date of first registration: March 23, 2021.",no,yes,no,human RCT,"effectiveness, biomarker",,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",4
2023-11-22,37986246,Acupuncture for aqueous deficiency dry eye: a randomized controlled trial.,"To compare the clinical efficacy and safety of acupuncture and sodium hyaluronate eye drop in the treatment of aqueous deficiency dry eye.A total of 60 patients (120 eyes) with aqueous deficiency dry eye were randomly divided into an observation group (30 cases, 1 case dropped out) and a control group (30 cases, 1 case dropped out). In the control group, sodium hyaluronate eye drop were used, one drop at a time, 4 times a day, for 14 consecutive days. In the observation group, acupuncture was applied at bilateral Shangjingming (Extra), Cuanzhu (BL 2), Sizhukong (TE 23), Taiyang (EX-HN 5), and Tongziliao (GB 1) , once a day, treatment for 6 days with the interval of 1 day was required, for 14 consecutive days. The tear meniscus height (TMH), Schirmer Ⅰ test (SⅠT), ocular surface disease index (OSDI) score, non-invasive tear break-up time (NIBUT), and corneal fluorescein sodium staining (FLS) score were compared between the two groups before and after treatment, and the safety of the treatment of the two groups was observed.Compared with those before treatment, after treatment, TMH, SⅠT and NIBUT were increased (P<0.01, P<0.05), and FLS scores were decreased (P<0.01) in the two groups; the score of OSDI was reduced (P<0.01) in the observation group. After treatment, in the observation group, TMH and SⅠT were higher than those in the control group (P<0.01), and the score of OSDI was lower than that in the control group (P<0.01). No adverse reactions and adverse events were observed in the two groups.Acupuncture and sodium hyaluronate eye drop can both effectively treat aqueous deficiency dry eye, acupuncture has obvious advantages in improving TMH and basic tear secretion, and reducing the subjective symptoms of patients.

This study aimed to evaluate sleep disorders and symptomatic dry eye (DE) occurrence. This study was a cross-sectional survey of 1393 participants in China. The insomnia severity index (ISI) Questionnaire was used to evaluate sleep quality, and the ocular surface disease index (OSDI) questionnaire was used to assess DE symptoms. Subjects were divided into 2 groups based on subjects with and without symptomatic DE. The patients who had DE (10.48 ± 7.27) had substantially lower ISI scores compared to those without DE (3.57 ± 5.10) (P = .003). Furthermore, each ISI item and total ISI score was significantly correlated with OSDI dry eye severity and total OSDI dry eye score. Higher prevalence of insomnia was found in participants with symptomatic DE, and insomnia correlated significantly with DE symptoms.

Despite the wide range of current treatment modalities targeting multiple aspects of DED, the available DED management literature is quite heterogeneous, rendering evaluation or comparison of treatment outcomes hard or almost impossible. There is still a shortage of well-designed, large-scale, nonsponsored, randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating long-term safety and efficacy of many targeted therapies individually or used in combination, in the treatment of identified subgroups of patients with DED. This review focuses on the treatment modalities in DED management and aims to reveal the current evidence available as deduced from the outcomes of RCTs.",no,yes,no,human RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,dry eye,4

Secondary endpoints were to assess symptomatic efficacy, adverse effects and factors associated with complete combined clinical-radiological response (deep remission).After marketing the product in France, all first patients treated consecutively were included. A complete clinical response was defined by a complete closure of all external openings with no discharge on pressure. A complete radiological response (MRI), evaluated at least after six months of follow-up, was defined by a completely fibrotic sequela without abscess. A deep remission was defined as the association of a complete clinical response with a complete radiological response.A total of 43 patients were included (M/F: 22/21, median age 37 [26-45] years). The fistulas were already drained with seton(s) and were on biologic treatment. After a median follow-up of 383 (359-505) days, 28 (65%) patients showed a clinical response (22 complete and 6 partial) and 16 (37%) achieved a deep remission. The Perineal Disease Activity Index decreased significantly after treatment: 39 (91%) patients reported symptomatic improvement in terms of discharge, pain, and induration, and 28 (65%) no longer had any perineal symptoms. No severe adverse events were reported. A short history of Crohn's disease <3 years was significantly associated with deep remission (OD 4.5 [1.0-19.1], p = 0.04).Darvadstrocel injection resulted in a clinical response for two thirds of patients and deep remission for one third.

2023-11-23,37989837,The effect of leucocytosis on retinopathy of prematurity.,"Postnatal leukocytosis reflects the general condition of inflammatory. Infection and inflammatory reaction have been proven to affect the occurrence of ROP and other visual dysfunction. Infants with a gestational age of < 28 weeks who were less than three days of age and admitted to the hospital between September 2015 and March 2021 were included in the study. Infants with a white blood cell (WBC) count ≥ 30 × 109/L were assigned to the leucocytosis group (n = 82). Gestational age- and weight-matched infants without leucocytosis were included as a control group (n = 85). The incidence and prognosis of ROP in preterm infants were compared between the groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to analyse the correlation between the WBC count and severe ROP. Compared to the infants in the control group, those in the leucocytosis group had lower 1-min Apgar scores (p < 0.001); higher C-reactive protein (p < 0.001) and procalcitonin (p < 0.001); and higher incidences of intracranial haemorrhage (p = 0.007), leukomalacia (p = 0.045), sepsis (p = 0.006), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (p = 0.017). The maternal age was higher in the leucocytosis group (p < 0.001). After adjusting for gestational age at 45 weeks, the incidence of severe ROP (p = 0.001) and the requirement for ranibizumab injections (p = 0.004) were higher in the leucocytosis group. The cut-off WBC count was determined to be 19.1 × 109/L, with a sensitivity of 88.6%, a specificity of 77.3%, and an area under the curve of 0.941 (95% confidence interval: 0.904-0.978) for the detection of severe ROP.

This study aims to identify the risk factors for care abandonment across a multinational set of patients.A prospective, observational study of 692 patients from 11 RB centres in 10 countries was conducted from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify risk factors associated with higher rates of care abandonment.Logistic regression showed a higher risk of abandoning care based on country (high-risk countries include Bangladesh (OR=18.1), Pakistan (OR=45.5) and Peru (OR=9.23), p<0.001), female sex (OR=2.39, p=0.013) and advanced clinical stage (OR=4.22, p<0.001). Enucleation as primary treatment was not associated with a higher risk of care abandonment (OR=0.59, p=0.206).Country, advanced disease and female sex were all associated with higher rates of abandonment. In this analysis, enucleation as the primary treatment was not associated with abandonment.

Main outcome measure was VI, defined as vision in the best eye of <6/24. We conducted a multivariable logistic regression for VI as primary outcome of interest, controlling for age, sex, type of diabetes, baseline DR grade, ethnicity and index of multiple deprivation (IMD).Mean age was 64.5 (SD 13.6) years; 61% of patients were men; and 31% of South Asian ethnicity. There were 68 patients with CVI during the study period, and 84% (272/325) of patients with VI did not have CVI after a mean follow-up of 1.87 (SD ±0.86) years. Older age showed a positive association with VI (OR per decade rise 1.88, 95% CI 1.70 to 2.08; p=1.8×10-34). Men had a lower risk of VI (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.79, p=6.0×10-5), and less deprivation had a graded inverse association with VI (OR per IMD category increase 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.93, p value for linear trend 0.002).The majority of people with vision impairment are not registered at the point of care, which could translate to underestimation of diabetes-related VI and all-cause VI at a national level if replicated at other centres.

Group 1 underwent 360° ELR and group 2 received focal ELR. Postoperative vision and complications, including redetachment rate, macular oedema and epiretinal membrane formation, were also compared.A total of 72 patients, 42 in group 1 and 30 in group 2, were analysed. PDD, as observed at 6 weeks, was significantly greater than the preoperative values in both groups 1 and 2. It increased by a mean of 1±1.11 mm in group 1 and by 0.5±0.78 in group 2. This initial increase in PDD receded over time, but remained statistically significant in both groups, even at 6 months. The top 20% of patients with the largest PDD change comprised 13 out of 15 eyes from group 1, which was a statistically significant overrepresentation (p=0.0435).Moderate pupillotonia was induced post-ELR in vitrectomy and correlated to the extent of ELR.

We included 264 eyes of 139 patients treated for type 1 ROP or aggressive ROP (AROP) who were followed for at least 4 years. Laser treatment was initially performed in 187 eyes (the laser group), and anti-VEGF therapy was initially performed in 77 eyes (the anti-VEGF group). We collected data on sex, birth characteristics, zone, stage, and the presence of plus disease at the time of treatment and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), spherical equivalent (SE), and ocular complications (amblyopia and strabismus) in patients aged 4-6 years. We investigated the associations between treatment outcomes (BCVA, SE and the presence of amblyopia and strabismus) and influencing factors, including treatment procedure (anti-VEGF or laser therapy), sex, birth characteristics, zone, stage, and the presence of plus disease, using multivariable analysis and logistic regression analyses.The initial treatment procedure was not associated with any specific treatment outcome. Subgroup analysis of patients with zone I ROP revealed that the anti-VEGF-treated eyes had significantly better BCVA and higher SE than laser-treated eyes (p = 0.004, p = 0.009, respectively). Female patients presented significantly better BCVA, less amblyopia and less strabismus than male patients (p < 0.001, p = 0.029, p = 0.008, respectively).In zone I ROP, anti-VEGF therapy led to better visual acuity and less myopic refractive error than laser treatment.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,retinopathy,4

This study therefore aimed to investigate the extent to which regular intravitreal injections may be acceptable to GA patients.Thirty UK-based individuals with GA secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD), recruited from two London-based hospitals, were interviewed in April-October 2021 regarding acceptability of new GA treatments. Participants responded to a structured questionnaire, as well as open-ended questions in a semi-structured interview. The Theoretical Framework of Acceptability (TFA) informed framework analysis of the qualitative data.Twenty participants (67%) were female, and median (interquartile range (IQR)) age was 83 (78, 87) years. 37% of participants had foveal centre-involving GA, and better eye median (IQR) logMAR visual acuity was 0.30 (0.17, 0.58). Data suggested that 18 participants (60% (95% CI: 41-79%)) would accept the treatment, despite awareness of potential drawbacks. Eight participants (27% (95% CI: 10-43%) were ambivalent or undecided about treatment, and four (13%) (95% CI: 0-26%) would be unlikely to accept treatment. Reducing the frequency of injections from monthly to every other month increased the proportion of participants who considered the treatments acceptable. Conversely, factors limiting acceptability clustered around: the limited magnitude of treatment efficacy; concerns about side effects or the increased risk of neovascular AMD; and the logistical burden of regular clinic visits for intravitreal injections. Misunderstandings of potential benefits indicate the need for appropriately-designed patient education tools to support decision-making.Our study suggests a majority of participants would be positive about intravitreal treatment for GA, in spite of potential burdens.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,retinal disease,4

Screening results at baseline and over the next four years were analysed.1880 patients aged 80 and 1105 patients aged 85 were included. Patients referred to hospital eye service (HES) for DR ranged from 0.7% to 1.4% in the 80-year-old cohort over 5 years. In this cohort a total of 76 (4%) were referred to HES for DR, of which 11 (0.6%) received treatment. Over the course of the follow up (FU), 403 (21%) died. In the 85-year-old cohort, referral to HES for DR each year ranged from 0.1% to 1.3%. In this cohort a total of 27 (2.4%) were referred to HES for DR, of which 4 (0.4%) received treatment. Over the course of follow-up 541(49%) died. All treated cases were for maculopathy in both cohorts and there were no cases of proliferative diabetic retinopathy requiring treatment.This study showed that the risk of progression of retinopathy is quite low in this age group and only a small proportion of patients developed referable retinopathy requiring treatment. This suggests relooking at the need for screening and ideal screening intervals in patients aged 80 years and over with no referable DR as they can be potentially classed as a group with low risk of sight loss.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,effectiveness,,retinopathy,4

A quantitative analysis of the vascular network remodelling was performed using a computational software (Angiotool).A total of 53 eyes of 52 patients were included in the analysis. The total MNV area decreased significantly after three aflibercept injections (p = 0.003). Total vessel area and vessel density decreased respectively of 20% and 12% at V3 (p < 0.001 in both cases). Other parameters that reduced significantly were total vessel length, average vessel length and density of vascular junctions (p = 0.018, p = 0.002, and p = 0.044, respectively). The number of vascular endpoints (p = 0.001) and lacunarity (p = 0.011) increased significantly, whilst the number of vascular junctions did not vary significantly (p = 0.068). Changes in vascular metrics were predominantly driven by MNV type 1 and 2. No clear relationship was observed between any of the vascular metrics and the macular fluid status.Although objective quantification of vascular parameters showed a significant remodelling of the MNV post-loading phase of aflibercept in type 1 and 2 MNV subtypes, none of the quantified vascular metrics correlated to the macular fluid response. These findings highlight a dissociation of anti-angiogenic and anti-permeability properties of aflibercept therapy during the loading phase.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinal disease,4
2023-11-24,37291231,Impact of postnatal steroids on peripheral avascular retina and severity of retinopathy of prematurity.,"We investigated the role of postnatal steroids on the severity of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and its impact on peripheral avascular retina (PAR).A retrospective cohort study of infants born at ≤32 weeks gestation and/or birth weight ≤1500 g. Demographics, the dose and duration of steroid treatment, and age when full retinal vascularization occurred were collected. The primary outcomes were the severity of ROP and time to full vascularization of the retina.A total of 1695 patients were enrolled, 67% of whom received steroid therapy. Their birth weight was 1142 ± 396 g and gestational age was 28.6 ± 2.7 weeks. The total hydrocortisone-equivalent dose prescribed was 28.5 ± 74.3 mg/kg. The total days of steroid treatment were 8.9 ± 35.1 days. After correction for major demographic differences, infants who received a higher cumulative dose of steroids for a longer duration had a significantly increased incidence of severe ROP and PAR (P < 0.001). For each day of steroid treatment, there was a 3.2% increase in the hazard of the severe form of ROP (95% CI: 1.022-1.043) along with 5.7% delay in achieving full retinal vascularization (95% CI: 1.04-1.08) (P < 0.001).Cumulative dose and duration of postnatal steroid use were independently associated with the severity of ROP and PAR. Thus, postnatal steroids should be used very prudently.We report ROP outcomes in a large cohort of infants from two major healthcare systems where we have studied the impact of postnatal steroids on the severity of ROP, growth, and development of retinal vessels. After correcting our data for three major outcome measures, we show that high-dose postnatal steroids used for a prolonged duration of time are independently associated with severe ROP and delay in retinal vascularization. Postnatal steroids impact the visual outcomes of VLBW infants significantly, so their clinical use needs to be moderated.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,retinopathy,4
2023-11-24,37400566,Respiratory outcomes in preterm infants following intravitreal bevacizumab for retinopathy of prematurity-a 10-year matched case study.,"To evaluate respiratory outcomes in preterm infants with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) following intravitreal bevacizumab injection (IVB).This single-centre study enroled preterm infants with a gestational age (GA) < 34 weeks or a birth weight (BW) < 1500 g with bilateral type 1 ROP who received a single IVB, and a treatment-free control group matched by GA, postmenstrual age, and respiratory status at the time of the IVB. The primary outcome was serial respiratory changes in mean airway pressure (MAP), fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), and respiratory severity score (RSS, MAP x FiO2) during the 28-day post-IVB/matching period and overall respiratory improvement at day 28 and at discharge. The duration of supplemental oxygen therapy following IVB/matching was documented.A total of 5578 infants were included. Seventy-eight infants were enroled in the IVB group, and another 78 infants were matched as the control group. Both groups had downward trends in the MAP, FiO2, and RSS over the study period (all P < 0.001), but there were no between-group differences in these measures. The percentage of overall respiratory improvement was similar between the IVB and control groups, so was the duration of invasive and in-hospital oxygen ventilation. A lower percentage of oxygen dependence at discharge in the IVB group (P = 0.03) remained significant after adjusting for GA and BW.This is a matched case study to evaluate respiratory outcomes in preterm infants following IVB for ROP. We found that the IVBs did not compromise respiratory outcomes in preterm infants during the 28-day post-IVB period and at discharge.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,retinopathy,4

The patient was subsequently treated with three immunosuppressive drugs (tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and methylprednisolone) to prevent organ rejection, and no renal failure was noted. He visited our department with bloody stools and diarrhea, and a colonoscopy revealed mucosal edema and redness of the entire colon. After excluding infection and drug-induced enteritis based on the endoscopic and pathological findings, he was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis (UC). He was admitted and received a high dose of steroids, but did not demonstrate improvement. We initiated infliximab (IFX), and his symptoms improved within 3 days. After the second IFX treatment, the patient achieved clinical remission and was discharged. After the third IFX dose, the biomarker level became normal, and a colonoscopy after the fourth IFX dose revealed that all ulcers had become scarred and achieved endoscopic remission.

Eligible patients older than six months of age were enrolled. The feasibility of delivering three injections of melphalan into the ophthalmic artery every 28 days was assessed.Nine institutions participated in this trial. Fourteen patients were enrolled, two of whom were unevaluable for feasibility. Four patients experienced a feasibility failure. In two patients, the ophthalmic artery could not be accessed for the second IA injection, in one the artery could not be accessed for the first injection, and one patient experienced grade 4 hypotension during the procedure.Delivery of prescribed therapy within the context of this study did not meet the feasibility goals of the study with only a 67% feasibility success rate.

2023-11-24,37875374,Two-year recall for people with no diabetic retinopathy: a multi-ethnic population-based retrospective cohort study using real-world data to quantify the effect.,"The English Diabetic Eye Screening Programme (DESP) offers people living with diabetes (PLD) annual screening. Less frequent screening has been advocated among PLD without diabetic retinopathy (DR), but evidence for each ethnic group is limited. We examined the potential effect of biennial versus annual screening on the detection of sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy (STDR) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) among PLD without DR from a large urban multi-ethnic English DESP.PLD in North-East London DESP (January 2012 to December 2021) with no DR on two prior consecutive screening visits with up to 8 years of follow-up were examined. Annual STDR and PDR incidence rates, overall and by ethnicity, were quantified. Delays in identification of STDR and PDR events had 2-year screening intervals been used were determined.Among 82 782 PLD (37% white, 36% South Asian, and 16% black people), there were 1788 incident STDR cases over mean (SD) 4.3 (2.4) years (STDR rate 0.51, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.55 per 100-person-years). STDR incidence rates per 100-person-years by ethnicity were 0.55 (95% CI 0.48 to 0.62) for South Asian, 0.34 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.40) for white, and 0.77 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.90) for black people. Biennial screening would have delayed diagnosis by 1 year for 56.3% (1007/1788) with STDR and 43.6% (45/103) with PDR. Standardised cumulative rates of delayed STDR per 100 000 persons for each ethnic group were 1904 (95% CI 1683 to 2154) for black people, 1276 (95% CI 1153 to 1412) for South Asian people, and 844 (95% CI 745 to 955) for white people.Biennial screening would have delayed detection of some STDR and PDR by 1 year, especially among those of black ethnic origin, leading to healthcare inequalities.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,retinopathy,4
2023-11-24,37928879,Utilization of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors on dry eye disease severity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have protective effects against various systemic diseases and neoplasms. This retrospective cohort study evaluated the severity of dry eye disease (DED) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who were treated with SGLT2 inhibitors. Data were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. Patients with T2DM who were treated with SGLT2 inhibitors were assigned to the SGLT2 group. Each patient in the SGLT2 group was matched to two individuals with T2DM who had not used SGLT2 inhibitors, constituting the control group. The primary outcomes were the development of DED and severe DED. A diagnosis of severe DED was indicated by the usage of cyclosporine. Cox proportional hazard regression was applied to yield adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In the SGLT2 group, 1864 new DED events and 147 severe DED events were recorded. Conversely, 4367 new DED events and 392 severe DED events were recorded in the control group. The incidence (aHR: 0.858, 95% CI: 0.811-0.908, p = 0.0010) and severity (aHR: 0.652, 95% CI: 0.481-0.777, p = 0.0006) of DED were significantly lower in the SGLT2 group than the control group after adjusting for multiple covariates. In subgroup analyses, the incidence and severity of DED were significantly lower in patients younger than 60 years old who were treated with SGLT2 inhibitors than in their older counterparts (p = 0.0008 and 0.0011, respectively). In conclusion, utilization of SGLT2 inhibitors in the T2DM population could reduce both the incidence and severity of DED.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,dry eye,4
2023-11-24,37993533,Long-term outcomes of intravenous fibrinolysis in central retinal artery occlusion.,"Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is an ophthalmologic emergency that can lead to irreversible loss of vision. Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) has been used experimentally for its treatment. Our study aimed to evaluate the effect of emergency IVT on CRAO and its impact on visual acuity outcomes. We conducted a retrospective observational study of patients with CRAO. A total of 46 patients with CRAO were analysed; 16 patients received IVT treatment (IVT group) while 30 did not (no-IVT group). Seven patients from the IVT group received IVT early, within 4.5 hours (h) after the onset of symptoms (early-IVT), and 9 patients received it beyond this timeframe (late-IVT). The median time-to-hospital was 8.5 h: 3 h for the IVT group and 24 h for the no-IVT group. The median time-to-treatment was 5 h. The median outcome of visual acuity was 0.05 in the early-IVT, 0.025 in the late-IVT, and 0.01 in the no-IVT group. Among patients who received IVT early, 86% exhibited significant visual improvement. This improvement was four-fold greater compared to all other groups (p = 0.040), including the late-IVT (p = 0.011) and no-IVT groups (p = 0.023). No complications of the treatment were reported. Our study confirms that the administration of IVT treatment for CRAO within the 4.5-h time window is both safe and effective.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,retinal disease,4
2023-11-24,37993817,Prevalence and pattern of retinopathy of prematurity at two national referral hospitals in Uganda: a cross-sectional study.,"Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a leading cause of blindness in children and an ROP epidemic is predicted this decade in sub-Saharan Africa. With the increasing survival rate of preterm babies in Uganda, and no data on ROP prevalence, there is a need to assess the burden of ROP to inform preventive strategies and targeted screening.We conducted a two-center cross-sectional study of preterm (< 37 weeks gestational age) infants from the neonatal units of Kawempe National Referral Hospital (KNRH) and Mulago Specialised Women and Neonatal Hospital (MSWNH) from August 2022 to October 2022. An ophthalmologist examined all participants using an indirect ophthalmoscope with a + 20D convex lens and captured digital images using a Volk iNview™ Fundus Camera. The collected data were entered into Epidata 4.2 and exported to Stata 14.0 for analysis.331 preterm infants enrolled in this study. The oxygen received was unblended. The mean gestational age was 30.4 ± 2.7 weeks, and the mean birth weight was 1597 ± 509 g. 18/101 (17.8%) were found to have any ROP amongst the preterm infants recruited from MSWNH, 1/230 (0.4%) from KNRH [95% CI] had any stage of ROP (i.e. stage 5). Of these, 8 (42.1%) had stage 2 ROP. Infants with a birth weight below 1500 g were 10 times more likely to have ROP than those among infants with a birth weight more than 1500 g [AOR: 10.07 (2.71-37.44)]. Infants who were not fed exclusively on breast milk had higher odds of having ROP than those exclusively fed on breast milk [AOR: 7.82(1.92-31.82)].6% of preterm infants born in two tertiary hospitals in Uganda were found to have ROP. Lack of exclusive feeding on breast milk and birth weight of less than 1500 g were strong predictors of ROP. The higher prevalence of ROP in MSWNH calls for cautious use of oxygen among preterms.

Visual acuity, fundus photographs, and optical coherence tomography measurements were obtained and analyzed. Data are presented as medians (ranges).A total of seven eyes underwent PAIR and were followed up for 339 days (188-436 days). No intraoperative complications were noted. One eye exhibited postoperative macular hole formation, but the hole was healed through fluid-gas exchange. At the last follow-up, the visual acuity had improved from 20/66 (20/332-20/40) to 20/40 (20/100-20/25), and the central foveal thickness had decreased from 576 µ m to 269 µ m. A repositioned internal limiting membrane (ILM) was observed in six of the eyes, and inner retinal dimples were noted in only two eyes. However, retinal wrinkles under the repositioned or perifoveal ILM were noted in five eyes.The PAIR technique relieved traction, restored the ILM, and achieved functional and morphological improvement in eyes with myopic foveoschisis. Limited occurrence of inner retinal dimples and retinal thinning was noted, but retinal wrinkles occurred, likely due to ILM contracture.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,retinal disease,4

The ultrasound probe was placed over the eye to use the images to witness the vitreous movement around the cutter and to establish its position in relation to the retinal wall. The procedure was performed in at least four ultrasound projections (longitudinal-9,6, 3, and 12). All patients were followed for three months, and in each visit, the visual acuity and the presence of adverse effects were assessed.Overall, 12 patients (mean age: 56.2 ± 18.4 years) were enrolled. Visual acuity at baseline was 2.3 ± 0.25 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution. Sixty-six percent achieved inactivation of endophthalmitis. Two patients had evisceration caused by uncontrolled infection, and two more had retinal detachment during follow-up. Visual acuity at the end of follow-up was 2.1 ± 0.3 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution ( P = 0.5).Ultrasound-guided vitrectomy is a feasible surgical technique.

2023-11-27,36731588,Adalimumab in Biologic-naïve Patients With Crohn's Disease After Resolution of an Intra-abdominal Abscess: A Prospective Study From the GETAID.,"The management of intra-abdominal abscesses complicating Crohn's disease (CD) is challenging, and surgery with delayed intestinal resection is often recommended. The aims of this study were to estimate the success rate of adalimumab (ADA) in patients with CD with an intra-abdominal abscess resolved without surgery, and to identify predictive factors for success.A multicenter, prospective study was conducted in biologic-naïve patients with CD with resolved intra-abdominal abscess treated with ADA with a 2-year follow-up. The primary endpoint was ADA failure at week (W) 24 defined as a need for steroids after W12, intestinal resection, abscess recurrence, and clinical relapse. Secondary post-hoc endpoint was the long-term success defined as the survival without abscess relapse or intestinal resection at W104. The factors associated with ADA failure at W24 and W104 were identified using a logistic and a Cox regression, respectively.From April 2013 to December 2017, 190 patients from 27 GETAID centers were screened, and 117 were included in the analysis. Fifty-eight patients (50%) were male, and the median age at baseline was 28 years. At W24, 87 patients (74%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 65.5%-82.0%; n = 117) achieved ADA success. Among the 30 patients with ADA failure, 15 underwent surgery. At W104, the survival rate without abscess recurrence or surgery was 72.9% (95% CI, 62.1%-79.8%; n = 109). Abscess drainage was significantly associated with ADA failure at W24 (odds ratio, 4.18; 95% CI, 1.06-16.5; P =0 .043).

From September 2019 to June 2022, 54 patients with complete or partial posterior vitreous detachment who underwent vitrectomy for primary RRD by a single surgeon were enrolled.After staining the vitreous with triamcinolone acetonide, the presence of VCR was assessed in detail. If VCR were present, the macular VCR were removed using surgical forceps, and then, a free flap of peripheral VCR was used as a handle for removing peripheral VCR using the beveled vitrectomy probe. Of the total patients, the presence of VCR was confirmed in 16 patients (29.6%). There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications, except for retinal redetachment caused by proliferative vitreoretinopathy, that occurred in only one eye (1.9%).Using a beveled vitrectomy probe was a practical solution for removing VCR during RRD vitrectomy because additional instruments were not needed and risk of iatrogenic retinal damage was low.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"safety, effectiveness",,retinal disease,4

In part 1, 77 participants were randomized 1:1:1 to receive monthly intravitreal injections of ACP 1 mg, ACP 2 mg, or sham. In part 2, 209 participants were randomized 1:2:2 to receive monthly ACP 2 mg, ACP 4 mg, or sham. The mean rate of change of GA over 18 months was measured by fundus autofluorescence.Compared with their respective sham cohorts, monthly ACP treatment reduced the mean GA growth (square root transformation) over 18 months by 28.1% (0.168 mm, 95% CI [0.066, 0.271]) for the 2 mg cohort and 30.0% (0.167 mm, 95% CI [0.062, 0.273]) for the 4 mg cohort. ACP treatment was generally well tolerated over 18 months, with most ocular adverse events (AEs) related to the injection procedure. Macular neovascularization (MNV) was more frequent in both 2 mg (11.9%) and 4 mg (15.7%) cohorts than their respective sham control groups (2.7% and 2.4%).Over this 18-month study, ACP 2 mg and 4 mg showed continued reductions in the progression of GA growth compared to sham and continued to be generally well tolerated.

Secondary outcomes included clinical, laboratory, endoscopic, and transmural remission.We included 141 patients where 54%, 26%, 11%, and 9% started biologic therapy at ≤6, 7-12, 13-18, and 19-24 months after diagnosis, respectively. A total of 34 patients [24%] reached the primary outcome: 8% had progression of disease behaviour, 15% were hospitalised, and 9% required surgery. There was no difference in the time to a CD-related complication according to the time of initiation of biologic therapy within the first 24 months. Clinical, endoscopic, and transmural remission was achieved in 85%, 50%, and 29%, respectively, but no differences were found according to the time of initiation of biologic therapy.Starting anti-TNF therapy within the first 24 months after diagnosis was associated with a low rate of CD-related complications and high rates of clinical and endoscopic remission, although we found no differences with earlier initiation within this window of opportunity.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,crohn's disease,4
2023-11-27,37221361,Alterations in retrobulbar haemodynamics in thyroid eye disease.,"To study the orbital perfusion parameters of ophthalmic artery (OA) and central retinal artery (CRA) in inactive TED and the changes following surgical decompression.Non-randomised clinical trial. 24 inactive moderate-to-severe TED orbits of 24 euthyroid cases underwent surgical decompression and examined again at 3 months. The peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-diastolic velocity (EDV), and resistivity index (RI) of OA and CRA were evaluated using colour doppler imaging and normative database was established using 18 healthy controls.The mean age was 39.38 ± 12.56 years and male: female ratio was 1: 1.18. Intraocular pressure was higher, and CRA-PSV, CRA-RI, OA-PSV, and OA-EDV were lower in TED in comparison to heathy orbits. The CRA-PSV, CRA-EDV, OA-PSV, and OA-EDV negatively correlated with proptosis and duration of thyroid disease. The area under curve of OA-PSV (95% CI:0.964-1.000, p < 0.001) and OA-EDV (95% CI:0.699-0.905, p < 0.001) helped in differentiating TED orbits from HC, and in predicting the severity of disease. Post decompression, CRA-PSV, CRA-EDV, OA-PSV, and OA-EDV improved, with decrease in CRA-RI and OA-RI in both lipogenic and MO.The orbital perfusion is reduced in inactive TED. The changes in OA flow velocities can help in differentiating inactive TED from healthy orbits and progression of TED. Sequential orbital CDI of OA and CRA can serve as an objective tool for case selection and monitoring response to surgical decompression.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, diagnostic",,retinopathy,4

Specifically, internal consistency and inter-rater reliability, convergent, discriminant and known-group validity, and sensitivity to change were assessed at Baseline, and at Weeks 8 and 52.Internal consistency for the RHI showed lower alpha [α] values at Baseline [α = 0.62] relative to Weeks 8 [α = 0.82] and 52 [α = 0.81]. The inter-rater reliability values of RHI [0.91], NI [0.64] and GS [0.53] were excellent, good and fair, respectively. Regarding validity, Week 52 correlations were moderate to strong between full and partial Mayo scores and Mayo subscale scores and the RHI and GS, and were weak to moderate for the NI. Significant differences between mean scores of all three histological indices were observed across known-groups based on Mayo endoscopy subscores and full Mayo scores at Weeks 8 and 52 [p < 0.001].The GS, RHI and NI are each capable of producing reliable and valid scores that are sensitive to changes in disease activity over time, in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. While all three indices demonstrated relatively acceptable measurement properties, the GS and RHI performed better than the NI.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,4
2023-11-27,37306285,Development of the Escalation of Therapy or Intervention (ETI) Calculator for Patients with Ulcerative Colitis Using ePROMs.,"Digital collection of patient-reported outcome measures [PROMs] is largely unexplored as a basis for follow-up for patients with ulcerative colitis [UC]. Our aim was to develop a model to predict the likelihood of escalation of therapy or intervention at an outpatient appointment that may be used to rationalize follow-up.TrueColours-IBD is a web-based, real-time, remote monitoring software that allows longitudinal collection of ePROMs. Data for prediction modelling were derived from a Development Cohort, guided by the TRIPOD statement. Logistic regression modelling used ten candidate items to predict escalation of therapy or intervention. An Escalation of Therapy or Intervention [ETI] calculator was developed, and applied in a Validation Cohort at the same centre.The Development Cohort [n = 66] was recruited in 2016 and followed for 6 months [208 appointments]. From ten items, four significant predictors of ETI were identified: SCCAI, IBD Control-8, faecal calprotectin, and platelets. For practicality, a model with only SCCAI and IBD Control-8, both entered remotely by the patient, without the need for faecal calprotectin or blood tests was selected. Between 2018 and 2020, a Validation Cohort of 538 patients [1188 appointments] was examined. A 5% threshold on the ETI calculator correctly identified 343/388 [88%] escalations and 274/484 [57%] non-escalations.A calculator based on digital, patient-entered data on symptoms and quality of life can predict whether a patient with UC requires escalation of therapy or intervention at an outpatient appointment.

2023-11-27,37310877,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Increased Adalimumab Dose Intervals in Crohn's Disease Patients in Stable Remission: The Randomized Controlled LADI Trial.,"We aimed to assess cost-effectiveness of increasing adalimumab dose intervals compared to the conventional dosing interval in patients with Crohn's disease [CD] in stable clinical and biochemical remission.We conducted a pragmatic, open-label, randomized controlled non-inferiority trial, comparing increased adalimumab intervals with the 2-weekly interval in adult CD patients in clinical remission. Quality of life was measured with the EQ-5D-5L. Costs were measured from a societal perspective. Results are shown as differences and incremental net monetary benefit [iNMB] at relevant willingness to accept [WTA] levels.We randomized 174 patients to the intervention [n = 113] and control [n = 61] groups. No difference was found in utility (difference: -0.017, 95% confidence interval [-0.044; 0.004]) and total costs (-€943, [-€2226; €1367]) over the 48-week study period between the two groups. Medication costs per patient were lower (-€2545, [-€2780; -€2192]) in the intervention group, but non-medication healthcare (+€474, [+€149; +€952]) and patient costs (+€365 [+€92; €1058]) were higher. Cost-utility analysis showed that the iNMB was €594 [-€2099; €2050], €69 [-€2908; €1965] and -€455 [-€4,096; €1984] at WTA levels of €20 000, €50 000 and €80 000, respectively. Increasing adalimumab dose intervals was more likely to be cost-effective at WTA levels below €53 960 per quality-adjusted life year. Above €53 960 continuing the conventional dose interval was more likely to be cost-effective.When the loss of a quality-adjusted life year is valued at less than €53 960, increasing the adalimumab dose interval is a cost-effective strategy in CD patients in stable clinical and biochemical remission.ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03172377.",no,yes,no,human RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,crohn's disease,4

Recalcitrance was defined as persistent fluid after ≥6 monthly ranibizumab injections. Serum and aqueous humor ADAs were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoprecipitation, respectively.Two of 156 ranibizumab-treated patients were ADA-positive. The patients received six and 14 ranibizumab injections, respectively, up to 4 weeks prior to blood collection. The serum ADA concentration was estimated to be approximately 50,000 ng/mL. Neutralizing ADAs were confirmed in both samples. A specific band was detected by immunoprecipitation only in ADA-positive samples, consistent with the results of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Based on an assessment of the degree of sensitivity of commercially available anti-ranibizumab antibodies, it was estimated that the immunoprecipitation method could detect ADA levels >30 ng. Nevertheless, ADAs were not detected in the aqueous humor of either the experimental or control group.In the aqueous humor, ADAs are either not present or are present at a lower concentration than that which can be detected by immunoprecipitation. This presumably reflects the fact that blood ADA is the product of systemic circulation clearance through anterior elimination of intravitreal ranibizumab. Based on our results, ADAs do not return to the eye in sufficient quantities to interfere with the action of ranibizumab in the vitreous cavity.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"safety, biomarker",,retinal disease,4

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of fidaxomicin for the treatment of C. difficile infection in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.This was a multicenter retrospective study of adults with inflammatory bowel disease and C. difficile infection treated with fidaxomicin with at least 3 months of follow up. The primary outcomes were treatment response, defined as resolution of C. difficile infection-attributed diarrhea and/or negative C. difficile infection stool test, and time to C. difficile infection recurrence after fidaxomicin.Thirty-three patients (median age 42 years; 60.6% female) were included.

Fidaxomicin led to resolution of C. difficile infection in 20 (60.6%) patients, with 6/20 (30.0%) developing a recurrence at a median of 55 days. Most patients who failed to respond to fidaxomicin underwent fecal microbiota transplantation (10/13, 76.9%) with resolution.In this cohort of patients with inflammatory bowel disease and C. difficile infection, 60.6% responded to treatment with fidaxomicin.

Among them, 28 patients underwent botulinum neurotoxin therapy and attended another two postoperative visits at 1 month and 3 months. Motor severity was measured with Jankovic Rating Scale (JRS) and Blepharospasm Disability Index (BSDI). We assessed dry eye using OSDI questionnaire, Schirmer test, tear break-up time (TBUT), tear meniscus height, lipid layer thickness (LLT) and corneal fluorescence staining. Zung's Self-rating Anxiety and Depression Scale (SAS, SDS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were for mood status and sleep quality evaluations.Patients with dry eye or mood disorders had higher JRS scores (5.78 ± 1.13, 5.97 ± 1.30) than those without (5.12 ± 1.40, 5.50 ± 1.16; P = 0.039, 0.019, respectively). BSDI values of patients with sleep disturbance (14.61 ± 4.71) was higher than those without (11.89 ± 5.44, P = 0.006). Correlations were found between JRS, BSDI and SAS, SDS, PSQI, OSDI, TBUT. Botulinum neurotoxin effectively relieved JRS, BSDI and improved PSQI, OSDI, TBUT, LLT (8.11 ± 5.81, 21.77 ± 15.76, 5.04 ± 2.15 s, 79.61 ± 24.11 nm) at the 1-month visit compared to baseline (9.75 ± 5.60, 33.58 ± 13.27, 4.14 ± 2.21 s, 62.33 ± 22.01 nm; P = 0.006, < 0.001, = 0.027, < 0.001, respectively).The BEB patients with dry eye, mood disorders, or sleep disturbance had more severe motor disorders.

2023-11-27,37347245,Impact of axial length on visual outcomes and complications in phacoemulsification surgery: a multicenter database study.,"To analyze the impact of axial length (AL) on the visual outcome and rate of perioperative complications in phacoemulsification surgery.Retrospective clinical database study.Cataract surgery data of 217,556 eyes was extracted from the electronic medical records of 8 ophthalmic centers in the United Kingdom from July 2003 to March 2015. A total of 88,774 eyes without ocular co-pathologies were grouped eyes according to AL (mm): short AL (< 22), average AL (22-26; reference group), and long AL (> 26).We analyzed visual acuity (VA) outcomes at 4 weeks, 4-12 weeks, and 12-24 weeks postoperatively, as well as the incidence of posterior capsular rupture (PCR), torn iris (TI), cystoid macular edema (CME), and retinal detachment (RD).Mean pre-operative VA (logMAR) was the worst in eyes with long AL compared to average and short AL eyes (VA 0.59 vs. 0.58 and 0.56; p < 0.001). However, post-operative VA at 4-12 weeks was slightly better in the long AL group (0.14 in short and average AL; 0.12 in long AL, p < 0.001). We observed an increased odds of TI in the short AL group (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.60-2.75). There was increased risk of RD in long AL eyes (p < 0.001). However, PCR and CME rates were not different.In the absence of any coexisting ocular pathology, AL alone did not have an impact on VA improvement or the risk of encountering PCR or CME.

2023-11-27,37348779,Fetal growth restriction and small for gestational age as predictors of neonatal morbidity: which growth nomogram to use?,"Fetal growth nomograms were developed to screen for fetal growth restriction and guide clinical care to improve perinatal outcomes; however, existing literature remains inconclusive regarding which nomogram is the gold standard.This study aimed to compare the ability of 4 commonly used nomograms (Hadlock, International Fetal and Newborn Growth Consortium for the 21st Century, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development-unified standard, and World Health Organization fetal growth charts) and 1 institution-specific reference to predict small for gestational age and poor neonatal outcomes.This was a retrospective cohort study of all nonanomalous singleton pregnancies undergoing ultrasound at ≥20 weeks of gestation between 2013 and 2020 and delivering at a single academic center. Using random selection methods, the study sample was restricted to 1 pregnancy per patient and 1 ultrasound per pregnancy completed at ≥22 weeks of gestation. Fetal biometry data were used to calculate estimated fetal weight and percentiles according to the aforementioned 5 nomograms. Maternal and neonatal data were extracted from electronic medical records. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between estimated fetal weight of <10th and <3rd percentiles compared with estimated fetal weight of 10th to 90th percentile as the reference group for small for gestational age and the neonatal composite outcomes (perinatal mortality, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy or seizures, respiratory morbidity, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, hyperbilirubinemia or hypoglycemia requiring neonatal intensive care unit admission, and retinopathy of prematurity). Receiver operating characteristic curve contrast estimation (primary analysis) and test characteristics were calculated for all nomograms and the prediction of small for gestational age and the neonatal composite outcomes. We restricted the sample to ultrasounds performed within 28 days of delivery; moreover, similar analyses were completed to assess the prediction of small for gestational age and neonatal composite outcomes.Among 10,045 participants, the proportion of fetuses classified as <10th percentile varied across nomograms from 4.9% to 9.7%. Fetuses with an estimated fetal weight of <10th percentile had an increased risk of small for gestational age (odds ratio, 9.9 [95% confidence interval, 8.5-11.5] to 12.8 [95% confidence interval, 10.9-15.0]). In addition, the estimated fetal weight of <10th and <3rd percentile was associated with increased risk of the neonatal composite outcome (odds ratio, 2.4 [95% confidence interval, 2.0-2.8] to 3.5 [95% confidence interval, 2.9-4.3] and 5.7 [95% confidence interval, 4.5-7.2] to 8.8 [95% confidence interval, 6.6-11.8], respectively). The prediction of small for gestational age with an estimated fetal weight of <10th percentile had a positive likelihood ratio of 6.3 to 8.5 and an area under the curve of 0.62 to 0.67. Similarly, the prediction of the neonatal composite outcome with an estimated fetal weight of <10th percentile had a positive likelihood ratio of 2.1 to 3.1 and an area under the curve of 0.55 to 0.57. When analyses were restricted to ultrasound within 4 weeks of delivery, among fetuses with an estimated fetal weight of <10th percentile, the risk of small for gestational age increased across all nomograms (odds ratio, 16.7 [95% confidence interval, 12.6-22.3] to 25.1 [95% confidence interval, 17.0-37.0]), and prediction improved (positive likelihood ratio, 8.3-15.0; area under the curve, 0.69-0.75). Similarly, the risk of neonatal composite outcome increased (odds ratio, 3.2 [95% confidence interval, 2.4-4.2] to 5.2 [95% confidence interval, 3.8-7.2]), and prediction marginally improved (positive likelihood ratio, 2.4-4.1; area under the curve, 0.60-0.62). Importantly, the risk of both being small for gestational age and having the neonatal composite outcome further increased (odds ratio, 21.4 [95% confidence interval, 13.6-33.6] to 28.7 (95% confidence interval, 18.6-44.3]), and the prediction of concurrent small for gestational age and neonatal composite outcome greatly improved (positive likelihood ratio, 6.0-10.0; area under the curve, 0.80-0.83).In this large cohort, Hadlock, recent fetal growth nomograms, and a local population-derived fetal growth reference performed comparably in the prediction of small for gestational age and neonatal composite outcomes.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,retinopathy,4

Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography features were documented. The eyes with iERMs involving the fovea were assigned to the localized and diffused groups depending on the morphological description of the membrane. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to explore the factors associated with the final VA.The mean age was 9.2 ± 3.8 years. The mean follow-up period was 38.9 ± 45.4 months. After surgery, the central foveal thickness and the best-corrected VA (BCVA) improved significantly (all, P < 0.05). Fourteen eyes with iERMs showed involvement of the foveal area (localized group, six eyes; diffused group, eight eyes). There were no significant differences in the preoperative BCVA between the two groups (P = 0.064). However, the final BCVA was better in the diffused group than in the localized group (P = 0.043). Multiple regression analysis indicated that the localized membrane (P = 0.042) and lower preoperative BCVA (P = 0.043) were factors associated with a worse final VA in pediatric iERMs.Surgical removal of ERM showed a high anatomical and functional success rate in children. In pediatric patients with iERMs involving the fovea, a good VA was more common when the membrane was diffused than when it was localized.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,effectiveness,,retinal disease,4
2023-11-27,37369498,Effect of the Mediterranean Diet on Progression of Dry Form of Age-related Macular Degeneration.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the possible effect of the Mediterranean diet (Med Diet) on the progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in patients with early or intermediate stages of dry AMD.The present study included 164 patients with early or intermediate dry AMD. Data collected included demographics, anthropometric data, ophthalmic and medical history. AMD progression was evaluated using patients' optical coherence tomography (OCT) and visual acuity. Using the MedDietScore, sample's attachment to Med Diet was evaluated, and distinguished into high and low. The association of supplement intake and adherence to Med Diet with AMD progression was investigated using logistic regression.Sample's mean age was 73±7.4 years. A positive correlation was found between dietary supplementation and slowing of AMD progression, as well as between high adherence to Med Diet and slowing of AMD progression. In contrast, smokers had 51.4% higher risk of AMD progression (p=0.043). The rate of slowing AMD progression was higher in patients who followed Med Diet and received a dietary supplement, compared to patients who followed one or none of the aforementioned recommendations (p<0.001).Adherence to the Med Diet could have a positive effect on delaying AMD progression in advanced stages, both in patients receiving or not antioxidants.

However, it is unclear whether similar differences exist with ustekinumab, and what factors differentiate delayed responders from nonresponders.This study was a post hoc analysis of patient-level data from the UNIFI clinical trial. Ustekinumab-treated patients with clinical response, defined as a reduction in total Mayo score of 30% or more and 3 or more points from baseline with a reduction in their rectal bleeding subscore of 1 or more or a rectal bleeding subscore of 1 or less, at week 8 were deemed early responders and their outcomes were compared with delayed responders (week 8 nonresponders who subsequently responded at week 16). The primary outcome assessed was 1-year clinical remission, defined as a total Mayo score of 2 or less and no subscore greater than 1.We included 642 ustekinumab-treated patients, including 321 (50%) early responders, 115 (17.9%) delayed responders, and 205 (32.1%) nonresponders. No differences were observed for 1-year clinical remission among early vs delayed responders (132 of 321 [41.1%] vs 40 of 115 [34.8%]; P = .233), or for other outcomes assessed regardless of induction dose. Compared with early responders, delayed responders had more severe baseline Mayo endoscopic disease (88 of 115 [76.5%] vs 206 of 321 [64.2%]; P = .015) and abnormal baseline C-reactive protein level greater than 3 mg/L (83 of 115 [72.2%] vs 183 of 321 [57%]; P = .004). Compared with nonresponders, delayed responders had a significant decrease in C-reactive protein level (F-value [degrees of freedom, mean squares] [4, 844]; P < .0001) and fecal calprotectin level (F[4, 818]; P < .0001) through week 16.Compared with early ustekinumab responders, delayed responders had a greater inflammatory burden at baseline.

2023-11-27,37402275,Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events by Baseline Cardiovascular Risk in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis Treated with Tofacitinib: Data from the OCTAVE Clinical Programme.,"Patients with inflammatory bowel disease have increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular [CV] disease [ASCVD]. Tofacitinib is an oral ﻿Janus kinase inhibitor for the treatment of ulcerative colitis [UC]. We report major adverse CV events [MACE] in the UC OCTAVE programme, stratified by baseline CV risk.Rates of MACE were analysed by baseline [first tofacitinib exposure] CV risk profile: prior ASCVD, or 10-year ASCVD risk categories [low, borderline, intermediate, high].Of 1157 patients [2814.4 patient-years of exposure; ≤7.8 years' tofacitinib treatment], 4% had prior ASCVD and 83% had no prior ASCVD and low-borderline baseline 10-year ASCVD risk. Eight [0.7%] patients developed MACE; one had prior ASCVD. Incidence rates [unique patients with events/100 patient-years of exposure; 95% confidence intervals] for MACE were: 0.95 [0.02-5.27] in patients with prior ASCVD; and 1.81 [0.05-10.07], 1.54 [0.42-3.95], 0.00 [0.00-2.85], and 0.09 [0.01-0.32] in patients without prior ASCVD and with high, intermediate, -borderline, and low baseline 10-year ASCVD risk, respectively. For the 5/7 patients with MACE and without prior ASCVD, 10-year ASCVD risk scores were numerically higher [>1%] prior to MACE versus at baseline, primarily due to increasing age.Most patients receiving tofacitinib in the UC OCTAVE programme had low baseline 10-year ASCVD risk. MACE were more frequent in patients with prior ASCVD and higher baseline CV risk. This analysis demonstrates potential associations between baseline CV risk and MACE in patients with UC, suggesting CV risk should be assessed individually in clinical practice.NCT00787202; NCT01465763; NCT01458951; NCT01458574; NCT01470612.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,safety,,ulcerative colitis,4

We used total colectomy (TC) for ulcerative colitis (UC) as a model for a significant disruption in gut microbiome to explore an association with subsequent risk of IAD.We identified all patients with UC and no diagnosis of IAD prior to their UC diagnosis in Denmark from 1988 to 2015. Patients were followed from the date of UC to a diagnosis of IAD, death or end of follow-up, whichever occurred first. We used Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of IAD associated with TC, adjusting for age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and calendar year of UC diagnosis.30,507 patients with UC (3,155 with TC and 27,352 without) were identified from the Danish National Patient Registry. During 43,266 person-years of follow-up, 2733 patients were diagnosed with an IAD. The risk of any IAD was higher for patients with TC compared to patients without (adjusted HR [aHR] 1.39 (95% CI: 1.24-1.57)). When the analyses were adjusted for exposure to antibiotics, immunomodulatory medicine and biologics (covering 2005-2018), the risk of IAD was still higher for patients with total colectomy (aHR = 1.41 (95% CI: 1.09;1.83)). Disease-specific analyses were weakened by a low number of outcomes.The risk of IAD was higher for patients who underwent TC for UC compared to patients who did not.KEY MESSAGESWhat is already known?o The gut microbiome plays an important role in host immune homeostasis, and changes in gut bacterial diversity and composition may change the individual's risk of inflammatory and autoimmune disease (IAD).What is new here?o Patients with ulcerative colitis who undergo total colectomy have a higher risk of being diagnosed with IAD, compared to patients with ulcerative colitis who do not undergo total colectomy.How can this study help patient care?o Future research can help uncover the mechanisms responsible for the higher risk of certain IADs after total colectomy. If the microbiome plays a role, modifying the gut microbiome could prove a viable therapeutic strategy to reduce the risk of developing IADs.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"safety, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,4
2023-11-27,37421135,Safety and effectiveness of IV Thrombolysis in retinal artery occlusion: A multicenter retrospective cohort study.,"Retinal artery occlusion (RAO) may lead to irreversible blindness. For acute RAO, intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) can be considered as treatment. However, due to the rarity of RAO, data about IVT safety and effectiveness is limited.From the multicenter database ThRombolysis for Ischemic Stroke Patients (TRISP), we retrospectively analyzed visual acuity (VA) at baseline and within 3 months in IVT and non-IVT treated RAO patients. Primary outcome was difference of VA between baseline and follow up (∆VA). Secondary outcomes were rates of visual recovery (defined as improvement of VA ⩾ 0.3 logMAR), and safety (symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) according to ECASS II criteria, asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and major extracranial bleeding). Statistical analysis was performed using parametric tests and a linear regression model adjusted for age, sex and baseline VA.We screened 200 patients with acute RAO and included 47 IVT and 34 non-IVT patients with complete information about recovery of vision. Visual Acuity at follow up significantly improved compared to baseline in IVT patients (∆VA 0.5 ± 0.8, p < 0.001) and non-IVT patients (∆VA 0.40 ± 1.1, p < 0.05). No significant differences in ∆VA and visual recovery rate were found between groups at follow up. Two asymptomatic ICH (4%) and one (2%) major extracranial bleeding (intraocular bleeding) occurred in the IVT group, while no bleeding events were reported in the non-IVT group.Our study provides real-life data from the largest cohort of IVT treated RAO patients published so far. While there is no evidence for superiority of IVT compared to conservative treatment, bleeding rates were low. A randomized controlled trial and standardized outcome assessments in RAO patients are justified to assess the net benefit of IVT in RAO.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,retinal disease,4
2023-11-27,37422204,"Detailed Clinical, Ophthalmic, and Genetic Characterization of ADGRV1-Associated Usher Syndrome.","To present the clinical characteristics, retinal features, natural history, and genetics of ADGRV1-Usher syndrome (USH).Multicenter international retrospective cohort study.Clinical notes, hearing loss history, multimodal retinal imaging, and molecular diagnosis were reviewed. Thirty patients (28 families) with USH type 2 and disease-causing variants in ADGRV1 were identified. Visual function, retinal imaging, and genetics were evaluated and correlated, with retinal features also compared with those of the commonest cause of USH type 2, USH2A-USH.The mean age at the first visit was 38.6 ± 12.0 years (range: 19-74 years), and the mean follow-up time was 9.0 ± 7.7 years. Hearing loss was reported in the first decade of life by all patients, 3 (10%) described progressive loss, and 93% had moderate-severe impairment. Visual symptom onset was at 17.0 ± 7.7 years of age (range: 6-32 years), with 13 patients noticing problems before the age of 16. At baseline, 90% of patients had no or mild visual impairment. The most frequent retinal features were a hyperautofluorescent ring at the posterior pole (70%), perimacular patches of decreased autofluorescence (59%), and mild-moderate peripheral bone-spicule-like deposits (63%). Twenty-six (53%) variants were previously unreported, 19 families (68%) had double-null genotypes, and 9 were not-double-null. Longitudinal analysis showed significant differences between baseline and follow-up central macular thickness (-1.25 µm/y), outer nuclear layer thickness (-1.19 µm/y), and ellipsoid zone width (-40.9 µm/y). The rate of visual acuity decline was 0.02 LogMAR (1 letter)/y, and the rate of constriction of the hyperautofluorescent ring was 0.23 mm2/y.ADGRV1-USH is characterized by early-onset, usually non-progressive, mild-to-severe hearing loss and generally good central vision until late adulthood. Perimacular atrophic patches and relatively retained ellipsoid zone and central macular thickness in later adulthood are more often seen in ADGRV1-USH than in USH2A-USH.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, biomarker",,"retinopathy, retinal disease",4
2023-11-27,37432451,Incidence and treatment approach of intraocular pressure elevation after various types of local steroids for retinal diseases.,"For the treatment of macular edema, in addition to the use of antivascular endothelial growth factors, steroids are also used intravitreally and sub-Tenon. Side effects include among others cataract formation and elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP). The aim of this retrospective study was to elicit the IOP elevation after administration of various steroidal medication, the time of onset, and the efficacy of the administered IOP-lowering therapies.We included 428 eyes with a postoperative (n = 136), diabetic (n = 148), uveitic macular edema (n = 61), and macular edema after retinal vein occlusion (n = 83). These patients were treated with one or more diverse steroidal agents once or multiple times. These drugs included: triamcinolone acetonide (TMC) as intravitreal injection (TMC IVI) or sub-Tenon (TMC ST), as well as dexamethasone (DXM) and fluocinolone acetonide (FA) intravitreally. An increase of IOP of ≥ 25 mmHg was designated as pathological. A steroid response in anamnesis, the time of onset of IOP rise from the first administration, and the therapy administered were documented.Of 428 eyes, 168 eyes (39.3%) had IOP elevation up to a mean of 29.7 (SD ± 5.6) mmHg, which occurred at a median of 5.5 months. Steroids most frequently leading to rise of IOP included DXM (39.1% of all eyes receiving that drug), TMC IVI (47.6%), TMC ST combined with DXM (51.5%), DXM with FA (56.8%), and TMC IVI with DXM (57.4%). A Kaplan-Meier analysis and the Log Rank test showed a significant difference (p < 0.001). IOP rise was treated as follows: 119 conservatively (70.8%), and 21 surgically (12.5%, cyclophotocoagulation 8.3%, filtering surgery 1.8%, in 4 the steroidal drug implant was removed 2.4%), and 28 eyes received no therapy (16.7%). Sufficient IOP regulation was achieved in 82 eyes (68.9%) with topical therapy. In 37 eyes (31.1%) with persistently elevated intraocular pressure, topical therapy had to be continued over the follow-up of 20 ± 7 months.IOP increases after any type of steroid application are not rare. Results of our study let us suspect that especially therapy with intravitreal dexamethasone, either as a monotherapy or in combination with another steroid, tends to increase IOP more than other steroids. Regular IOP checks are necessary after each steroid administration, with possible initiation of long-term conservative and/or surgical therapy if necessary.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"safety, effectiveness",,retinal disease,4

All patients underwent 25-gauge pars plana vitrectomy, posterior vitreous detachment, injection of subretinal balanced salt solution and filtered air followed by partial fluid air exchange, 20% sulfur hexafluoride tamponade, and heads-up positioning postoperatively. Degree of displacement of SMH was assessed at 1 month and change in best-corrected visual acuity was assessed at 3 months.Ten patients with massive SMH who underwent the aforementioned procedure were included. Complete displacement of bleed from the macula was achieved in nine (90%) of 10 eyes at 1 month. There was significant improvement in best-corrected visual acuity from baseline at 1 month ( P = 0.015) and 3 months ( P = 0.043).Pars plana vitrectomy with injection of subretinal balanced salt solution and filtered air was well-tolerated and efficacious in displacing large and thick SMH in patients operated within 2 weeks of onset of symptoms.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,retinal disease,4

VA and optical coherence tomography (OCT) characteristics were evaluated to determine visual and anatomical outcomes up to 24 months after treatment suspension.A total of 93 eyes from 93 patients who had received a mean of 16 anti-VEGF injections over a mean of 962 (SD 562) days were included. Comparing the treatment suspension visit to 24 months later, no significant change in mean central foveal thickness (163 [SD 118, range 19-704] μm vs 164 [SD 217, range 19-1468], P = .97), greatest lesion diameter (2547 [SD 1294, range 134-5707] μm vs 2442 [SD 1158, range 421-5305] μm, P = .43), greatest lesion thickness (194 [SD 136, range 0-618] μm vs 205 [SD 131, range 0-573] μm, P = .40), or VA (1.87 [SD 0.37], 20/1482, vs 1.94 [SD 0.28], 20/1741, P = .16) was found. In total, 7 eyes (7.5%) restarted treatment following a mean of 977 (SD 450) days after treatment suspension.Suspension of anti-VEGF injections in eyes with advanced nAMD and VA ≤20/400 may be reasonable in cases where the treating physician deems additional treatment is unlikely to provide benefit.

Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT), simultaneous cataract extraction, and ellipsoid zone disruption preoperatively and at the final follow-up were compared.The mean age was 73.19 ± 7.26 years, and ten patients (62%) were females. The mean follow-up was 5.06±1.43 months (range 3-6). For all patients, BCVA was significantly improved at the final visit, from 0.65±0.36 logMAR units to 0.42±0.29 (p < 0.001). None of the patients had visual loss. Six patients had epiretinal membrane (ERM) foveoschisis, and the rest had LMH with epiretinal proliferation. Both subgroups presented a significant improvement in their BCVA with a trend for better improvement in the latter (p=0.09). Ellipsoid zone disruption was seen in 7 patients including one patient with a macular scar. There was no significant effect of ellipsoid zone disruption on the final BCVA (p=0.33). Twelve eyes (75%) underwent simultaneous cataract extraction. Mean BCVA at the final postoperative visit improved regardless of whether the eyes underwent simultaneous cataract surgery (p=0.39). CMT was also significantly improved at the final visit, from 200.06±46.8 μm preoperatively to 305.00±85.5 μm (p<0.001). No full-thickness macular holes were developed postoperatively.

Patients were managed by hospitals covering the publicly funded ophthalmology service in Hong Kong. Outcome measures included anterior segment examination and keratographic and meibographic imagings.A total of 64 worst-affected eyes of the 64 IgG4-ROD patients were analyzed. Corneal fluorescein staining (P = .0187), lid margin telangiectasia (P = .0360), lid-parallel conjunctival folds (P = .0112), papillae (P = .0393), meibomian gland plugging (P = .0001), meibomian gland expressibility (P = .0001), and meibum quality (P = .0001) were more significant in IgG4-ROD patients compared with healthy controls. Both upper and lower meibomian gland dropouts (P = .001 and .0003), and tear meniscus height (P = .0001) were higher in IgG4-ROD patients. Non-invasive tear break-up time (NITBUT) (P = .0166) and Schirmer test results (P = .0243) were lower in IgG4-ROD patients. Upper (r = 0.336, P = .0140) meibomian gland dropouts and NITBUT (r = -0.293, P = .0497) were positively and negatively correlated with the IgG4-ROD onset age, respectively. The number of extraocular organ involvement was negatively correlated with the Schirmer test(r = -0.341, P = .0167). Lower NITBUT was found in IgG4-ROD eyes with lacrimal gland enlargement than in IgG4-ROD eyes without lacrimal gland enlargement radiologically (P < .0001).IgG4-ROD patients showed features of both aqueous tear deficiency and evaporative dry eye disease.

Month 01 (M01) optical coherence tomography (OCT) images were analyzed using the following grading scheme: no infarction (grade 0), only middle retinal infarction (grade 1), diffuse middle and patchy inner retinal infarction (grade 2), and diffuse middle and inner retinal infarction (grade 3). Visual acuity letter score (VALS), central subfield thickness (CST), and number of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections were correlated with the infarction severity grade at month 01.More severe macular infarction, with both middle and inner retinal layer hyper-reflectivity (ie, grades 2 and 3), was associated with worse M00 VALS and was predictive of VALS at M01 to M60 (P < .001). More severe infarction was associated with greater CST at presentation; however, after the first anti-VEGF injection, CST decreased and was similar across all grades at all time points (P > .05) with similar number of injections.Participants with more severe macular infarction at M01, as graded with OCT, exhibited worse visual outcomes despite significantly improved macular edema from month 6 to 5 years.

After repeated pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), the surgeon effectively released the adhesion between the edges and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) by gently scraping the retinal neuroepithelium. Then, the hole was converted into a transverse slit, and the edges were gently tapped flat so that they attached to the RPE, and no space was left under the edges. Finally, air tamponade was carried out. The primary outcome measures included MH closure and the change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from preoperatively to postoperatively.The study included 11 PMH patients with a mean age of 63.82 ± 3.31 years. The mean minimum linear diameter of PMHs was 666.3 ± 208.1 μm, and the mean basal diameter was 1547.2 ± 351.8 μm. MH closure was achieved in 90.9% (10/11) of eyes, with significant improvement of visual acuity from 1.19 ± 0.30 logMAR to 0.65 ± 0.29 logMAR postoperatively.The releasing-closing-tapping approach with repeated PPV is a simple, effective, and safe surgical procedure for refractory PMHs after initial surgery with ILM peeling that can significantly improve the visual outcome and achieve a high surgical success rate.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,retinal disease,4

The associations between SSI and clinical factors, including age, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), media opacity severity, and central macular thickness (CMT), were evaluated both before and after injection.After injection, BCVA improved and CMT decreased significantly, and SSI increased significantly (p = 0.030). BCVA showed a significant positive correlation with media opacity severity before and after injection and with CMT only before injection. In the multivariate analysis, age, presence of DME, BCVA, and media opacity severity were negatively associated with SSI both before and after injection, while CMT was negatively associated with SSI only before injection. After injection, a negative correlation was found between SSI change and both BCVA and CMT change.Our findings suggest that OCTA SSI is influenced by various clinical factors, including age, visual acuity, media opacity severity, and macular thickening, especially in cases of DME. The results also indicate that SSI may decrease in patients with macular disorders due to the presence of macular edema and the associated decrease in visual acuity. Therefore, it is crucial to consider these factors when interpreting OCTA data and ensure an adequate level of SSI.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"diagnostic, effectiveness",,retinal disease,4

Patients without MA at baseline were analyzed to study the time to first MA development. Synchronous and unsynchronous time course of MA was also studied. MA was evaluated using near-infrared images, while all available optical coherence tomography (OCT) images were used to confirm the criteria proposed by the Classification of Atrophy Meetings group for complete MA.MA first detection in nAMD eyes increased significantly from year 2 to 6 compared to dAMD eyes. Over the study's follow-up, 45.1% of nAMD-E developed MA, compared to 16.5% of fellow eyes (p < 0.001). When MA in the two eyes was compared in a synchronous paired manner over 4 years, nAMD eyes had an average MA progression rate of 0.275 mm/year versus 0.110 mm/year in their fellow dAMD eyes. Multivariate ANOVA revealed significant time (p < 0.001), eye (p = 0.003), and time-eye interaction (p < 0.001) effects. However, when MA did develop in dAMD eyes and was compared in an asynchronous manner to MA of nAMD eyes, it was found to progress faster in dAMD eyes (dAMD: 0.295 mm/year vs. nAMD: 0.176 mm/year) with a significant time-eye interaction (p = 0.015).In this study, a significant difference in MA incidence and progression was documented in eyes with nAMD under treatment, compared to fellow eye exhibiting dAMD.

The CSC cohort was matched with a non-CSC cohort using the propensity score matching method, based on sex, age (in 10-year intervals), index date year, comorbidities, and steroid use, resulting in equal numbers of patients in both cohorts. Patients were followed up until 31 December 2019 or until they were withdrawn from the NHIRD. The incidence of glaucoma was compared between the two cohorts using the Cox regression model, and the risk of developing glaucoma was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.After adjusting for sex, age, comorbidities, and steroid use, the CSC cohort showed a significantly higher risk of developing glaucoma compared to those without CSC (adjusted HR = 3.99; 95% CI = 3.44-4.62). The cumulative incidence of glaucoma in the CSC cohort was also significantly higher than in the non-CSC cohort (log-rank test, p < 0.001). Among the glaucoma subtypes, normal tension glaucoma had the highest risk (adjusted HR = 5.79; 95% CI = 3.41-9.85), followed by primary open-angle glaucoma (adjusted HR = 2.77; 95% CI = 2.12-3.62).In conclusion, our study shows that CSC patients are at a higher risk of developing glaucoma, especially NTG.

The primary outcome measures were the final best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and severity of dry eye. The secondary outcome measure was the medical and surgical therapies used.Among 64 eyes of children recruited in the study, acute ocular involvement was found in 58 eyes (90.6%). The chronic score in pediatric patients was significantly higher than that in adult patients (P = .004). The use of antibiotics/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and Mycoplasma infection were the more common etiologies in children. In all, 75% of eyes in children maintained a visual acuity of 20/40 or better at a mean follow-up time of 4.3 years. The severity of dryness was comparable between the child and adult groups. The proportion of eyes undergoing amniotic membrane and oral mucosa transplantation was significantly higher in children than in adults in the chronic stage, reflecting that children exhibit much more severe complications.Although pediatric SJS/TEN patients have more severe ocular complications than adults, most children maintain long-term good vision.

2023-11-27,37635462,Monocyte/macrophage mediates the impact of depression on Crohn's disease.,"Depression increases the risk of Crohn's disease (CD) and worsens its prognosis. Monocytes/macrophages, immune modulate cells, play vital roles in both depression and CD.We investigated whether monocyte/macrophage could mediate the impact of depression on CD through induction of CD4 + T lymphocyte differentiation and epithelial barrier dysfunction, in addition to the alteration of their own phagocytic ability and cytokines production.Circulating monocytes and intestinal macrophages were isolated from eligible CD patients, divided into depressed and non-depressed groups. Phagocytosis was determined using flow cytometry while in vitro cytokine production was quantified using Luminex assay and qPCR. CD4 + T cells were cocultured with monocytes, then Type 1 Helper T Lymphocytes Th1/Type 2 Helper T Lymphocytes (Th2) /Type 17 Helper T Lymphocytes (Th17)/Treg subsets were analyzed using flow cytometry and qPCR. Caco-2 monolayers simulating epithelial barrier were cocultured with macrophages, and integrity and proliferation were evaluated. Tight junction protein expression was detected using immunofluorescence and western blot.Decreased monocyte/macrophage phagocytosis and enhanced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were revealed in the depressed versus non-depressed CD groups. Higher proportions of Th1 and Th17 cells with a lower proportion of Treg cell were observed after cocultured with monocytes from the depressed versus non-depressed CD patients. So were the expressions of their corresponding transcription factors T-bet, Retinoic Acid Related Orphan Nuclear Receptor gamma T (RORγt) and Forkhead box protein P3 (FoxP3). Caco-2 cells cocultured with macrophages from depressed CD displayed lower Transepithelial electric resistance (TEER), reduced proliferation activity, and decreased tight junction protein expressions compared with their counterpart cocultured with macrophages from non-depressed CD.Monocyte/macrophage may underlie the impact of depression upon CD via decreased phagocytosis, increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production, inducing CD4 + T cell differentiation toward Th1/Th17 cells rather than Treg cell, and impairing macrophage-enhanced epithelial barrier.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"biomarker, effectiveness",,crohn's disease,4

Clinical data, including demographic characteristics, lupus-related features, laboratory findings and ophthalmologic examinations, were collected and analyzed. The prognosis was evaluated based on best-corrected visual acuity and ophthalmologic outcomes.Seventeen SLE patients (32 eyes) diagnosed with PLR were included, along with a random selection of 100 SLE patients without retinopathy and 100 with retinal microvasculopathy as controls. Patients with PLR had a significantly younger age, a higher proportion of hemolytic anemia, a shorter duration of SLE, a higher SLE disease activity index-2000 (SLEDAI-2K) score, higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) values and lower hemoglobin (HGB) values than the group without retinopathy (P < 0.05). They also had a significantly higher SLEDAI-2K score, higher ESR values and higher white blood cell values (P < 0.05) than the Microvasculopathy group. The majority of eyes (22/26, 84.62%) achieved stabilization at the last follow-up, with different therapeutic strategies, while a few (4/26, 15.38%) experienced complications or progression.This is the largest reported case series of PLR in SLE, which was associated with higher disease activity and poor visual prognosis.

2023-11-27,37724478,Potential missed diagnoses of Crohn's disease in tertiary care: impact on drug utilization and healthcare facilities use.,"A missed diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD) can delay treatment initiation with consequences on disease course.To measure the possible impact of missed diagnoses on drug utilization and access to healthcare facilities in a real-world cohort of CD patients.This retrospective observational study has been conducted on the regional administrative databases of Tuscany (Italy). We included patients with a first record of CD diagnosis between 06/11/2011 and 06/30/2016. Possible missed diagnosis (exposure) was defined by hospital presentation for gastrointestinal symptoms consistent with CD diagnosis that occurred in the 7-60 months preceding CD diagnosis. We compared exposed and non-exposed patients by assessing time-free from biologic drugs and from Emergency Department (ED) or hospital access. Hazard ratio (HR) was calculated using Cox models.Among 3342 CD patients, 584 (17.5%) had a possible missed diagnosis. A risk of being treated with biologic drugs [adjusted HR (aHR): 2.17, 95% CI: 1.75-2.71] and of access to ED or hospitalization (aHR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.44-1.75) was observed in patients with a possible missed diagnosis as compared to those without.Tertiary care caregivers should be trained in the identification of early CD symptoms, to timely identify CD diagnosis and optimize pharmacological treatment and disease management.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,crohn's disease,4
2023-11-27,37728695,Corticosteroid Use and Adherence in Patients Treated with Acthar Gel for Advanced Sarcoidosis.,"Long-term corticosteroid use in immune-mediated diseases is associated with increased risk of adverse events (AEs) and worsened health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Previous studies report chronic high-dose corticosteroid therapy results in higher rates of healthcare resource use and AE-related medical costs. Recent studies suggest Acthar® Gel (repository corticotropin injection) is an effective steroid-sparing therapy for sarcoidosis. This study compares the corticosteroid-sparing effect between Acthar Gel and comparators and evaluates the impact of Acthar Gel adherence on reduction of corticosteroid burden.A retrospective analysis of a large administrative pharmacy and medical claims database (Symphony Health Solutions) was conducted. Patients were included with confirmed ICD-9/10 diagnosis for sarcoidosis in the study period (2014-2020), followed by ≥ 2 Acthar Gel claims or comparators (janus kinase inhibitor (JAKi)/rituximab), ≥ 18 years old, with 12 months coverage pre/post index. Outcomes were compared as change from baseline. Acthar Gel adherence was determined by proportion of days covered in the follow-up period.The Acthar Gel (n = 735) and comparator (n = 626) cohorts were mostly female (68-72%) between 55 and 58 years old. Compared to the comparator cohort at baseline, Acthar Gel patients had greater any corticosteroid use (80% vs. 56%, p < 0.001), extended use (61% vs. 32%, p < 0.001), and mean average daily dose (6.72 vs. 3.03, p < 0.001). After treatment, Acthar Gel patients had greater reduction from baseline in any corticosteroid use (- 9.0% vs. - 3.2%) and extended use (- 10.0% vs. - 3.0%). In the Acthar Gel adherence cohorts, patients with above average adherence had greater reduction in both measures (- 11.2% vs. - 6.1%; - 11.6% vs. - 7.6%, respectively) than patients with below average adherence. Acthar Gel patients had greater reduction of extended use at all dose levels.Acthar Gel is associated with reductions in corticosteroid use compared to alternatives. Better adherence is associated with greater reduction in corticosteroid exposure. Key Summary Points.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,sarcoidosis,4
2023-11-27,37738268,ctDNA-guided adjuvant treatment after radical-intent treatment of metastatic spread from colorectal cancer-the first interim results from the OPTIMISE study.,"Patients with detectable ctDNA after radical-intent treatment of metastatic spread from colorectal cancer (mCRC) have a very high risk of recurrence, which may be prevented with intensified adjuvant chemotherapy (aCTh). In the OPTIMISE study, we investigate ctDNA-guided aCTh after radical-intent treatment of mCRC. Here we present results from the preplanned interim analysis.The study is an open-label 1:1 randomized clinical trial comparing ctDNA-guided aCTh against standard of care (SOC), with a run-in phase investigating feasibility measures. Key inclusion criteria; radical-intent treatment for mCRC and clinically eligible for triple-agent chemotherapy. Patients underwent a PET-CT scan before randomization. ctDNA analyses of plasma samples were done by ddPCR, detecting CRC-specific mutations and methylation of the NPY gene. In the ctDNA-guided arm, ctDNA positivity led to an escalation strategy with triple-agent chemotherapy, and conversely ctDNA negativity led to a de-escalation strategy by shared-decision making. Patients randomized to the standard arm were treated according to SOC. Feasibility measures for the run-in phase were; the inclusion of 30 patients over 12 months in two Danish hospitals, compliance with randomization >80%, rate of PET-CT-positive findings <20%, and eligibility for triple-agent chemotherapy >80%.Thirty-two patients were included. The rate of PET-CT-positive cases was 22% (n = 7/32). Ninety-seven percent of the patients were randomized. Fourteen patients were randomly assigned to SOC and sixteen to ctDNA-guided adjuvant treatment and follow-up. All analyses of baseline plasma samples in the ctDNA-guided arm passed the quality control, and 19% were ctDNA positive. The median time to result was three working days. All ctDNA-positive patients were eligible for triple-agent chemotherapy.The study was proven to be feasible and continues in the planned large-scale phase II trial. Results from the OPTIMISE study will potentially optimize the adjuvant treatment of patients undergoing radical-intent treatment of mCRC, thereby improving survival and reducing chemotherapy-related toxicity.",no,yes,no,human RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,colorectal cancer,4
2023-11-27,37751404,Cross-sectional Study Exploring Vision-related Quality of Life in Dry Eye Disease in a Norwegian Optometric Practice.,"Dry eye disease causes ocular pain, blurred vision, reduced visual quality of life, and reduced workplace performance. This disease is underreported and underdiagnosed despite being highly prevalent in optometric care.This study aimed to explore the vision-related quality of life of patients with dry eye disease and the potential benefits of screening for dry eye disease in Norwegian optometric practice.This study adopted an observational, prospective, cross-sectional design. All patients between 18 and 70 years of age who were examined between June 8 and July 5, 2018, at Erøy Optikk, Kristiansand, Norway, were invited to participate. Dry eye disease was assessed according to Tear Film & Ocular Surface Society International Dry Eye Workshop II report recommendations. Vision-related quality of life was assessed with the National Eye Institute 25-item Visual Function Questionnaire.Forty-nine patients participated in the study; 29 (59%) were female, and 29 (59%) had dry eye disease. The patients with dry eye disease reported significantly more ocular pain and (vision-specific) role difficulties than the patients without dry eye disease. After adjusting for age, sex, and habitual visual acuity, dry eye disease was found to be an independent predictor of both ocular pain ( r2 = 0.328, P = .001) and (vision-specific) role difficulties ( r2 = 0.240, P = .02). Both habitual visual acuity and dry eye disease were predictors of reduced general vision, a reduced score for near activity and reduced (vision-specific) mental health.Dry eye disease was an independent predictor of ocular pain (vision-specific), role difficulties, and reduced general vision, near vision, and (vision-specific) mental health. Optometrists should consider dry eye disease as a cause of reduced vision and quality of vision. Furthermore, we propose that screening for dry eye disease in Norwegian optometric practice can promote better vision and health among patients.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,effectiveness,,dry eye,4
2023-11-27,37831183,Real-world efficacy and safety of advanced therapies in hospitalized patients with ulcerative colitis.,"This multicenter observational cohort study aimed to evaluate the utilization and short-term efficacy of advanced therapy (AT) in hospitalized patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC).In total, 221 patients with ASUC were enrolled between August 2020 and July 2021. The primary endpoint was clinical remission (CR, defined as a patient-reported outcome score < 2 with no blood in the stool) rate on Day 7 and 14 in hospitalized patients who received corticosteroids (CS) and AT.Among patients with ASUC, 120 and 101 patients received CS or any AT as first-line treatment, respectively. The CR rates on Day 7 and 14 were 22.5% and 35.0%, respectively, in hospitalized patients who received CS as first-line treatment. Most patients who used ATs had CS-dependent or frequent recurrences. Eight different ATs (apheresis, tacrolimus, infliximab, golimumab, tofacitinib, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and cyclosporine) were used as first-line treatment in patients with ASUC, and the CR rates on Day 7 and 14 were 16.8% and 29.7%, respectively. Twenty-five patients received the second ATs after hospitalizations, and the CR rates on Day 7 and 14 were 0% and 12%, respectively. The CR rates on Day 14 were significantly higher in patients who changed to AT than in those whose dose of CS increased (34.0% vs 10.7%, p = 0.020) among patients who had already used CS before hospitalization.Most first-use ATs were effective for patients with ASUC, while second-use ATs might have had limited benefits in inducing CR.

2023-11-27,37832156,Minimal Posterior Pole Vitrectomy and Fixing the Inverted Internal Limiting Membrane Flap with DisCoVisc for Macular Hole: No Gas or Air Tamponade.,"To investigate an alternative surgical method for macular hole repair without fluid-air exchange, gas tamponade, and prone positioning.Eighteen eyes of 17 patients with macular holes underwent minimal posterior pole vitrectomy with an inverted internal limiting membrane flap technique. Ophthalmic viscosurgical device was used to fix the inverted internal limiting membrane flap in the balanced salt solution. No fluid-air exchange, gas tamponade, or prone positioning was needed. Follow-ups were performed at 1 day, 1 week, and the last visit (ranging from 3 to 6 months) after surgery. Optical coherence tomography examination, intraocular pressure, and best-corrected visual acuity measurements were performed preoperatively and at every follow-up, postoperatively.Primary closure of the macular hole was observed in all 18 eyes (100%). Optical coherence tomography showed U-type closure in 12 eyes, V-type closure in five eyes, and W-type closure in one eye. Preoperative, postoperative 1 week, and last follow-up best-corrected visual acuity were 0.90 (Snellen equivalent 20/159) ± 0.31 LogMAR, 0.72 (Snellen equivalent 20/105) ± 0.33 LogMAR, and 0.48 (Snellen equivalent 20/60) ± 0.32 LogMAR, respectively. Postoperative visual acuity was significantly improved compared with preoperative values ( F = 19.250, P = 0.000). No significant difference in intraocular pressure was found compared with preoperative values ( F = 1.933, P = 0.168). No significant complications were observed.This surgical method can effectively close macular holes, improve visual acuity, enhance surgical efficiency, reduce surgical complications, and improve patients' postoperative experience without the need for fluid-air exchange, gas tamponade, or prone positioning.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,retinal disease,4
2023-11-27,37865012,The inflammatory potential of diet is associated with the risk of age-related eye diseases.,"Inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of cataract, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and possibly open-angle glaucoma (OAG). We assessed whether the inflammatory potential of diet (quantified using the dietary inflammatory index; DII) affects the incidence of these common blinding age-related eye diseases. Serum inflammation markers were investigated as possible mediators.Participants aged >45 years were selected from the prospective, population-based Rotterdam Study. From 1991 onwards, every 4-5 years, participants underwent extensive eye examinations. At baseline, blood samples and dietary data (using food frequency questionnaires) were collected. The DII was adapted based on the data available. Of the 7436 participants free of eye diseases at baseline, 4036 developed incident eye diseases during follow-up (cataract = 2895, early-intermediate AMD = 891, late AMD = 81, OAG = 169).The adapted DII (aDII) ranged from -4.26 (i.e., anti-inflammatory) to 4.53 (i.e., pro-inflammatory). A higher aDII was significantly associated with increased inflammation. A higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was associated with an increased risk of cataract and AMD. Additionally, complement component 3c (C3c) and systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) were associated with increased risks of cataract and late AMD, respectively. Every point increase in the aDII was associated with a 9% increased risk of cataract (Odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 1.09 [1.04-1.14]). The NLR and C3c partly mediated this association. We also identified associations of the aDII with risk of AMD (early-intermediate AMD, OR [95% CI]: 1.11 [1.03-1.19]; late AMD, OR [95% CI]: 1.24 [1.02-1.53]). The NLR partly mediated these associations. The aDII was not associated with OAG.A pro-inflammatory diet was associated with increased risks of cataract and AMD. Particularly the NLR, a marker of subclinical inflammation, appears to be implicated. These findings are relevant for patients with AMD and substantiate the current recommendations to strive for a healthy lifestyle to prevent blindness.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, biomarker",,"retinopathy, retinal disease",4
2023-11-27,37884062,Association of BMI and waist circumference with diabetic microvascular complications: A prospective cohort study from the UK Biobank and Mendelian randomization analysis.,"To investigate the precise association between BMI and waist circumference (WC) and diabetic complications, including retinopathy (DR), nephropathy (DN) and peripheral neuropathy (DPN).A multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazard model was used to evaluate the observed association from 30,541 UK Biobank participants with diabetes. A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) framework was applied to summary-level GWASs of BMI and WC comprising a total of 461,460 and 462,166 participants from UK Biobank to explore the potential causal association.Higher BMI and WC were associated with increased risks of DR, DN, and DPN (HR (95% CI), per-SD increase: BMI: DR 1.09 (1.04-1.13), DN 1.37 (1.33-1.41), DPN 1.27 (1.20-1.34); WC: DR 1.11 (1.07-1.16), DN 1.41 (1.36-1.46), DPN 1.38 (1.30-1.45)) in the UK Biobank cohort. Univariate MR indicated that increased BMI and WC were causal risk factors for these complications (OR (95% CI), per-SD increase: BMI: DR 1.33 (1.22-1.45), DN 1.74 (1.47-2.07), DPN 2.20 (1.67-2.90); WC: DR 1.43 (1.27-1.61), DN 2.03 (1.62-2.55), DPN 2.80 (1.99-3.92)), and the effect sizes remained significant after adjustment for glycated hemoglobin.Prospective observational and MR analyses provided evidence that high BMI and WC may represent potential causal risk factors for diabetic microvascular complications.

2023-11-27,37926115,Effects of body weight variability on risks of macro- and microvascular outcomes in individuals with type 2 diabetes: The Rio de Janeiro type 2 diabetes cohort.,"To investigate the effects of body weight variability (BWV) on macro- and microvascular outcomes in a type 2 diabetes cohort.BWV parameters were assessed in 684 individuals. Multivariable Cox regressions examined associations between BWV parameters and cardiovascular outcomes (total cardiovascular events [CVEs], major CVEs [MACEs], cardiovascular deaths),all-cause mortality and microvascular outcomes. Interaction/subgroup analyses were performed according to being physically-active/sedentary and having/not lost ≥ 5 % of weight.Median follow-up was 11 years over which 194 total CVEs (174 MACEs), and 223 all-cause deaths (110 cardiovascular), occurred. There were 215 renal, 152 retinopathy and 167 peripheral neuropathy development/worsening outcomes. In general, increased BWV was associated with higher risks of CVEs, MACEs, all-cause mortality, advanced renal failure and peripheral neuropathy outcomes, but not of microalbuminuria and retinopathy outcomes. On interaction/subgroup analyses, increased BWV was associated with higher risks of outcomes in sedentary individuals and in those who did not lose ≥ 5 % of body weight. In physically-active participants or in those who lost ≥ 5 % weight, the adjusted risks were null or protective.Increased BWV was associated with most adverse outcomes; however, in those who were physically-active or consistently losing weight, it was not hazardous and might be even beneficial.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,retinopathy,4
2023-11-27,37968276,Evaluation of retinal vascularization in retinopathy of prematurity regressed after intravitreal ranibizumab monotherapy or without treatment based on fluorescein angiography.,"To investigate the fluorescein angiography (FA) findings and compare the extent of retinal vascularization in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), recovered after intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR) monotherapy and those regressed spontaneously. Infants with a history of ROP who underwent FA between April 2018 and November 2021 were retrospectively included. The patients were divided into two groups based on whether they had received IVR (IVR group) or had ROP that regressed spontaneously without treatment (untreated group). The differences between the two groups in zone II ROP were also compared, to equalize the subgroups as much as possible in terms of disease severity. FA findings were recorded. The extent of vascularization was measured by the ratio of the distance from the center of the disk to the border of the vascularized zone (DB) and the distance from the center of the disk to the center of the fovea (DF). The width of the persistent avascular retina (PAR) was counted by disc diameters (DD). One hundred and ten eyes of 55 infants were included in the IVR group and 76 eyes of 38 babies in the untreated group. The ratio of abnormal shape of vessels was significantly higher in the IVR group than in the untreated group (50.9% vs. 35.5%; P = 0.038), while the linear choroidal filling pattern, tortuosity of vessels over the posterior pole, dye leakage, anomalous branching of vessels, circumferential vessels, arteriovenous shunt, abnormal capillary bed, and macular abnormalities were similarly. There was a smaller temporal DB/DF ratio (4.48 vs. 4.63; P = 0.003) and greater PAR (2.63 vs. 1.76; P < 0.001) in the IVR group compared to the untreated group. In zone II ROP, the progression of retinal vascularization was significantly larger in the IVR group than that in the untreated group (P = 0.003), while no statistical differences were observed in FA features, the DB/DF ratio, and PAR between the two subgroups. The residual vascular abnormalities and PAR may be common results of ROP regression. The DB/DF ratio of 4.0 temporally and 3.3 nasally could be used as the preliminary indicators for safe retinal vascularization in the completion of ROP regression.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,retinopathy,4

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term impacts on healthcare service in Chinese IBD patients under the dynamic zero-COVID strategy. The study was performed in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Quality of Care Centers in mainland China in 2021. The data about the healthcare was collected by a 44-item questionnaire. Totally 463 were from ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and 538 from Crohn's disease (CD) patients were included in the study. The pandemic impacted 37.5% patients on their treatment, and the biggest problem was unable to follow up timely (77.9%). There was a significant increase in healthcare costs in CD (P < 0.001) and no significant change in UC (P = 0.14) after the outbreak. Both UC and CD had an increase in the frequency of outpatient visits (UC 5.07 vs. 4.54, P = 0.001; CD 6.30 vs. 5.76, P = 0.002), and hospitalizations (UC 1.30 vs. 1.02, P < 0.001; CD 3.55 vs. 2.78, P < 0.001). The hospitalization rate in UC reduced slightly (40.2% vs. 42.8%, P = 0.423) after the outbreak, but it significantly increased in CD (75.8% vs. 67.8%, P = 0.004).

Patients diagnosed with large macular hole (MH) (minimum diameter > 500 μm) between 2018 and 2021 were enrolled. All patients underwent 25-gauge pars plana vitrectomy, internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling and air tamponade. Spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were measured in preoperative and 2-week post-operative. Classic and angle related parameters were measured via ImageJ. Angle regularity (AR) were defined as the standard deviation of the angle parameters in vertical and horizontal direction.Seventy-six eyes were included for analysis; 24 eyes showed an unclosed macular hole at the 2-week postoperative and 52 eyes showed a closed hole. Preoperatively, MLD (P < 0.001), BD (P = 0.009) and diameter of EZ/ELM disruption (P = 0.002 and 0.025) in patients failed to close the hole after primary surgery were significantly larger than those succeeded. EZ-MH (P = 0.018), EZ-NFL (P = 0.006), EZ-GCL (P = 0.004), EZ-INL (P = 0.002), EZ-OPL (P = 0.009) and EZ-ONL (P = 0.011) angles were smaller in patients with unclosed hole. AR of the EZ-NFL (P = 0.009), EZ-GCL (P = 0.009), EZ-OPL (P = 0.023), EZ-ONL (P = 0.048) and Basal-NFL (P = 0.030) angles among the unclosed patients were significantly larger than those of the closed group. EZ-NFL (P = 0.015), EZ-GCL (P = 0.004), EZ-INL (P < 0.001), EZ-OPL (P < 0.001), EZ-ONL (P < 0.001), Basal (P = 0.023) and Basal-NFL (P < 0.001) angles of hole-unclosed patients enlarged significantly after the surgery.Patients with large macular holes and an increased EZ-related angle and angle AR are more likely to experience unsuccessful outcomes following primary MH surgery.

Patients received anterior/pars plana vitrectomy and concurrent Yamane's IOL fixation. Main outcome measures were postoperative BCVA and surgical complications. Proportion of spontaneous PVD and preoperative undetected retinal holes/degeneration (PURH/D) were recorded.Twenty-four eyes were treated with anterior vitrectomy (Group AnV) and 32 eyes with pars plana vitrectomy (Group PPV). Overall incidence of PURH/D was 10.7% (6/56). Spontaneous PVD occurred in 68.8% (24/32) in Group PPV. During six months follow-up, one case of postoperative RRD and one case of choroidal detachment occurred in Group AnV. There was no significant difference between anterior vitrectomy and PPV in the final BCVA and postoperative complications.Anterior or pars plana vitrectomy, which are both applicable in YAMANE technique for crystalline lens dislocation, exhibit similar surgical outcomes. Patient's age, PVD status and PURH helps to determine the route of vitrectomy. Pediatric patients might be potential candidates for transcorneal vitreolensectomy.

Silicon hydrogel (SiH) contact lenses have been extensively used in clinical ophthalmologic medicine, as a postoperative ophthalmological intervention. However, the ideal lens application duration after transepithelial CXL remains uncertain. Here, we aimed to investigate the effects and comfort of immediate corneal contact lens use after transepithelial CXL for keratoconus.In this prospective study, 60 patients with keratoconus who underwent transepithelial CXL treatment were enrolled from September 2021 to January 2023 with a male:female ratio of 39:21, and an average age of 25.42 ± 5.47 years. The patients were divided randomly into two groups: group A contained 30 patients wearing silicone hydrogel contact lenses for 7 days postoperatively, and group B contained 30 patients wearing the same contact lenses for 3 days. Ten subjective ophthalmologic symptoms were surveyed by the patients, including pain, photophobia, foreign body sensation, tearing, burning, blurred vision, dry eyes, difficulty opening the eyes, astringency, and stinging. Ophthalmologic signs, including corneal edema and conjunctival congestion, were recorded by a single clinician on postoperative days 1, 3, and 7.Each surgical procedure was readily performed without complications, and both groups postoperative day 7 (P = 0.04), where group B scored (0.01 ± 0.41) lesser than group A (0.12 ± 0.29), whilst corneal edema in both groups recorded significantly different on postoperative days 5 and 7 (group A demonstrated the result of 0.17 ± 0.14 and 0.08 ± 0.11 for the respective days, whereas group B indicated 0.10 ± 0.13 and 0.03 ± 0.07 at the corresponding times).Immediate use of silicone hydrogel corneal lenses after transepithelial CXL effectively alleviates postoperative ocular distress, particularly with a three-day use period as the ideal duration.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,retinal disease,4
2023-11-27,37988106,The Impact of Diabetic Retinopathy on the Choriocapillaris in Neovascular AMD.,"To investigate the impact of diabetic retinopathy (DR) on morphological choriocapillaris (CC) modifications in eyes with type 1 macular neovascularization (MNV) secondary to AMD using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA).Eyes with AMD-related type 1 MNV with and without DR were prospectively included. We performed 3 × 3 mm OCTA scans at two visits: before the loading phase of intravitreal injections of aflibercept (T1) and 1 month after the last injection (T2). OCTA En face flow images of the CC were analyzed for flow deficit percentage (FD%), FD average area and FD number in a 500-µm-wide ring surrounding the dark halo (DH) around type 1 MNV.A total of 65 eyes, out of which 30 eyes had mild DR, were included. In the group without diabetes, there was a gradual reduction in FD% in the CC ring around the DH after antiangiogenic therapy, indicating reperfusion of the CC (P = 0.003). However, in the DR group, there were no significant changes in CC parameters between the two study visits. Specifically, the FD% in the CC ring around the DH did not show a significant reduction at T2 compared with T1 values (P > 0.05). Furthermore, the comparison of the variation in FD% between the two groups was statistically significant. The nondiabetic group exhibited a gradual CC reperfusion after the loading phase of aflibercept, whereas the diabetic eyes did not show significant changes (P = 0.029).The CC surrounding the DH associated to type 1 MNV exhibited greater hypoperfusion in diabetic eyes compared with eyes without diabetes, both before starting therapy and after the loading phase.

2023-11-27,37990156,Clinical importance of weight gain and associated factors in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: results from the MOSAIK cohort in Korea.,"Many patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) gain weight after treatment. However, the clinical significance of weight gain in these patients remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate body weight changes after treatment in patients newly diagnosed with moderate-to-severe UC and their effects on patients' prognosis.The change in weight between diagnosis and 1 year after treatment in 212 patients enrolled in the MOSAIK cohort (mean age, 40 years; males, 60%) was analyzed. Significant weight gain was defined as a weight increase of ≥ 5% from the baseline at 1 year. Factors associated with significant weight gain and the effect of significant weight gain on the risk of major adverse outcomes (clinical relapse, hospitalization, and new use of steroids or biologics) during a follow-up period of 20 months were evaluated.Mean weight gain at 1 year was 1.7 ± 4.2 kg. The proportion of overweight/obese patients increased by 9.0% from 37.9% to 46.9%. Thirty-two percent had significant weight gain; extensive colitis at diagnosis was the only factor associated with significant weight gain (odds ratio 6.5, 95% confidence interval 1.4-31.0, p = 0.006). In multivariable analysis, significant weight gain was not associated with the risk of major adverse outcomes. Weight loss symptoms at diagnosis were associated with an increased risk for new steroid use after 1 year.Approximately one-third of patients with moderate-to-severe UC had significant weight gain after 1 year of treatment.

A Medline search was done (key words like central retinal artery occlusion, blunt trauma, children, pediatric subjects, and adolescents) to gather information available in the literature on the subject.A total of 11 patients (11 eyes), mean age of 14.3 ± 3.4 years, and 100% male preponderance, with an average time duration from trauma to presentation to the hospital of 8.1 days were included. Visual acuity ranged from no light perception (four eyes) to finger count at a 1 m distance. Intraocular pressure was raised in three patients, of which two were suffering from sickle cell disease. In two eyes, the CRAO coexisted with optic nerve avulsion and the cilioretinal artery was spared. Disk pallor was seen in six eyes as early as 12 days from the trauma. None of the cases revealed any bony fracture in the CT scan.CRAO was observed to be an important primary or contributory cause of visual loss in children following blunt trauma, reflex vasospasm being the most common etiology. Early onset disk pallor could suggest an underlying vascular compromise of both retinal and optic disk circulation in addition to direct disk damage.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,retinal disease,4

A man in his early 50s visited our hospital because of vision loss in his right eye. His logarithmic best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was -0.79 in both eyes. ME due to superior temporal BRVO was observed in his right eye, and the central foveal thickness (CFT) was 486 µm. The patient was treated with an intravitreal aflibercept injection with logarithmic BCVA of -0.79, leading to resolution of the ME with a CFT of 299 µm. Three months after the initial visit, he received a fourth dose of an mRNA vaccine. Three days later, he developed vision loss in his right eye. Although the logarithmic BCVA was maintained at -0.79, ME recurred with a CFT of 507 µm. The patient was treated with an additional dose of intravitreal aflibercept injection. The ME resolved and the logarithmic BCVA in the right eye was maintained at -0.79.

There is a lack of prospective studies regarding the diet of children with IBD. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency and impact of self-imposed elimination diets on the nutritional status and clinical course of disease in the pediatric population.This was a prospective case-control study that included newly diagnosed patients with IBD and healthy controls (age/sex-matched peers and siblings) over a one-year period. The participants were examined in three categories: (1) anthropometric data and nutritional status; (2) dietary intake, as obtained by a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ); and (3) dietary beliefs and elimination diets, as obtained by a structured questionnaire.Overall, one-hundred and thirty-seven participants were included (twenty-eight with Crohn's disease, sixteen with ulcerative colitis, three with IBD-unclassified, and seventy healthy controls). Only 15% of patients followed the self-imposed elimination diet upon the diagnosis, which increased to 47.6% by the end of the follow-up. The elimination diet did not influence the nutritional status and quality of the diet. Self-imposed elimination diets were not a risk factor for disease relapse. Most of the patients received nutritional counseling during the follow-up.The number of patients following self-imposed elimination diets had increased during the disease course but with no influence on nutritional status or relapse risk.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",4
2023-11-27,38004241,The Role of Vitamin D in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease Treated with Vedolizumab.,"Many clinical factors can contribute to the efficacy of medical therapy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). We assessed their effects on the efficacy of vedolizumab therapy in a cohort of patients with IBD.We conducted a retrospective study on patients between 18 and 80 years of age with ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) who were seen in the IBD program at Houston Methodist in Houston, TX and treated with vedolizumab for at least 6 months from 2018 to 2022. We investigated factors prior to the initiation of therapy that best predicted treatment response, with an emphasis on vitamin D levels and examined several variables including patients' demographics and clinical information on disease location and severity and nutritional status before and after the initiation of vedolizumab. Post-treatment data were gathered after a minimum of 6 months of vedolizumab therapy. The clinical parameters used for the study were the Harvey-Bradshaw Index for CD and the Activity Index for UC.There were 88 patients included in our study of whom 44 had CD and 44 had UC.; median age was 39.5 (31.0, 53.25) years; 34% patients were male; and 80.7% were Caucasian. All patients received an induction dosing of 300 mg vedolizumab at 0, 2, and 6 weeks then maintenance dosing as standard of care every 8 weeks. Among UC patients with vitamin D ≥ 30 ng/mL at the initiation of vedolizumab therapy, UC Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS) scores after 6 months of therapy were significantly lower than in those who had low pre-treatment vitamin D levels (1.5 vs. 3.87, p = 0.037). After treatment, vitamin D levels improved more significantly in the higher pre-treatment vitamin D group, with a median level of 56 ng/mL, than in the lower pre-treatment vitamin D group, with a median level of only 31 ng/mL (p = 0.007). In patients with CD with vitamin D ≥ 30 ng/mL at the initiation of vedolizumab therapy, we found higher iron saturation (12 vs. 25%, p = 0.008) and higher vitamin B12 levels (433.5 vs. 885 pg/mL, p = 0.003) than in those with vitamin D < 30 ng/mL. After treatment, CD patients with high pre-treatment vitamin D levels had significantly higher vedolizumab levels (27.35 vs. 14.35 μg/mL, p = 0.045) than those with low pre-treatment vitamin D. Post-treatment scores and inflammatory markers in CD patients (HBI, CRP, ESR, and SES-CD) were lower in those who had lower baseline vitamin D.Our results show higher pre-treatment vitamin D levels predicted significant endoscopic improvement in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Improving vitamin D levels lowered C-reactive protein levels significantly in CD patients. Higher vitamin D levels were seen after treatment in both UC and CD patients. Vitamin D can play a role in clinical and endoscopic outcomes and should be assessed routinely and optimized in patients with IBD.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, biomarker",,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",4

The aim of this study was to report a case series of SMGT with the special focus on monitoring and management of postoperative vascular compromise.Using a retrospective single-cohort study design, the investigators enrolled a sample of DED patients undergoing SMGT in a Chinese university hospital during 1999 and 2021. The main outcomes were baseline and surgical data, post-operative manifestations, and surgical results. Descriptive, uni- and bivariate statistics were computed with the significant P < 0.05.During the study period, 220 DED patients (55.9% female) with a mean age of 32.66±14.47 years underwent SMGT. Vascular compromises occurred in 27 grafted glands (12.3%; 22 venous compromises and 5 arterial compromises) at a median of 27 h(range, 3.3 to 288 h) after surgery. Harden texture and swelling of the covering skin flap of the donor indicated venous compromises, while some specific sign was absent for arterial compromise. The accompanying vein of the facial artery (FAV) as a donor's vein was associated with less vascular compromise compared to the anterior facial vein (AFV). Timely reexploration was performed in 25 glands (92.6%), with a salvaged rate of 48%, and more venous compromises were salvaged compared to artery compromises (54.6% vs. 0%, P = 0.047). Temporary hypersecretion on postoperative 2-5 days was noticed in the grafted glands with no or salvaged vascular compromise (Schirmer's test, 35 mm/5 min and 37 mm/5 min, respectively, P = 0.749), while they were absent for the 15 surgically failed grands (Schirmer's test 0 mm/5 min, P<0.001).Vascular compromise appears to be a common complication of SMGT. Postoperative hypersecretion of the grafted glands may indicate good circulation, and the use of FAV as the donor's vein could help to decrease the risk of vascular compromise.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,dry eye,4
2023-11-28,37949754,Adverse events from HPV vaccination in Taiwan.,"The safety of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines has been evaluated continuously in pre-licensure clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance systems, and observational studies. Most studies have found no significant association between serious adverse events and HPV vaccination. However, these studies have focused on Western populations; similar studies focusing on Asian populations are insufficient. Our retrospective cohort study used the HPV-vaccination records of junior high-school adolescent girls aged 12-15 years between 2013 and 2018 in Taiwan's National Immunization Information System and linked them to a registry for beneficiaries in Taiwan's National Health Insurance Database (NHID) to establish the vaccinated group. We selected 19 serious diseases as serious adverse events. We compared the incidence rates of these serious adverse events between the vaccinated group and girls in the same age group population, and we calculated the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) to evaluate the risk of serious adverse events after HPV vaccination. Because of the onset of different types of diseases, we set three periods after the subjects received HPV vaccination: within 3 months, within 1 year, and during the study period (2013-2018). The results showed the incidence rates and the SIRs of 19 selected adverse events. Among the 19 selected serious adverse events, the disease with the highest incidence rate during the study period was fibromyalgia (73.23 cases per million population), and the disease with the lowest incidence rate during the study period was Crohn's disease (0.15 cases per million population). The results showed no statistically significant increases in the risk of 19 selected serious adverse events and indicated no association between HPV vaccination and serious adverse events. Given the benefits and safety of HPV vaccination, our research can reduce concerns about vaccine side effects, inform health policies and improve public and clinician's acceptance of HPV vaccine policy.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,safety,,crohn's disease,4

Patients were randomized into two treatment arms: bilateral ULB using the orbicularis-sparing technique or bilateral ULB using the orbicularis-excising technique. One subjective and seven objective DES assessments were performed on all patients preoperatively and 1 month and 1 year after surgery.A total of 63 patients were recruited for the study. Standard Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness (SPEED) scores decreased in both treatment groups at 1 month and 1 year postoperatively. This change did not significantly vary based on surgical technique. Objective DES assessments were not significantly changed at both postoperative time points for either group. There was a correlation between the severity of preoperative DES symptoms and the subjective improvement of DES symptoms postoperatively in both groups.ULB with an orbicularis-sparing or orbicularis-excising technique does not worsen subjective or objective DES metrics and so, surgeons may confidently use either surgical technique.

Recent efforts to improve pouch outcomes have seen a push towards centralisation of surgery. This study aimed to document outcomes following pouch surgery at a population level within New South Wales (NSW), and identify factors associated with, and temporal trends of these outcomes.A retrospective data linkage study of the NSW population over a 19-year period was performed. The primary outcome was pouch failure in patients with UC who underwent IPAA. The influence of hospital level factors (including annual volume) and patient demographic variables on this outcome were assessed using Cox proportional hazards modelling. Temporal trends in annual volume and evidence for centralisation over the studied period were assessed using Poisson regression analysis.The annual volume of UC pouches reduced over the study period. The pouch failure rates were 8.6% (95% CI 6.3-10.8%) and 10.6% (95% CI 8.0-13.1%) at 5- and 10-years, respectively. Increasing age and non-elective admission were associated with higher failure rates. One-third of UC pouches (31.6%) were performed in a single institution, which averaged 6.5 pouches/year throughout the study period. Three-quarters (19/25) of NSW public hospitals who performed pouches performed less than one UC pouch annually.The outcomes following UC pouch surgery in NSW are comparable with global standards.

The patients were divided into two groups: a control group (comprising 40 eyes treated with an alternating unilateral regimen) and a study group (comprising 90 eyes treated with concomitant bilateral DEX implants). All patients were followed up monthly after implantation. The changes in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT) from baseline to sixth month after implantation, and ocular adverse effects such as intraocular pressure, cataract, and tolerability of bilateral implantation were reviewed. The primary endpoint was to assess the safety of the same-day bilateral treatment protocol. The secondary endpoints focused on evaluating the functional and anatomical changes associated with bilateral simultaneous or alternating implantations.At 6 months after implantation, mean BCVA increased and CRT decreased in both groups. Moreover, no serious ocular adverse effects were observed. In addition, no differences were observed between the two groups in the number of patients who required extra follow-up visits or the number of extra visits made in addition to the treatment schedule.Same-day bilateral intravitreal DEX implants are associated with a low complication rate and are well tolerated by patients.

The template was fitted with a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the latent RGC density in patients with glaucoma and age-matched controls. We tested two alternative hypotheses: fitting the data by translating the template horizontally (H1: change in RA) or vertically (H2: loss of sensitivity without a change in RA). Root mean squared error (RMSE) of the model fits to perimetric sensitivity were compared. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals were bootstrapped. The dynamic range of the functional and structural RGC density estimates was denoted by their 1st and 99th percentiles.The RMSE was 2.09 (95% CI = 1.92-2.26) under H1 and 2.49 (95% CI = 2.24-2.72) under H2 (P < 0.001). The average dynamic range for the structural RGC density estimates was only 11% that of the functional estimates.Macular sensitivity loss in glaucoma is better described by a model in which RA changes with RGC loss.

Breastfeeding women were in group A and non-breastfeeding women formed the control group B. Ocular surface disease index, phenol red thread, and tear ferning tests were used in that order to assess the tear film for all the subjects. A gap of 5 minutes was allowed between phenol red thread and tear ferning tests. Data was analysed using SPSS, version 22.Of the 50 subjects, 25(50%) were in group A with mean age 30.4±5.9 years having a mean breastfeeding period of 5.4±5.0 months. The remaining 25(50%) women were in group B with mean age 28.5±2.1 years. Significant differences were found between the groups for ocular surface disease index, phenol red thread, and tear ferning (p<0.05).

2023-11-30,37556391,Temporal Analysis of Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Pancreatitis Co-Occurrence in Children and Adults in the United States.,"Pancreatitis in inflammatory bowel disease has been attributed to peripancreatic intestinal disease and/or drug-induced pancreatic toxicity. We used large cohort analyses to define inflammatory bowel disease and pancreatitis temporal co-occurrence with a detailed descriptive analysis to gain greater insight into the pathophysiological relationship between these 2 diseases.Truven Health MarketScan private insurance claims from 141,017,841 patients (younger than 65 years) and 7,457,709 patients from 4 academic hospitals were analyzed. We calculated the prevalence of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis (UC) with acute pancreatitis or chronic pancreatitis (CP) and performed temporal and descriptive analyses.Of 516,724 patients with inflammatory bowel disease, 12,109 individuals (2.3%) had pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis (AP) was 2-6x more prevalent than CP. In adults, AP occurred equally among Crohn's disease and UC (1.8%-2.2% vs 1.6%-2.1%, respectively), whereas in children, AP was more frequent in UC (2.3%-3.4% vs 1.5%-1.8%, respectively). The highest proportion of pancreatitis (21.7%-44.7%) was at/near the time of inflammatory bowel disease diagnosis. Of them, 22.1%-39.3% were on steroids during pancreatitis. Individuals with CP or recurrent pancreatitis hospitalizations had increased risk of a future inflammatory bowel disease diagnosis (odds ratio = 1.52 or 1.72, respectively).Pancreatitis in inflammatory bowel disease may not simply be a drug adverse event but may also involve local and/or systemic processes that negatively affect the pancreas. Our analysis of pancreatitis before, during, and after inflammatory bowel disease diagnosis suggests a bidirectional pathophysiologic relationship between inflammatory bowel disease and pancreatitis, with potentially more complexity than previously appreciated.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",4
2023-11-30,37572209,Statin Treatment on Cardiovascular Risk After Retinal Artery Occlusion: A Historical Cohort Study.,"Retinal artery occlusion (RAO) is a major cause of acute visual loss and patients with RAO have an increased risk for subsequent cardiovascular events. However, there is little evidence of whether the use of statins is associated with the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with RAO. We investigated whether statin treatment in patients with RAO is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events.This study was a historical cohort study with nested case-control analysis. Using the nationwide health insurance claims database in Korea, we retrospectively established a cohort of newly diagnosed RAO patients without prior cardiovascular events between January 2008 and March 2020. We defined the case group as those who had cardiovascular events (stroke or myocardial infarction) and the control group as RAO patients without primary outcome matched by sex, age, comorbidities, and duration of follow-up (1:2 incidence density sampling). Conditional logistic regression was performed.Among 13,843 patients newly diagnosed with RAO, 1030 patients had cardiovascular events (mean follow-up period of 6.4 ± 3.7 years). A total of 957 cases were matched to 1914 controls. Throughout the study period, the proportion of patients taking statin was less than half. Statin treatment after RAO was associated with a low risk of cardiovascular events (adjusted OR, 0.637; 95% CI 0.520-0.780; P < 0.001). A longer duration of statin exposure was associated with a lower cardiovascular risk.In patients with newly diagnosed RAO, treatment with statins, particularly long-term use, was associated with a low risk of future cardiovascular events.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,effectiveness,,retinal disease,4
2023-11-30,37594044,Mirikizumab-Induced Transcriptome Changes in Ulcerative Colitis Patient Biopsies at Week 12 Are Maintained Through Week 52.,"Mirikizumab, an anti-interleukin-23p19 monoclonal antibody, demonstrated efficacy in phase 2 and 3 randomized clinical trials of patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC). Previous results have shown that 12 weeks of mirikizumab treatment downregulated transcripts associated with UC disease activity and tumor necrosis factor inhibitor resistance. We assessed week-52 gene expression from week-12 responders receiving mirikizumab or placebo.In the phase 2 AMAC study (NCT02589665), mirikizumab-treated patients achieving week-12 clinical response were rerandomized to mirikizumab 200 mg subcutaneous every 4 or 12 weeks through week 52 (N = 31). Week-12 placebo responders continued placebo through week 52 (N = 7). The limma R package clustered transcript changes in colonic mucosa biopsies from baseline to week 12 into differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Among DEGs, similarly expressed genes (DEGSEGs) maintaining week-12 expression through week 52 were identified.Of 89 DEGSEGs, 63 (70.8%) were present only in mirikizumab induction responders, 5 (5.6%) in placebo responders, and 21 (23.6%) in both. Week-12 magnitudes and week-52 consistency of transcript changes were greater in mirikizumab than in placebo responders (log2FC > 1). DEGSEG clusters (from 84 DEGSEGs identified in mirikizumab and mirikizumab/placebo responders) correlated to modified Mayo score (26/84 with Pearson correlation coefficient [PCC] >0.5) and Robarts Histopathology Index (55/84 with PCC >0.5), sustained through week 52.Mirikizumab responders had broader, more sustained transcriptional changes of greater magnitudes at week 52 vs placebo. Mirikizumab responder DEGSEGs suggest a distinct molecular healing pathway associated with mirikizumab interleukin-23 inhibition.

2023-11-30,37830337,Vaccination frequency in people newly diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.,"Infections are discussed as risk factor for multiple sclerosis (MS) development and relapses. This may lead to decreased vaccination frequency in newly diagnosed patients.The aim of this study was to evaluate the relation of MS diagnosis to subsequent vaccination frequency.Based on German ambulatory claims data from 2005 to 2019, regression models were used to assess the relation of MS diagnosis (n = 12,270) to vaccination. A cohort of patients with MS was compared to control cohorts with Crohn's disease, psoriasis, and without these autoimmune diseases (total n = 198,126) in the 5 years after and before diagnosis.Patients with MS were less likely to be vaccinated compared to persons without the autoimmune diseases 5 years after diagnosis (odds ratio = 0.91, p < 0.001). Exceptions were vaccinations against influenza (1.29, p < 0.001) and pneumococci (1.41, p < 0.001). Differences were strong but less pronounced after than before diagnosis (p < 0.001). The likelihood of vaccination was also lower compared to patients with Crohn's disease or psoriasis.Patients with MS were not adequately vaccinated despite guideline recommendations.

An area-modulation test generated localized estimates of Ricco's area (RA) at 2.5° and 5° eccentricities along the 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270° meridians. Contrast thresholds were measured at the same test locations for stimuli of six durations (3.7-190.4 ms) with a Goldmann III stimulus (GIII, 0.43°) and RA-scaled stimuli. The upper limit (critical duration) of complete temporal summation (using the GIII stimulus) and spatiotemporal summation (using the RA stimuli) was estimated using iterative two-phase regression analysis.Median (interquartile range [IQR]) RA estimates were significantly larger in AMD participants (2.5°: 0.21 [0.09-0.41] deg2; 5°: 0.32 [0.15-0.65 deg2]) compared to healthy controls (2.5°: 0.08 [0.05-0.13] deg2; 5°: 0.15 [0.08-0.22] deg2) at all test locations (all P < 0.05). No significant difference in median critical duration was found in AMD participants with the GIII stimulus (19.6 [9.9-30.4] ms) and RA-scaled stimuli (22.9 [13.9-40.3] ms) compared to healthy controls (GIII: 17.0 [11.3-24.0] ms; RA-scaled: 22.4 [14.3-33.1] ms) at all test locations (all P > 0.05).Spatial summation is altered in dry AMD, without commensurate changes in temporal summation.The sensitivity of perimetry to AMD may be improved by utilizing stimuli that probe alterations in spatial summation in the disease.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinal disease,4
2023-11-30,38019499,An Evaluation of the Repeatability of Visual Function Following Surgical Repair of Macula-Off Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment.,"To evaluate the reliability and reproducibility of visual function assessments for patients with macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD).This prospective study included patients with unilateral macula-off RRD of <10-day duration successfully treated with a single, uncomplicated surgery at least 1 year following repair. Visual function assessments were performed at time of enrollment and 1 month later. Testing included Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), low-luminance visual acuity (LLVA), low-contrast visual acuity (VA) 2.5% and 5%, contrast sensitivity assessment with Mars and Gabor patches, reading speed (acuity, speed, and critical print size), color vision testing (protan, deutan, and tritan), and microperimetry. Spectral-domain ocular coherence tomography (SD-OCT) was performed. Paired t-statistics were used to compare values between visits and between the study and fellow eyes.Fourteen patients (9 male, 5 female) with a mean age of 69 years at time of surgery were evaluated. Correlation coefficients across the two visits were highest for ETDRS BCVA (0.97), tritan color vision testing (0.96), and low-contrast VA 5% (0.96), while the average t-statistic was largest for low-luminance deficit (4.2), ETDRS BCVA (4.1), and reading speed critical print size (3.7). ETDRS BCVA did not correlate with SD-OCT findings.ETDRS BCVA can be considered a highly reliable and reproducible outcome measure. LLVA, protan color discrimination, contrast sensitivity, and reading speed may be useful secondary outcome measures.This study provides guidance on the selection of visual function outcome measures for clinical trials of patients with macula-off RRD.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,effectiveness,,retinal disease,4

Slit-lamp examination showed superonasal scleral buckle exposure, purulent conjunctival discharge, corneal edema, nongranulomatous keratic precipitates, and anterior chamber cell and flare. The patient underwent urgent scleral buckle removal. Intraoperatively, an area of scleral thinning without perforation underneath the exposed buckle was discovered and covered with a scleral patch graft, and an amniotic membrane graft was used to cover an area of bare sclera with significant conjunctival scarring and retraction. Cultures grew M. abscessus panresistant except to amikacin.

Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20. Intraocular pressure changed from 28 mmHg preoperatively to 5 mmHG postoperatively in the right eye. On the first postoperative day, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/32 with intraocular pressure measured to 5 mmHg. Fundus examination revealed sectorial temporal hemorrhages with tortuous temporal superior retinal vein arcade and choroidal folds. Fluorescein angiography evidenced a slight delay in venous filling along the supratemporal arcade. Three months later, optical coherence tomography angiography showed macular capillary loops in the superotemporal area of the retina. This sectorial decompression retinopathy was evocative of a branch retinal vein occlusion. At 6 months, best-corrected visual acuity returned to 20/20, with full regression of the hemorrhages. Systemic workup was normal, but genetic assessment revealed a MTHF-R mutation.Retinal vein occlusion can be considered as a feature of ocular decompression retinopathy.

Intraoperatively, the hyphema and vitreous hemorrhage were cleared, and the source of bleeding was discovered to be an avulsed vessel through a pre-existing retinal break just superior to the optic nerve. A large submacular hemorrhage was also present that was unable to be drained through the break by aspiration alone. With the vitreous cavity under fluid, the infusion cannula was manipulated to guide the infusion stream onto the macula. The stream was directed in a distal to proximal manner toward the retinal break, and the submacular blood was successfully expressed out through the break.

These lipomas follow a benign course and rarely recur. In 3 examples, AC/DL has occurred in patients with childhood retinoblastoma (RB). We report another such example where multiple AC/DL occurred in the neck and back of a 30-year-old male who had germline RB1 gene deletion and bilateral RB in infancy. On excision, all tumors histologically showed similar morphology of adipocyte anisometry, focal single cell necrosis with surrounding binucleated or multinucleated histiocytes, hyperchromatic and minimally atypical lipocyte nuclei, vacuolated Lockhern change, rare foci of fibromyxoid change, occasional mononuclear cell clusters around capillaries, and loss of RB1 immunostaining. Unequivocal atypical cells, lipoblasts, floret-nucleated or multinucleated giant cells were absent. Molecular analysis of tumor cells showed monoallelic RB1 gene loss without amplification of MDM2 and CDK4 genes. Short-term follow up did not show tumor recurrence.

However, the pathogenesis of DR is complex, and no firm conclusions have been drawn so far. It has become a hot spot in ophthalmology research to deeply study the mechanism of DR pathological changes and find effective treatment options. Human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs) were induced by high glucose (HG) to construct DR cell model. CCK-8 assay was used to detect the viability of HRMECs. Transwell assay was used to detect the migration ability of HRMECs. Tube formation assay was used to identify the tube formation ability of HRMECs. The expressions of USP14, ATF2 and PIK3CD were detected by Western blot analysis and qRT-PCR assay. Immunoprecipitation (IP) was used to ascertain the relationship of USP14 and ATF2. To explore the regulatory relationship between ATF2 and PIK3CD by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. High glucose treatment promoted the proliferation, migration, and tube formation of HRMEC, and the expressions of USP14, ATF2 and PIK3CD were significantly up-regulated. USP14 or ATF2 knockdown inhibited HG-induced HRMECs proliferation, migration, and tube formation. USP14 regulated the expression of ATF2, and ATF2 promoted PIK3CD expression. PIK3CD overexpression attenuated the inhibitory effectiveness of USP14 knockdown on proliferation, migration and tube formation of DR cell model.

This study aimed to comprehensively assess luteolin's therapeutic efficacy in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model, shedding light on its anti-UC mechanisms.Our investigation encompassed in vivo assessments of luteolin's therapeutic potential against DSS-induced colitis through rigorous histopathological examination and biochemical analyses. Furthermore, we scrutinized luteolin's anti-inflammatory prowess in vitro using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells and primary peritoneal macrophages. Additionally, we quantitatively evaluated the impact of luteolin on C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2)-induced macrophage migration employing Transwell and Zigmond chambers. Furthermore, cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) assay, and molecular docking were employed to identify potential therapeutic targets of luteolin and investigate their binding sites and interaction patterns.Luteolin demonstrated therapeutic potential against DSS-induced colitis by ameliorating colitis symptoms, restoring intestinal barrier integrity, and inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine production in the colonic tissues. Moreover, luteolin demonstrated robust anti-inflammatory activity in vitro, in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells and primary peritoneal macrophages. Notably, luteolin suppressed the phosphorylation of IKKα/β, IκBα, and p65, along with preventing IκBα degradation in LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages. Furthermore, luteolin impaired the migratory behavior of RAW264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages, as evidenced by reduced migration distance and velocity of luteolin-treated macrophages. Mechanistically, luteolin was found to antagonize IKKα/β, subsequently inhibiting IKKα/β phosphorylation and the activation of NF-κB signaling.Luteolin emerges as a promising lead compound for the clinical therapy of colitis by virtue of its ability to ameliorate DSS-induced colitis, antagonize IKKα/β, suppress NF-κB signaling, and impede macrophage activation and migration.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3

In this study, the anti-UC activity of EYPC was investigated using a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis model of BALB/c mice. The results showed that EYPC supplementation inhibited DSS-induced colon shortening, the spleen index and disease activity index increase and intestinal structural damage. EYPC could down-regulate the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and MPO in the colon and restore the number of goblet cells and the level of tight junction (TJ) proteins. Besides, EYPC modulated the composition of the gut microbiota, lowered the relative abundance of the pathogenic bacterium Parabacteroides and upregulated the abundance of the beneficial bacteria Alistipes and Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group. These results evidenced that EYPC could attenuate DSS-induced colitis in mice and had the potential to prevent and treat UC.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3

New biologics have been evolving over the past 20 years and selection of an agent remains challenging.Drug persistence measures the duration of time from initiation to discontinuation of a therapy, which can be a surrogate marker of drug tolerance and efficacy.The study aimed to compare drug persistence of new generation biologics for the treatment of UC and CD (vedolizumab, ustekinumab, certolizumab, tofacitinib, natalizumab and golimumab) with conventional anti-tumor necroisis factor alphas (anti-TNF alphas) (adalimumab and infliximab) in adult patients with IBD. Results of the study may provide guidance on the preferred first and subsequent lines of biological treatments in patients with IBD.Search via electronic databases including EMBASE, MEDLINE, PubMed and clinical trial databases will be conducted on 10 March 2023 with eligible studies included from inception of 2017 to 2023. The primary outcomes are 1-year persistence of individual biologics with comparison of new biologics versus conventional anti-TNF alphas. A meta-analysis will be conducted using Review Manager V.5 and outcome will be presented as relative risk. Heterogeneity will be assessed with forest plot, χ2 and I2, followed with sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis.

This work aimed to establish and evaluate a dedicated ultrasound education program for learning POCOUS-specific skills during medical studies at a university hospital.The blended learning-based program (6 teaching units) based on recent scientific publications and recommendations was developed for students in the clinical part of their medical studies. Experts and trainers consisted of physicians from the Ear-Nose-Throat, radiology, ophthalmology and neurology specialties as well as university educational specialists. Lecture notes containing digital video links for preparation was produced as teaching material. In total, 33 students participated in the study. The education program, including the teaching materials, motivation and subjective gain in competency, was evaluated with the aid of a questionnaire (7-point Likert response format). Objective learning success was assessed on the basis of pre- and post-tests. These covered the skill areas: ""anatomical basics"", ""ultrasound basics"", ""understanding of cross-sectional images"", ""normal findings"" and ""pathology recognition"".In the objective assessment of image interpretation, the participants improved significantly (p < 0.001) from pre- to post-test with a large effect size (Cohen's d = 1.78, effect size r = 0.66). The evaluations revealed a high level of satisfaction with the course concept, teaching materials and the tutors. In addition, a high level of motivation was recorded in relation to continuing to study ""ultrasound diagnostics"" and ""ophthalmologic diseases"". A significant (p < 0.01) positive gain was also achieved in terms of the subjective assessment of competency. This covers areas such as expertise, sonographic anatomy and performing a POCOUS examination as well as recognizing retinal detachment, globe perforation and increased optic nerve sheath diameter.The results of this feasibility study show that medical students accept and support a POCOUS-specific education program and are able to develop a higher objective and subjective level of competency.

2023-11-01,37792226,TRIM9 promotes Müller cell-derived retinal stem cells to differentiate into retinal ganglion cells by regulating Atoh7.,"Glaucoma is a multifactorial, irreversible blinding eye disease characterized by a large number of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) deaths. Müller cell-derived retinal stem cells (RSCs) can be induced to differentiate into RGCs under certain conditions. This study aimed to explore the regulatory effect and mechanism of TRIM9 on the differentiation of Müller cell-derived stem cells into RGCs. First, episcleral vein cauterization was used to induce high intraocular pressure (IOP) rat model. Next, Müller cells were isolated from rat retina, identified and induced to dedifferentiate into RSCs. Finally, RSCs were intervened with lentivirus PGC-FU-TRIM9-GFP transfection or siRNA Atoh7 and induced to redifferentiate into RGCs. In vivo, TRIM9 was highly expressed and Müller cells proliferated abnormally in the high IOP rat model. In vitro, S-100, GFAP, vimentin, and GS were positively expressed in Müller cells isolated from rat retina, and the purity of cells was 97.17%. Under the stimulation of cytokines, the proliferative capacity of the cells and the expression of Nestin and Ki67 gradually increased with the prolongation of culture time. Furthermore, RSCs transfected with the lentiviral vector PGC-FU-TRIM9-GFP displayed a striking morphological feature of long neurites. Additionally, there was a remarkable increase in the fluorescence intensity of Brn-3b and Thy1.1, accompanied by elevated mRNA and protein expression levels of Brn-3b, Thy1.1, and Atoh7. After knocking down Atoh7, the effect of TRIM9 on the above indicators was reversed.

Historical approaches with corticosteroids and immunomodulators are far less effective than early treatment with anti-TNF biologics.This review covers recent literature delineating the crucial role of early anti-TNF therapy in the treatment of moderate- to- severe Crohn's disease in children and adolescents. The potential risks and benefits of concomitant immunomodulators are discussed, along with therapeutic anti-TNF drug monitoring, and reassessment by endoscopy and cross-sectional imaging to evaluate success beyond symptom control.Standard of care therapy for moderate-to-severe pediatric Crohn's disease now entails precision dosing of anti-TNF therapy with periodic reassessment of bowel inflammation. The role of dietary modification continues to evolve. Current and future efforts need to be directed to elucidating ways to predict response to anti-TNF therapy and quickly changing to agents with other mechanisms of action when needed.

Local ophthalmology noted bilateral optic disc swelling and referred him urgently for neurological investigations.Clinical Findings: At presentation VA was RE 0.00 and LE 0.2 with normal Ishihara colour vision. His extraocular movements were full without manifest strabismus. Fundoscopy showed bilateral optic disc swelling. Electrophysiology unexpectedly revealed a functionally cone isolated retina with markedly abnormal rod function. Pattern VEPs indicated bilateral macular pathway dysfunction affecting left eye more than right eye. Wide field imaging showed bilateral diffusely scattered yellow-white flecks in the midperiphery of each eye. His kinetic visual fields were moderately restricted bilaterally. MRI showed a Chiari 1 malformation with cerebellar tonsil herniation, but LP opening pressure was normal.Differential diagnosis included RDH5 retinopathy or vitamin A deficiency. On questioning he reported a diet restricted to only meat and biscuits. His vitamin A levels were subnormal at 0.14 umol/L (reference range 0.9-2.5umol/l) and he was started on high-dose Vitamin A supplements.Four months after supplementation retinal appearances had normalised, the rod ERGs recovered, nyctalopia and visual field restriction resolved. PVEPs had improved but an element of LE macular pathway dysfunction remained. Optic disc swelling settled leaving mild temporal pallor, particularly of the LE with some RNFL loss.It is important to recognise nutritional Vitamin A deficiency in children as prompt recognition and treatment can improve symptoms, reverse retinal pathology which we have demonstrated with electrophysiological findings.",no,yes,no,other,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,retinopathy,3
2023-11-01,37801159,[Role of vitreous in the pathogenesis of neovascular age-related macular degeneration].,"Age-related changes in vitreous molecular and anatomic morphology begin early in life and involve two major processes: vitreous liquefaction and weakening of vitreo-retinal adhesion. An imbalance in these two processes results in anomalous posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), which comprises, among other conditions, vitreo-macular adhesion (VMA) and traction (VMT). VMA is more common in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) than age-matched control patients, with the site of posterior vitreous adherence to the inner retina correlating with location of neovascular complexes. The pernicious effects of an attached posterior vitreous on age-related macular degeneration (AMD) progression involve mechanical forces, enhanced fluid influx and inflammation in and between the retinal layers, hypoxia leading to an accumulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other stimulatory cytokines, and probably an infiltration of hyalocytes. It has been shown that vitrectomy not only mitigates progression to end-stage AMD, but existing choroidal neovascularization regresses after surgery. Thus, surgical PVD induction during vitrectomy or by pharmacologic vitreolysis may be considered in non-responders to anti-VEGF treatment with concomitant VMA.",no,yes,no,other,"effectiveness, safety",,retinal disease,3
2023-11-01,37803644,CPW partially attenuates DSS-induced ulcerative colitis in mice.,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) of the gastrointestinal tract. The etiology is not fully understood, but environmental, microbial, and immunologic factors, as well as a genetic predisposition, play a role. UC is characterized by episodes of abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stools, weight loss, severe colonic inflammation, and ulceration. Despite the increase in the frequency of UC and the deterioration of the quality of life, there are still patients who do not respond well to available treatment options. Against this background, natural products such as polysaccharides are becoming increasingly important as they protect the intestinal mucosa, promote wound healing, relieve inflammation and pain, and restore intestinal motility. In this study, we investigated the effect of a polysaccharide isolated from the biomass of Campomanesia adamantium and Campomanesia pubescens (here referred to as CPW) in an experimental model of acute and chronic ulcerative colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). CPW reversed weight loss, increased disease activity index (DAI), bloody diarrhea, and colon shortening. In addition, CPW reduced visceral mechanical hypersensitivity, controlled oxidative stress and inflammation, and protected the mucosal barrier. CPW is not absorbed in the intestine, does not inhibit cytochrome P450 proteins, and does not exhibit AMES toxicity. These results suggest that CPW attenuates DSS-induced acute and chronic colitis in mice and may be a potential alternative treatment for UC.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety",,ulcerative colitis,3

In this review, we investigated NMAs comparing aflibercept with ranibizumab for diabetic macular oedema (DME) in the hope of illuminating why the differences in findings occurred.Studies were searched for in English and Chinese electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, VIP; see detailed search strategy in the main body). Two independent reviewers systematically screened to identify target NMAs that included a comparison of aflibercept and ranibizumab in patients with DME. The key outcome of interest in this review is the change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), including various ways of reporting (such as the proportion of participants who gain ≥ 10 ETDRS letters at 12 months; average change in BCVA at 12 months).For the binary outcome of BCVA, different NMAs all agreed that there is no clear difference between the two treatments, while continuous outcomes all favour aflibercept over ranibizumab. We discussed four points of particular concern that are illustrated by five similar NMAs, including network differences, PICO (participants, interventions, comparators, outcomes) differences, different data from the same measures of effect, and differences in what is truly significant.A closer inspection of each of these trials shows how the methods, including the searches and analyses, all differ, but the findings, although presented differently and sometimes interpreted differently, were similar.",no,yes,yes,other,effectiveness,,retinopathy,3

Our study aimed to explore the effect of marein on HG-induced HRMEC injury and the mechanism underlying this purported therapeutic effect.HRMEC was divided into normal glucose group, high glucose (HG) group, HG+marein low, medium and high (L, M, H) concentrations group, HG+pcDNA group, HG+pcDNA-small nucleolar RNA host gene 7 (SNHG7) group, HG+marein+si-negative control (NC) group, and HG+marein+si-SNHG7 group. Flow cytometry and Western blotting were performed to determine apoptosis rate and apoptosis-related protein levels. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were detected to assess cellular oxidative stress. SNHG7 expression was examined using real-time quantitative PCR.After treatment with low, medium and high concentrations of marein, apoptosis rate, Bax level, LDH level and MDA content were decreased, while B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) level, SOD activity, and SNHG7 expression were promoted in HG-induced HRMEC injury in a concentration-dependent manner (p < 0.05). After overexpression of SNHG7, apoptosis rate, Bax level, LDH level and MDA content were decreased, while Bcl-2 level and SOD activity were enhanced in HG-induced HRMEC injury (p < 0.05). In contrast, SNHG7 knockdown reversed the effect of marein on HG-induced HRMEC injury.Marein could alleviate HG-induced HRMEC injury by up-regulating SNHG7 expression.",no,yes,no,in vitro,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinopathy,3

However, long-term outcomes of m-CNV management have been unsatisfactory, leading to high recurrence rates. These studies aim to identify risk factors for m-CNV recurrence.Comprehensive review followed a pre-registered plan in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO). The search strategy used various databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Scopus and ScienceDirect using the keywords 'Myopic Choroidal Neovascularization', 'Recurrence' and 'Risk'. Eligible studies were identified and analysed based on predetermined criteria. This study was registered on PROSPERO (CRD4202343461).The systematic review included three retrospective studies investigating risk factors associated with m-CNV recurrence. These factors are: (1) requiring three or more injections for initial disease control, (2) older age, (3) larger myopic macular neovascularisation, (4) juxtafoveal CNV, (5) larger height of hyper-reflective foci (HRF) and (6) destruction or absence of the ellipsoid zone (EZ) and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE).Risk factors for m-CNV recurrence include a greater number of required injections, older age, large macular CNV, juxtafoveal location, increased HRF height and changes in EZ and RPE structure. Understanding these factors can inform personalised treatment approaches and improve patient outcomes by identifying individuals at higher risk of recurrence and implementing proactive measures to mitigate the impact of m-CNV recurrence and progression. Further investigation is needed to enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms and develop innovative therapeutic approaches for effective m-CNV management.CRD4202343461.",no,yes,yes,other,effectiveness,,retinal disease,3

Inspired by clinical medication in traditional Chinese medicine, we used berberine hydrochloride (BBH) and dehydrocostus lactone (DEH) in combination for the first time and focused on studying their mechanism of treating UC based on gut microbiota. Therefore, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of BBH and DEH on DSS-induced UC mice using ELISA, HE and AB-PAS staining, 16s rDNA amplicon sequencing technology, and fecal transplantation experiments (FMT). In this study, the combination of BBH and DEH significantly relieved symptoms, colonic inflammation, and intestinal barrier damage of DSS-induced UC mice, and they did not show antagonism. In addition, the co-administration of BBH and DEH altered the composition and function of gut microbiota, with BBH increasing the abundance of key beneficial bacterial genus Akkermansia and DEH aiming to enhance species diversity and supplying intestinal proteins to prevent overconsumption. Furthermore, our data showed that BBH and DEH improve the levels of short-chain fatty acids, which also proved the positive regulation of gut microbiota by BBH and DEH. Finally, the FMT confirmed the strong correlation between BBH, DEH, and the gut microbiota. In conclusion, the co-administration of BBH and DEH protected the intestinal barrier and reduced inflammatory damage by regulating gut microbiota, targeting the key beneficial bacterial genus Akkermansia, and maintaining a normal supply of intestinal proteins.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3

Ongoing retinal development after birth has also been demonstrated in the developing albino eye offering a potential therapeutic window in humans. To study whether human equivalent doses of L-DOPA/Carbidopa administered during the crucial postnatal period of neuroplasticity can rescue visual function, OCA C57BL/6 J-c2J OCA1 mice were treated with a 28-day course of oral L-DOPA/Carbidopa at 3 different doses from 15 to 43 days postnatal age (PNA) and for 3 different lengths of treatment, to identify optimum dosage and treatment length. Visual electrophysiology, acuity, and retinal morphology were measured at 4, 5, 6, 12 and 16 weeks PNA and compared to untreated C57BL/6 J (WT) and OCA1 mice. Quantification of PEDF, βIII-tubulin and syntaxin-3 expression was also performed. Our data showed impaired retinal morphology, decreased retinal function and lower visual acuity in untreated OCA1 mice compared to WT mice. These changes were diminished or eliminated when treated with higher doses of L-DOPA/Carbidopa. Our results demonstrate that oral L-DOPA/Carbidopa supplementation at human equivalent doses during the postnatal critical period of retinal neuroplasticity can rescue visual retinal morphology and retinal function, via PEDF upregulation and modulation of retinal synaptogenesis, providing a further step towards developing an effective treatment for albinism patients.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,"retinopathy, retinal disease",3

Angiogenesis has been proven its role in RB metastasis due to the presence of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in RB cells. Therefore, exploring angiogenic pathway by inhibiting VEGF in treating RB would pave the way for future treatment. In preclinical studies, anti-VEGF molecule have shown their efficacy in treating RB. However, treatment requires recurrent intra-vitreal injections causing various side effects along with patient nonadherence. As a result, delivery of anti-VEGF agent to retina requires an ocular delivery system that can transport it in a non-invasive manner to achieve patient compliance. Moreover, development of these type of systems are challenging due to the complicated physiological barriers of eye. Adopting a non-invasive or minimally invasive approach for delivery of anti-VEGF agents would not only address the bioavailability issues but also improve patient adherence to therapy overcoming the side effects associated with invasive approach.

A growing body of evidence indicates an accumulation of senescent neurons and blood vessels in response to stress and aging in the retina. Prolonged accumulation of senescent cells and long-term activation of stress signaling responses may lead to multiple chronic diseases, tissue dysfunction, and age-related pathologies by exposing neighboring cells to the heightened pathological senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). However, the ultimate impacts of cellular senescence on the retinal vasculopathies and retinal vascular development remain ill-defined. In this review, we first summarize the molecular players and fundamental mechanisms driving cellular senescence, as well as the beneficial implications of senescent cells in driving vital physiological processes such as embryogenesis, wound healing, and tissue regeneration. Then, the dual implications of senescent cells on the growth, hemostasis, and remodeling of retinal blood vessels are described to document how senescent cells contribute to both retinal vascular development and the severity of proliferative retinopathies.

2023-11-01,37833663,Folate and retinal vascular diseases.,"Folate, a pteroylglutamic acid derivative, participates in fundamental cellular metabolism. Homocysteine, an amino acid, serves as an intermediate of the methionine cycle and can be converted back to methionine. Hyperhomocysteinemia is a recognized risk factor for atherosclerotic and cardiovascular diseases. In recent decades, elevated plasma homocysteine levels and low folate status have been observed in many patients with retinal vascular diseases, such as retinal vascular occlusions, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related degeneration. Homocysteine-induced toxicity toward vascular endothelial cells might participate in the formation of retinal vascular diseases. Folate is an important dietary determinant of homocysteine. Folate deficiency is the most common cause of hyperhomocysteinemia. Folate supplementation can eliminate excess homocysteine in plasma. In in vitro experiments, folic acid had a protective effect on vascular endothelial cells against high glucose. Many studies have explored the relationship between folate and various retinal vascular diseases. This review summarizes the most important findings that lead to the conclusion that folic acid supplementation might be a protective treatment in patients with retinal vascular diseases with high homocysteine or glucose status.

Here, we show for the first time that B. uniformis F18-22, an alginate-fermenting bacterium isolated from the healthy human colon, protects against dextran-sulfate-sodium (DSS)-induced UC in mice. Specifically, oral intake of B. uniformis F18-22 alleviated colon contraction, improved intestinal bleeding and attenuated mucosal damage in diseased mice. Additionally, B. uniformis F18-22 improved gut dysbiosis in UC mice by increasing the abundance of anti-inflammatory acetate-producing bacterium Eubacterium siraeum and decreasing the amount of pro-inflammatory pathogenetic bacteria Escherichia-Shigella spp. Moreover, B. uniformis F18-22 was well-tolerated in mice and showed no oral toxicity after repeated daily administration for 28 consecutive days.

Results showed that Polycan 250, Polycan 500, and 5-ASA significantly inhibited body weight loss compared with DSS. Similar to 5-ASA, Polycan 500 exhibited preventive effects on colon length shortening and histological changes in colon tissues. Polycan inhibited the DSS-induced decrease in fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran permeability and myeloperoxidase activity. Moreover, Polycan significantly recovered serum cytokine (e.g., tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1β) or mRNA expression in colon tissue compared with DSS. Polycan also inhibited apoptosis by reducing caspase-3 activity and the Bcl-2 associated X/B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) ratio.

However, ECP is not easily absorbed in the gut and, as a potential candidate for next-generation prebiotics development, how it is fermented by human gut microbiota has not been characterized. Here, using in vitro anaerobic fermentation and 16S high-throughput sequencing, we illustrate for the first time the detailed fermentation characteristics of ECP by the gut microbiota of nine UC patients. Our results indicated that, compared to that of glucose, fermentation of ECP by human gut microbiota produced a higher amount of anti-inflammatory acetate and a lower amount of pro-inflammatory lactate. Additionally, ECP fermentation helped to shape a more balanced microbiota composition with increased species richness and diversity. Moreover, ECP significantly stimulated the growth of anti-colitis bacteria in the human gut, including Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus, Blautia spp., Bacteroides uniformis, and Parabacteroides spp. Altogether, our study provides the first evidence for the prebiotic effect of ECP on human gut microbiota and sheds new light on the development of ECP as a novel prebiotic candidate for the prevention and potential treatment of UC.",no,yes,no,in vitro,"effectiveness, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3
2023-11-01,37862382,The murine retinal pigment epithelium requires peroxisomal β-oxidation to maintain lysosomal function and prevent dedifferentiation.,"Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells have to phagocytose shed photoreceptor outer segments (POS) on a daily basis over the lifetime of an organism, but the mechanisms involved in the digestion and recycling of POS lipids are poorly understood. Although it was frequently assumed that peroxisomes may play an essential role, this was never investigated. Here, we show that global as well as RPE-selective loss of peroxisomal β-oxidation in multifunctional protein 2 (MFP2) knockout mice impairs the digestive function of lysosomes in the RPE at a very early age, followed by RPE degeneration. This was accompanied by prolonged mammalian target of rapamycin activation, lipid deregulation, and mitochondrial structural anomalies without, however, causing oxidative stress or energy shortage. The RPE degeneration caused secondary photoreceptor death. Notably, the deterioration of the RPE did not occur in an Mfp2/rd1 mutant mouse line, characterized by absent POS shedding. Our findings prove that peroxisomal β-oxidation in the RPE is essential for handling the polyunsaturated fatty acids present in ingested POS and shed light on retinopathy in patients with peroxisomal disorders. Our data also have implications for gene therapy development as they highlight the importance of targeting the RPE in addition to the photoreceptor cells.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,"retinopathy, retinal disease",3

Malignancies of breast, colon, head and neck, kidney, prostate, thyroid, and non-melanoma skin cancer have been reported among patients who received ustekinumab. We report the case of a 42-year-old Crohn's patient on long-term treatment with ustekinumab, who developed achromatic malignant melanoma. Crohn's was diagnosed at the age of 15, with upper and lower gastrointestinal involvement and was initially treated with azathioprine (2mg/kg for 4 years) and infliximab (5mg/kg for 6 weeks). Due to ileal obstruction, the patient underwent stricturoplasty and received adalimumab (40mg every other week) for two years. He then discontinued therapy and a year later underwent right hemicolectomy. Adalimumab was reinstituted (40mg every other week) and the patient remained in clinical remission for two years. His overall exposure to adalimumab was four years. Ustekinumab was initiated due to a relapse and after 3 years, an incident of scalp itching led to the diagnosis metastatic achromatic malignant melanoma bearing BRAF V600E mutation. He received targeted therapy with an initial good response.

Here, we examined the mechanisms that underlie macrophage-driven retinal cell death. Monocytes were extracted from patients with AMD and differentiated into macrophages (hMdɸs), which were characterized based on proteomics, gene expression, and ex vivo and in vivo properties. Using bioinformatics, we identified the signaling pathway involved in macrophage-driven retinal cell death, and we assessed the therapeutic potential of targeting this pathway. We found that M2a hMdɸs were associated with retinal cell death in retinal explants and following adoptive transfer in a photic injury model. Moreover, M2a hMdɸs express several CCRI (C-C chemokine receptor type 1) ligands. Importantly, CCR1 was upregulated in Müller cells in models of retinal injury and aging, and CCR1 expression was correlated with retinal damage. Lastly, inhibiting CCR1 reduced photic-induced retinal damage, photoreceptor cell apoptosis, and retinal inflammation. These data suggest that hMdɸs, CCR1, and Müller cells work together to drive retinal and macular degeneration, suggesting that CCR1 may serve as a target for treating these sight-threatening conditions.",no,yes,no,other,"effectiveness, biomarker",,"retinopathy, retinal disease",3

The reduction in ELP1 mRNA and protein leads to the death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and visual impairment in all FD patients. Currently patient symptoms are managed, but there is no treatment for the disease. We sought to test the hypothesis that restoring levels of Elp1 would thwart the death of RGCs in FD. To this end, we tested the effectiveness of two therapeutic strategies for rescuing RGCs. Here we provide proof-of-concept data that gene replacement therapy and small molecule splicing modifiers effectively reduce the death of RGCs in mouse models for FD and provide pre-clinical foundational data for translation to FD patients.",no,yes,no,animal,effectiveness,,retinal disease,3

In spite of recent therapeutic breakthroughs, it is not yet possible to cure DR through pharmacotherapy. Cell death is thought to play a key role in the pathogenesis of DR. Moderate modulation of cellular autophagy and inhibition of apoptosis have been identified as effective targets for the treatment of DR. Numerous phytochemicals have emerged as potential new drugs for the treatment of DR. We collected basic DR research on herbal monomers through keywords such as autophagy and apoptosis, and conducted a systematic search for relevant research articles published in the PubMed database. This review provides the effects and reports of herbal monomers on various DR cellular and animal models in vivo and in vitro in the available literature, and emphasizes the importance of cellular autophagy and apoptosis as current DR therapeutic targets. Based on our review, we believe that herbal monomers that modulate autophagy and inhibit apoptosis may be potentially effective candidates for the development of new drugs in the treatment of DR.

2023-11-01,37904683,Mechanistic insights into the role of probiotics in modulating immune cells in ulcerative colitis.,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a persistent inflammatory disorder that affects the gastrointestinal tract, mainly the colon, which is defined by inflammatory responses and the formation of ulcers. Probiotics have been shown to directly impact various immune cells, including dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and T and B cells. By interacting with cell surface receptors, they regulate immune cell activity, produce metabolites that influence immune responses, and control the release of cytokines and chemokines.This article is a comprehensive review wherein we conducted an exhaustive search across published literature, utilizing reputable databases like PubMed and Web of Science. Our focus centered on pertinent keywords, such as ""UC,"" 'DSS,"" ""TNBS,"" ""immune cells,"" and ""inflammatory cytokines,"" to compile the most current insights regarding the therapeutic potential of probiotics in managing UC.This overview aims to provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of the effects of probiotics on immune cells in relation to UC. Probiotics have a crucial role in promoting the proliferation of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are necessary for preserving immunological homeostasis and regulating inflammatory responses. They also decrease the activation of pro-inflammatory cells like T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cells, contributing to UC development. Thus, probiotics significantly impact both direct and indirect pathways of immune cell regulation in UC, promoting Treg differentiation, inhibiting pro-inflammatory cell activation, and regulating cytokine and chemokine release.Probiotics demonstrate significant potential in modulating the immune reactions in UC. Their capacity to modulate different immune cells and inflammation-related processes makes them a promising therapeutic approach for managing UC. However, further studies are warranted to optimize their use and fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying their beneficial effects in UC treatment.",no,yes,yes,other,"effectiveness, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3
2023-11-01,37906058,Silibinin Prevents TGFβ-Induced EMT of RPE in Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy by Inhibiting Stat3 and Smad3 Phosphorylation.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of silibinin on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) and proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) formation, as well as its underlying molecular mechanism.Cellular morphological change and EMT molecular markers were evaluated by using phase contrast imaging, qPCR, and Western blot (WB) to investigate the impact of silibinin on the EMT of ARPE-19 cells. Scratch assay and transwell assay were used to study the effect of silibinin on cell migration. An intravitreally injected RPE-induced rat PVR model was used to assess the effect of silibinin on PVR in vivo. RNA-seq was applied to study the molecular mechanism of silibinin-mediated PVR prevention.Silibinin inhibited TGFβ1-induced EMT and migration of RPE in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. Moreover, silibinin prevented proliferative membrane formation in an intravitreal injected RPE-induced rat PVR model. In line with these findings, RNA-seq revealed a global suppression of TGFβ1-induced EMT and migration-related genes by silibinin in RPEs. Mechanistically, silibinin reduced TGFβ1-induced phosphorylation levels of Smad3 and Stat3, and Smad3 nuclear translocation in RPE.Silibinin inhibits the EMT of RPE cells in vitro and prevents the formation of PVR membranes in vivo. Mechanistically, silibinin inhibits Smad3 phosphorylation and suppresses Smad3 nuclear translocation through the inhibition of Stat3 phosphorylation.

Ultra-widefield fundus photography, macular spectral domain optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography angiography were performed.A 36-year-old woman went to the emergency department with sudden, painless, left eye vision loss. The only relevant medical history was COVID-19 9 weeks before. The best-corrected visual acuity was 20/200, a left eye relative afferent pupillary defect was present, and superficial hemorrhages throughout the macular area and peripheral retina were found. Nearly 4 hours after admission, the left eye best-corrected visual acuity recovered to 20/20 without relative afferent pupillary defect. Five days after presentation in the emergency department, the patient returned with recurrent left eye vision loss, with spontaneous recovery within 12 hours. Macular spectral domain optical coherence tomography revealed hyperreflectivity of the inner plexiform and inner nuclear layers, and the diagnosis of paracentral acute middle maculopathy was established. The patient started oral acetylsalicylic acid and oral prednisolone. The patient did not report any new episodes of vision loss, and there was a progressive resolution of abnormal fundus findings.SARS-CoV-2 infection increases the risk of vascular thrombotic events with possible involvement of the retinal circulation, and paracentral acute middle maculopathy may present as a possible complication.

The next day, the patient underwent a combined vitrectomy and phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation. During vitrectomy, a retinochoroidectomy was performed at the exit wound and the internal limiting membrane was peeled over the macula and up to the exit wound. Laser retinopexy was followed by plugging of a piece of the amniotic membrane to the exit wound. A second piece of the amniotic membrane was used to cover the bare retinochoroidectomy area. The surgery was concluded with a silicone exchange. Postoperatively, no sign of proliferative vitreoretinopathy was observed, and at 3 months, the silicone oil was removed. The follow-up was uneventful, and the eye achieved a final visual acuity of 20/30.The amniotic membrane may offer a simple and safe solution for the repair of the exit wounds of perforating injuries involving the retina and the choroid.

2023-11-02,36650089,Application of Artificial Intelligence in Precision Medicine for Diabetic Macular Edema.,"Diabetic macular edema (DME) is the primary cause of central vision impairment in patients with diabetes and the leading cause of preventable blindness in working-age people. With the advent of optical coherence tomography and antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy, the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of DME were greatly revolutionized in the last decade. However, there is tremendous heterogeneity among DME patients, and 30%-50% of DME patients do not respond well to anti-VEGF agents. In addition, there is no evidence-based and universally accepted administration regimen. The identification of DME patients not responding to anti-VEGF agents and the determination of the optimal administration interval are the 2 major challenges of DME, which are difficult to achieve with the coarse granularity of conventional health care modality. Therefore, more and more retina specialists have pointed out the necessity of introducing precision medicine into the management of DME and have conducted related studies in recent years. One of the most frontier methods is the targeted extraction of individualized disease features from optical coherence tomography images based on artificial intelligence technology, which provides precise evaluation and risk classification of DME. This review aims to provide an overview of the progress of artificial intelligence-enabled precision medicine in automated screening, precise evaluation, prognosis prediction, and follow-up monitoring of DME.

Genetic studies indicated that mutations in EMC1 gene were associated with retinal degeneration diseases; however, the role of EMC1 in photoreceptor has not been confirmed. Here, we show that Emc1 ablation in the photoreceptor cells of mice recapitulated the retinitis pigmentosa phenotypes, including an attenuated scotopic electroretinogram response and the progressive degeneration of rod cells and cone cells. Histopathological examination of tissues from rod-specific Emc1 knockout mice revealed mislocalized rhodopsin and irregularly arranged cone cells at the age of 2 months. Further immunoblotting analysis revealed decreased levels of membrane proteins and endoplasmic reticulum chaperones in 1-month-old rod-specific Emc1 knockout mice retinae, and this led us to speculate that the loss of membrane proteins is the main cause of the degeneration of photoreceptors. EMC1 most likely regulated the membrane protein levels at an earlier step in the biosynthetic process before the proteins translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum. The present study demonstrates the essential roles of Emc1 in photoreceptor cells, and reveals the mechanism through which EMC1 mutations are linked to retinitis pigmentosa.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinal disease,3

Late-onset hyponatremia typically occurs in infants who are physiologically stable and is defined as serum sodium of 132 mEq/L or less or between 133 and 135 mEq/L if receiving sodium supplementation. Recent evidence suggests that spot urine sodium levels may improve the recognition of LOH, as low levels of excreted urine reflect a total body sodium deficit and negative balance. Untreated LOH may result in poor somatic growth, neurodevelopmental delay, higher incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and more severe retinopathy of prematurity. The primary prevention of LOH is to maintain serum sodium between 135 and 145 mEq/L; however, there are currently no formal protocols guiding sodium supplementation. The purpose of this article is to present on overview of LOH pathophysiology and its effect on somatic growth, neurodevelopment outcomes, and other related sequelae.

The development of ultra-wide-field imaging combined with fluorescein angiography has allowed improved visualization of the peripheral retinal vasculature. Patient cooperation in the pediatric population is particularly challenging, but hand-held digital retinal photography has shown promise and can visualize the infant retina without the need for anesthesia and intravenous access. Many features of retinopathy of prematurity and its response to laser and anti-VEGF treatment can be either exclusively or better visualized on fluorescein angiography compared to indirect ophthalmoscopy or color fundus photography. Disease treatment is gradually shifting from laser photocoagulation to intravitreal anti-VEGF agents, the latter being associated with late-onset vision-threatening sequelae. The role of fluorescein angiography in retinopathy of prematurity monitoring will continue to increase with the longer follow-up required and different clinical behavior seen with anti-VEGF treatment.

This study assessed the adverse events (AEs) associated with upadacitinib by mining data from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).Disproportionality analyses, including the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), and the multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS) algorithms, were employed to quantify the signals of upadacitinib-associated AEs.A total of 3,837,420 reports of AEs were collected from the FAERS database, of which 4494 reports were identified with upadacitinib as the ""primary suspect (PS)"". Upadacitinib-induced AEs occurrence targeted 27 system organ clases (SOCs). A total of 200 significant disproportionality PTs conforming to the four algorithms were simultaneously retained. Unexpected significant AEs, such as arthralgia, musculoskeletal stiffness, diverticulitis, and cataract might also occur. The median onset time of upadacitinib-associated AEs was 65 days (interquartile range [IQR] 21-182 days), and most of the onsets occurred within the first 1, 2, 3, and 4 months after initiation of upadacitinib.This study found potential new AEs signals and might provide important support for clinical monitoring and risk identification of upadacitinib.",no,yes,no,other,safety,,ulcerative colitis,3

We evaluate emerging evidence for IFX SC treatment for difficult-to-treat IBD, use as monotherapy, and suitability for patients receiving escalated IFX IV doses. Therapeutic drug monitoring approaches and patient and healthcare system perspectives on IFX SC are also discussed.IFX SC represents a significant treatment innovation in the tumor necrosis factor inhibitor class after approximately 20 years of IFX IV availability. Evidence suggests that IFX SC is well tolerated and is associated with high patient acceptance and satisfaction. In addition, effectiveness is maintained in patients with stable disease following switch from IFX IV. Switching may be advisable, given the clinical benefits of IFX SC and its potential to improve healthcare service capacity. There are several areas requiring further research, including the role of IFX SC in difficult-to-treat and refractory disease, and the feasibility of IFX SC monotherapy.",no,yes,no,other,"effectiveness, safety",,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",3

Although the exact etiology of this chronic intestinal disease is not fully understood, nutritional factors appear to play key roles. Furthermore, individuals with IBD are at increased risk of adverse nutritional impacts, including micronutrient deficiencies.This review aims to summarize recent reports focusing on nutritional factors relevant to the development of IBD and to also review data on nutritional deficiencies seen in individuals with IBD.The typical western diet, characterized by high-fat/high-sugar foods, along with food additives, appears to contribute to the etiopathogenesis of IBD. In contrast, some reports indicate that some foods are likely protective. However, there are inconsistencies in the currently available data, reflecting study design and other confounding factors. Furthermore, some of the conclusions are inferred from animal or in vitro studies. The presence of IBD can compromise the nutrition of individuals with one of these disorders: ongoing monitoring is critical.

2023-11-02,37387532,Time to incorporate preemptive NUDT15 testing before starting thiopurines in inflammatory bowel disease in Asia and beyond: a review.,"Thiopurine toxicity is related to genetic polymorphism. Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) variants do not explain thiopurine toxicity in more than half of patients. Asians, despite the low prevalence of TPMT variants, are more susceptible to thiopurine toxicity. Since 2014, studies from many Asian countries have shown a strong association between nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X-type motif (NUDT) 15 polymorphism and thiopurine-induced myelotoxicity.An English language literature search was performed for TPMT and NUDT15 genetic variants in inflammatory bowel disease and other diseases. This article discusses the merits of preemptive NUDT15 and TPMT testing in Asian and non-Asian IBD populations.The NUDT polymorphism occurs in up to 27% of the Asian and Hispanic population. Hematological toxicity occurs in up to one-third of patients with this genetic variant. Given this, preemptive testing for NUDT15 variant is worthwhile and is probably more cost-effective than TPMT testing in these groups. Prevalence of NUDT15 variants is low in non-Finnish European population, but NUDT15 variants have been linked to myelotoxicity along with TPMT genetic variants. NUDT15 preemptive testing should be considered in the migrant Asian population in Europe and North America and in Caucasian populations who develop myelotoxicity.",no,yes,no,other,"safety, biomarker",,inflammatory bowel disease,3

Previously reserved for complicated or refractory forms, surgery is now considered as an alternative to medical treatment in localized ileocecal disease.This review examines factors associated with response to medical treatment and those associated with the need for surgery in ileocecal CD to identify the patients' profile for whom pharmacotherapy might be enough. Factors associated with the recurrence and the postoperative complications are also reviewed to help the clinician identify patients for whom medical therapy might be preferred.LIR!C study long-term follow-up data show that 38% of infliximab-treated patients were still treated with infliximab at the end of their follow-up, while 14% had switched to another biologic or had received immunomodulator or corticosteroid and 48% had CD-related surgery. Only the combination with an immunomodulator was associated with a greater likelihood of continuing infliximab. Patients with ileocecal CD for whom pharmacotherapy might be sufficient are probably those with no risk factors for CD-related surgery.In addition, patients with high risk of recurrence or of post-operative complications may benefit more from medical treatment than from surgery.",no,yes,no,other,effectiveness,,crohn's disease,3
2023-11-02,37407519,Alleviation of Photoreceptor Degeneration Based on Fullerenols in rd1 Mice by Reversing Mitochondrial Dysfunction via Modulation of Mitochondrial DNA Transcription and Leakage.,"Poor therapeutic outcomes of antioxidants in ophthalmologic clinical applications, including glutathione during photoreceptor degeneration in retinitis pigmentosa (RP), are caused by limited anti-oxidative capacity. In this study, fullerenols are synthesized and proven to be highly efficient in vitro radical scavengers. Fullerenol-based intravitreal injections significantly improve the flash electroretinogram and light/dark transition tests performed for 28 days on rd1 mice, reduce the thinning of retinal outer nuclear layers, and preserve the Rhodopsin, Gnat-1, and Arrestin expressions of photoreceptors. RNA-sequencing, RT-qPCR, and Western blotting validate that mitochondrial DNA (mt-DNA)-encoded genes of the electron transport chain (ETC), such as mt-Nd4l, mt-Co1, mt-Cytb, and mt-Atp6, are drastically downregulated in the retinas of rd1 mice, whereas nuclear DNA (n-DNA)-encoded genes, such as Ndufa1 and Atp5g3, are abnormally upregulated. Fullerenols thoroughly reverse the abnormal mt-DNA and n-DNA expression patterns of the ETC and restore mitochondrial function in degenerating photoreceptors. Additionally, fullerenols simultaneously repress Flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1)-mediated mt-DNA cleavage and mt-DNA leakage via voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) pores by downregulating the transcription of Fen1 and Vdac1, thereby inactivating the downstream pro-inflammatory cGAS-STING pathway. These findings demonstrate that fullerenols can effectively alleviate photoreceptor degeneration in rd1 mice and serve as a viable treatment for RP.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinopathy,3
2023-11-02,37420104,Salvianolic acid B ameliorates retinal deficits in an early-stage Alzheimer's disease mouse model through downregulating BACE1 and Aβ generation.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with subtle onset, early diagnosis remains challenging. Accumulating evidence suggests that the emergence of retinal damage in AD precedes cognitive impairment, and may serve as a critical indicator for early diagnosis and disease progression. Salvianolic acid B (Sal B), a bioactive compound isolated from the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Salvia miltiorrhiza, has been shown promise in treating neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD and Parkinson's disease. In this study we investigated the therapeutic effects of Sal B on retinopathy in early-stage AD. One-month-old transgenic mice carrying five familial AD mutations (5×FAD) were treated with Sal B (20 mg·kg-1·d-1, i.g.) for 3 months. At the end of treatment, retinal function and structure were assessed, cognitive function was evaluated in Morris water maze test. We showed that 4-month-old 5×FAD mice displayed distinct structural and functional deficits in the retinas, which were significantly ameliorated by Sal B treatment. In contrast, untreated, 4-month-old 5×FAD mice did not exhibit cognitive impairment compared to wild-type mice. In SH-SY5Y-APP751 cells, we demonstrated that Sal B (10 μM) significantly decreased BACE1 expression and sorting into the Golgi apparatus, thereby reducing Aβ generation by inhibiting the β-cleavage of APP. Moreover, we found that Sal B effectively attenuated microglial activation and the associated inflammatory cytokine release induced by Aβ plaque deposition in the retinas of 5×FAD mice. Taken together, our results demonstrate that functional impairments in the retina occur before cognitive decline, suggesting that the retina is a valuable reference for early diagnosis of AD. Sal B ameliorates retinal deficits by regulating APP processing and Aβ generation in early AD, which is a potential therapeutic intervention for early AD treatment.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinopathy,3

Articles from 1995 to 2023 were included. Pharmacologic treatment of diabetic retinopathy generally involves the use of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy for DME and PDR.

Intestinal pathology was observed, and full transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatic analysis were performed. The results demonstrated that acupuncture treatment reduced the UC symptoms, disease activity index score, and histological colitis score and increased body weight, colon length, and the number of intestinal goblet cells. In addition, acupuncture can also decrease the expression of necrotic biomarker phosphorylates mixed lineage kinase domain-like pseudo kinase (p-MLKL). Full-length transcriptome analysis indicated that acupuncture reversed the expression of 987 of the 1918 upregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and 632 of the 1351 downregulated DEGs induced by DSS. DEGs regulated by acupuncture were mainly involved in inflammatory responses and intestinal barrier pathways. The protein-protein interaction network analysis revealed that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are important genes regulated by acupuncture. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction was an important target of acupuncture. In addition, alternative splicing analysis suggested that acupuncture improved signaling pathways related to intestinal permeability, the biological processes of xenobiotics, sulfur compounds, and that monocarboxylic acids are closely associated with MMPs. Overall, our transcriptome analysis results indicate that acupuncture improves intestinal barrier function in UC through negative regulation of MMPs expression.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3

We aimed to study the clinical profile of pediatric cancer patients treated with RT and to analyze various challenges in pediatric RT under anesthesia.The data were prospectively maintained in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. Pediatric cancer patients aged 0-14 years, registered in the RT department between February 1, 2019 and July 30, 2021were analyzed.A total of 193 pediatric cancer patients (noncentral nervous system) received RT during the said period. Median age at presentation was 5.2 years (range: 9 months to 14 years) with a male-to-female ratio of 1.8:1. The majority of the patients were in the age group of 0-4 years (52.8%) followed by 5-9 years (29.5%) and ≥10 years (17.6%). Most common indications for RT included bone and soft-tissue tumors, retinoblastoma, Wilms tumor, neuroblastoma, and hematological malignancies. One hundred and seventy-nine (92.7%) patients received RT with curative intent, while 14 (7.3%) patients received palliative RT. Thirty (15.5%) patients needed anesthesia for RT. Ten (5.18%) patients required RT interruption due to toxicities with a median gap of 3 days.RT is challenging yet an important aspect of multidisciplinary care in paediatric cancers.

In this systematic review (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42022247992), we included 55 original articles published by 12 May 2023, which dealt with SHS exposure and ocular disorders, such as eye irritation, conjunctivitis, dry eye diseases, uveitis, myopia, astigmatism, contact lens discomfort, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and thyroid eye disease that addressed the ocular neurovascular structures of the macular, retinal nerve fiber layer, choroid, and corneal biomechanical parameters. We found compelling correlational evidence for eye irritation, conjunctivitis, and dry eye symptoms-supporting that SHS exposure was positively associated with inflammatory and allergic changes in the eyes. Yet, evidence about the associations between SHS exposure and other ocular disorders, structures, and parameters is still limited or controversial. Given the limitations of existing literature, more investigations with high quality and rigorous design are warranted to elucidate the potentially harmful effects of SHS exposure on ocular health.",no,yes,yes,other,"effectiveness, safety",,"dry eye, retinopathy",3

This review provides an aid to pending therapy decisions.In this review, we analyze the evidence for Crohn's disease as well as ulcerative colitis in order to optimize and 'personalize' the choice of therapy, especially in difficult cases. The relevant publications in Pubmed were identified in a continuous literature review with the key words 'Crohn´s disease' and 'ulcerative colitis.'Based on this complex data set following standard therapies steroid-refractory Crohn´s disease should preferentially be treated with combined infliximab plus azathioprine or risankizumab, in second line after their failure with ustekinumab or 7adalimumab. In steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis infliximab plus azathioprine or upadacitinib should be preferred in first line, filgotinib, tofacitinib or ustekinumab in second line.

Chronic inflammation can be a key factor for the occurrence of CRC thus mitigating an inflammation can be a preventive strategy for the occurrence of CRC. In this study we have explored the anti-inflammatory potential of phloretin, in in vitro gut inflammation model, developed by co-culture of Caco2 (intestinal epithelial) cells and RAW264.7 macrophages (immune cells). Phloretin is a dihydrochalcone present in apple, pear and strawberries. An anti-inflammatory effect of phloretin in reducing LPS induced inflammation and maintenance of transepithelial electric resistance (TEER) in Caco2 cells was examined. Paracellular permeability assay was performed using Lucifer yellow dye to evaluate the effect of phloretin in inhibiting gut leakiness caused by inflammatory mediators secreted by activated macrophages. Phloretin attenuated LPS induced nitric oxide levels, oxidative stress, depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential in Caco2 cells as evidenced by reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS), and enhancement of MMP, and decrease in inflammatory cytokines IL8, TNFα, IL1β and IL6. It exhibited anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting the expression of NFκB, iNOS and Cox2. Phloretin maintained the epithelial integrity by regulating the expression of tight junction proteins ZO1, occludin, Claudin1 and JAM. Phloretin reduced LPS induced levels of Cox2 along with the reduction in Src expression which further regulated an expression of tight junction protein occludin. Phloretin in combination to sodium pyruvate exhibited potential anti-inflammatory activity via targeting NFkB signaling.

However, the link between Fn-infected intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-derived exosomes (Fn-Exo) and UC progression has not been investigated. Differentially expressed miRNAs in Fn-Exo and non-infected IECs-derived exosomes (Con-Exo) were identified by miRNA sequencing. Then, the biological role and mechanism of Fn-Exo in UC development were determined in vitro and in vivo. We found that exosomes delivered miR-129-2-3p from Fn-infected IECs into non-infected IECs, exacerbating epithelial barrier dysfunction and experimental colitis. Mechanically, Fn-Exo induces DNA damage via the miR-129-2-3p/TIMELESS axis and subsequently activates the ATM/ATR/p53 pathway, ultimately promoting cellular senescence and colonic inflammation. In conclusion, Exo-miR-129-2-3p/TIMELESS/ATM/ATR/p53 pathway aggravates cellular senescence, barrier damage, and experimental colitis.

It has proven therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis.This narrative review assesses the safety profile of vedolizumab from the registration trial programs, open-label extension studies, observational real-world data, and pooled safety analyses. This includes an evaluation of the long-term overall safety in special populations typically underrepresented in clinical trials.Vedolizumab is an effective therapy for inflammatory bowel disease with a well-established safety profile. No unexpected long-term safety signals have been identified. Safety data in pregnancy, in pediatric and elderly populations, in patients undergoing surgery, and in patients with a prior history of cancer are reassuring. Due to its safety merits, we propose that vedolizumab is an excellent candidate for advanced combination treatment with an anti-cytokine approach using another biologic or novel small molecule inhibitor. This is important in patients with medically refractory IBD, in patients at high risk of developing disease-related complications, or in patients with concomitant uncontrolled immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.",no,yes,no,other,safety,,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",3

Although several therapeutic targets have been suggested in animal models of retinal ischemia and several potential treatments have been evaluated on small series of patients, central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is still rarely treatable in clinical practice.Here, we review several animal models of RAO, including increased intraocular pressure, laser, vasoconstriction, embolization and clamp. We also review the pathogenic mechanisms that contribute to cell death cascades during ischemia, and the therapeutic strategies targeting these events. These strategies aim to restore blood flow by fibrinolysis, increase the oxygen or glucose supply, decrease the energy demands, restrict ionic leak fluxes or reduce the detrimental effects of glutamate, calcium and free radicals. The current literature suggests that tPA treatment could be effective for CRAO.Eye care professionals must make a rapid and accurate diagnosis and immediately refer patients with acute retinal stroke to specialized centers. CRAO management should also be facilitated by developing local networks to encourage collaboration among ophthalmologists, retina specialists and stroke neurologists.",no,yes,no,animal,effectiveness,,retinal disease,3
2023-11-02,37698681,SMiT: symmetric mask transformer for disease severity detection.,"The application of deep learning methods to the intelligent diagnosis of diseases has been the focus of intelligent medical research. When dealing with image classification tasks, if the lesion area is small and uneven, the background image involved in the training will affect the ultimate accuracy in determining the extent of the lesion. We did not follow the traditional approach of building an intelligent system to assist physicians in diagnosis from the perspective of CNN models, but instead proposed a pure transformer framework that can be used for diagnostic grading of pathological images.We propose a Symmetric Mask Pre-Training vision Transformer SMiT model for grading pathological cancer images. SMiT performs a symmetrically identical high probability sparsification of the input image token sequence at the first and last encoder layer positions to pre-train visual transformers, and the parameters of the baseline model are fine-tuned after loading the pre-training weights, allowing the model to concentrate more on extracting detailed features in the lesion region, effectively getting rid of the potential feature dependency problem.SMiT achieved 92.8% classification accuracy on 4500 histopathological images of colorectal cancer processed by Gaussian filter denoising. We validated the effectiveness and generalizability of this study's methodology on the publicly available diabetic retinopathy dataset APTOS2019 from Kaggle and achieved quadratic Cohen Kappa, accuracy and F1-score of 91.9%, 86.91% and 72.85%, respectively, which were 1-2% better than previous studies based on CNN models.SMiT uses a simpler strategy to achieve better results to assist physicians in making accurate clinical decisions, which can be an inspiration for making good use of the visual transformers in the field of medical imaging.",no,yes,no,other,effectiveness,,retinopathy,3
2023-11-02,37751655,Roflumilast attenuates neuroinflammation post retinal ischemia/reperfusion injury by regulating microglia phenotype via the Nrf2/STING/NF-κB pathway.,"The abnormal polarisation of microglial cells (MGs) following retinal ischemia/reperfusion (RIR) initiates neuroinflammation and progressive death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), causing increasingly severe and irreversible visual dysfunction. Roflumilast (Roflu) is a promising candidate for treating neuroinflammatory diseases. This study aimed to explore whether Roflu displayed a cytoprotective effect against RIR-induced neuroinflammation and to characterise the underlying signalling pathway.The effects and mechanism of Roflu against RIR injury were investigated in C57BL/6J mice and the BV2 cell line. We used quantitative real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to examine the levels of inflammatory factors. Furthermore, haematoxylin and eosin and immunofluorescence (IF) stainings were used to assess the morphology of the retina and the states of MGs and RGCs. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were examined using a ROS assay kit, while whole-genome sequencing analysis was conducted to identify altered pathways and molecules. Western blotting and IF staining were used to quantify the proteins associated with the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/stimulator of interferon gene (STING)/nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-κB) pathway.MG polarisation includes the pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic M1 phenotype as well as the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective M2 phenotype. Roflu significantly attenuated MG activation and contributed to a shift in the MG phenotype from M1 to M2. Moreover, Roflu decreased ROS release and increased heme oxygenase 1 and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 expression. In vitro and in vivo experiments validated that Roflu exerted its neuroprotective effects primarily by upregulating the Nrf2/STING/NF-κB pathway. However, these effects were abrogated when the Nrf2 expression was inhibited by pharmacological or genetic manipulation.Roflu suppressed RIR-induced neuroinflammation by driving the shift of MG polarisation from M1 to M2 phenotype, which was mediated by the upregulation of the Nrf2/STING/NK-κB pathway.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,"retinopathy, retinal disease",3
2023-11-02,37781924,Perilipin 2-positive mononuclear phagocytes accumulate in the diabetic retina and promote PPARγ-dependent vasodegeneration.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), characterized by hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia, leads to nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR). NPDR is associated with blood-retina barrier disruption, plasma exudates, microvascular degeneration, elevated inflammatory cytokine levels, and monocyte (Mo) infiltration. Whether and how the diabetes-associated changes in plasma lipid and carbohydrate levels modify Mo differentiation remains unknown. Here, we show that mononuclear phagocytes (MPs) in areas of vascular leakage in DR donor retinas expressed perilipin 2 (PLIN2), a marker of intracellular lipid load. Strong upregulation of PLIN2 was also observed when healthy donor Mos were treated with plasma from patients with T2DM or with palmitate concentrations typical of those found in T2DM plasma, but not under high-glucose conditions. PLIN2 expression correlated with the expression of other key genes involved in lipid metabolism (ACADVL, PDK4) and the DR biomarkers ANGPTL4 and CXCL8. Mechanistically, we show that lipid-exposed MPs induced capillary degeneration in ex vivo explants that was inhibited by pharmaceutical inhibition of PPARγ signaling. Our study reveals a mechanism linking dyslipidemia-induced MP polarization to the increased inflammatory cytokine levels and microvascular degeneration that characterize NPDR. This study provides comprehensive insights into the glycemia-independent activation of Mos in T2DM and identifies MP PPARγ as a target for inhibition of lipid-activated MPs in DR.",no,yes,no,other,"biomarker, effectiveness",,retinopathy,3

Funduscopy revealed with yellow placoid lesions in the macula and near periphery. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography and fluorescein angiography revealed the presence of central intraretinal fluid in the left eye and multiple areas of macular ischaemia bilaterally. Treatment with oral corticosteroids was initiated, and the anatomical changes, including the intraretinal fluid, improved steadily over the following weeks.Although rare, the presence of subretinal or intraretinal fluid should not decrease the suspicion of acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy.

2023-11-02,37816735,Calbindin 2-specific deletion of arginase 2 preserves visual function after optic nerve crush.,"We previously found that global deletion of the mitochondrial enzyme arginase 2 (A2) limits optic nerve crush (ONC)-induced neuronal death. Herein, we examined the cell-specific role of A2 in this pathology by studies using wild type (WT), neuronal-specific calbindin 2 A2 KO (Calb2cre/+ A2 f/f), myeloid-specific A2 KO (LysMcre/+ A2f/f), endothelial-specific A2 KO (Cdh5cre/+ A2f/f), and floxed controls. We also examined the impact of A2 overexpression on mitochondrial function in retinal neuronal R28 cells. Immunolabeling showed increased A2 expression in ganglion cell layer (GCL) neurons of WT mice within 6 h-post injury and inner retinal neurons after 7 days. Calb2 A2 KO mice showed improved neuronal survival, decreased TUNEL-positive neurons, and improved retinal function compared to floxed littermates. Neuronal loss was unchanged by A2 deletion in myeloid or endothelial cells. We also found increased expression of neurotrophins (BDNF, FGF2) and improved survival signaling (pAKT, pERK1/2) in Calb2 A2 KO retinas within 24-hour post-ONC along with suppression of inflammatory mediators (IL1β, TNFα, IL6, and iNOS) and apoptotic markers (cleavage of caspase3 and PARP). ONC increased GFAP and Iba1 immunostaining in floxed controls, and Calb2 A2 KO dampened this effect. Overexpression of A2 in R28 cells increased Drp1 expression, and decreased mitochondrial respiration, whereas ABH-induced inhibition of A2 decreased Drp1 expression and improved mitochondrial respiration. Finally, A2 overexpression or excitotoxic treatment with glutamate significantly impaired mitochondrial function in R28 cells as shown by significant reductions in basal respiration, maximal respiration, and ATP production. Further, glutamate treatment of A2 overexpressing cells did not induce further deterioration in their mitochondrial function, indicating that A2 overexpression or glutamate insult induce comparable alterations in mitochondrial function. Our data indicate that neuronal A2 expression is neurotoxic after injury, and A2 deletion in Calb2 expressing neurons limits ONC-induced retinal neurodegeneration and improves visual function.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,retinopathy,3
2023-11-02,37841565,Current Understanding of Dietary Fiber and Its Role in Chronic Diseases.,"Dietary fiber (DF) is an essential, albeit under-consumed, component in the North American diet. DF is thought to have anti-inflammatory disease-modifying effects via DF-related gut microbiota degradation products called short chain fatty acids. Thus far studies have shown the greatest associations between DF intake and risk reduction in obesity, improved weight loss outcomes, and risk reduction of cardiovascular disease (CVD). There is weak evidence associating DF intake and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) risk, IBD remission, reduced risk of Crohn's disease (CD flares, and no evidence showing any benefit towards ulcerative colitis (UC) specifically. Evidence on DF intake and the risk reduction of colorectal cancer (CRC) has been equivocal. Studies were limited by a lack of randomization or in controlling fiber types and sources. Based on the current beneficial associations of DF on obesity management and CVD, counseling patients to increase DF intake may be a cost-effective measure to decrease the burden of chronic disease.",no,yes,no,other,effectiveness,,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",3

In the past few years, some reports have suggested that PHZ may have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Herein, we have attempted to assess the protective effects of PHZ on dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice and to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our results suggested that early intervention with PHZ (20, 40, and 80 mg/kg) significantly reduced the severity of DSS-induced colitis in mice, as presented by a longer colon, improved tight junction protein, decreased disease activity index, and attenuated inflammatory factors. Additionally, early intervention with + (20, 40, and 80 mg/kg) significantly inhibited ferroptosis by decreasing the surrogate ferroptosis marker levels (MDA and Iron Content). Additionally, PHZ (80 mg/kg) increased the diversity of intestinal flora in colitic mice by elevating the levels of beneficial bacteria (Lactobacillaceae and Muribaculaceae) and reducing the levels of harmful bacteria (Lachnospiraceae). This indirectly led to an increase in the amount of short-chain fatty acids. A fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) test was conducted to show that PHZ (80 mg/kg) ameliorated ulcerative colitis (UC) by regulating gut dysbiosis. In conclusion, early intervention with PHZ decreased DSS-induced colitis in mice by preserving their intestinal barrier and regulating their intestinal flora.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3
2023-11-02,37856434,Identification of OLA1 as a Novel Protein Target of Vitexin to Ameliorate Dextran Sulfate Sodium-Induced Colitis with Tissue Thermal Proteome Profiling.,"Vitexin, which exists in various medicinal plants and food sources, has recently received increasing attention because of its anti-inflammatory properties. This study aims to identify the protein target of vitexin that ameliorates dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. The results showed that vitexin not only alleviated the clinical symptoms and colonic damage in mice with DSS-induced colitis but also suppressed the colonic production of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, ICAM, and VCAM) and enhanced the expression of barrier-associated proteins (ZO-1, Occludin, and E-cadherin). Based on tissue thermal proteome profiling (Tissue-TPP) and molecular docking, OLA1 was creatively identified as a potential protein target for vitexin. Further siRNA-mediated knockdown of the OLA1 gene in Caco-2 cells demonstrated the ability of OLA1 to increase Nrf2 protein expression and, thus, mediated the anti-inflammatory effects of vitexin. Interaction of the OLA1-vitexin complex with Keap1 protein to disrupt the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction may be required for activating Nrf2. Our findings revealed a novel role for OLA1 as a protein target of vitexin that contributes to its anti-inflammatory action by activating Nrf2, which may provide a promising molecular mechanism for novel therapeutic strategies to treat colitis and the associated systemic inflammation.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3

Our aim is to present the varied appearance of the disease and to present the various therapeutic options. Retinal artery macroaneurysm is a rare, but potentially vision-threatening ophthalmic condition. Macroaneurysm develops from the arteriosclerotic transformation of the artery caused by high blood pressure. Macroaneurysms can be asymptomatic, or they can be associated with exudative or hemorrhagic complication which causes visual impairment. Depending on the symptoms, they can be treated with laser photocoagulation, intravitreal injections, or with vitrectomy. Our presented cases also illustrate that each case requires individual consideration because a uniform therapeutic recommendation is still yet to be developed.

We have shown human recombinant retina-specific laminin isoform matrix is able to support the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to photoreceptor progenitors. In addition, sub-retinal injection of these cells has also shown partial restoration in the rd10 rodent and rabbit models. Sub-retinal injection is known to be an established method that has been used to deliver pharmaceutical compounds to the photoreceptor cells and retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) layer of the eye due to its proximity to the target space. It has also been used to deliver adeno-associated viral vectors into the sub-retinal space to treat retinal diseases. The sub-retinal delivery of pharmaceutical compounds and cells in the murine model is challenging due to the constraint in the size of the murine eyeball. This protocol describes the detailed procedure for the preparation of hESC-derived photoreceptor progenitor cells for injection and the sub-retinal delivery technique of these cells in genetic retinitis pigmentosa mutant, rd10 mice.

Thromboembolic phenomena are a frequent complication in IBD, because of hypercoagulability states associated with disease activity, and their presence has a negative impact on prognosis and patient survival. Due to this, the control of the inflammatory activity of IBD is one of the pillars in the control of thromboembolic events. Biological drugs are associated with rapid control of the inflammatory process, however, the security profile for the reactivation of latent infections, particularly tuberculosis, is always discussed. We present the case of a 37-year-old patient who presented with deep vein thrombosis in the left lower limb and later with massive pulmonary thromboembolism.

There was localized loss of inner segment ellipsoid (EZ) and photoreceptor outer segment signals (IZ) in the pericentral retina of both eyes co-localizing with hyperreflective lesions on near-infrared reflectance. She subsequently lost vision (visual acuity = 20/200) in the right eye a year after consolidative peripheral blood stem cell transplantation complicated by steroid-resistant-chronic graft-versus-host disease. There was loss of the EZ and IZ signals corresponding to a dense central cone scotoma and multifocal electroretinograms depression. Near-infrared autofluorescence, fluorescein and optical coherence tomography angiography were within normal limits. Visual acuity (20/20) and retinal sensitivities improved with restoration of the EZ/IZ signals after oral prednisone and intravenous rituximab, but left a residual photoreceptor loss and paracentral scotoma.We propose that an immune-mediated microangiopathy may explain the protracted, recurrent course of primary photoreceptor abnormalities in our patient, which was further complicated by manifestations of chronic graft-versus-host disease following consolidative peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.

2023-11-02,37903378,The significance of nutritional strategies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease in the context of malnutrition and the development of malnourished obesity.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, despite the increasing incidence, still do not have a specific etiology. Diet seems to be an important factor, modifying the occurrence of the disease and its course. Diet can affect the symptoms of IBD both directly, e.g., by alleviating diarrhea, bloating and constipation, and indirectly by shaping the microbiota. Bacterial metabolites produced under the influence of supplied nutrients may contribute to the modulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways, depending on the diet used. So far, IBD has been associated with weight loss and malnutrition. In recent years, a trend of sarcopenic obesity with concomitant malnutrition has been observed. The new phenomenon is called malnubesity. This work aims to review the most commonly used diets in IBD in order to evaluate them in terms of alleviating ailments, but also maintaining proper nutritional status and lack of obesity. Low-fiber, low FODMAPs, Mediterranean diet and Crohn's Disease Exclusion Diet diet were considered. We assume that diet is modifiable factor that is related to nutritional status and healthy body weight.

2023-11-02,37904100,PVA enema ameliorates DSS-induced acute colitis in mice.,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) represents a clinically challenging condition characterized by persistent damage to the colonic epithelial mucosa as the principal pathological feature. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution, primarily composed of glue, is a biodegradable polymer material that has found utility in the medical field. This research endeavors to investigate the therapeutic potential of PVA water solution in ameliorating UC in mice.UC was induced in 48 C57BL/6 mice by administering 2.5% DSS in their diet for 6 days. Mice were treated with different concentrations of PVA (0.1 mg/ml PVA, 0.3 mg/ml PVA, 1 mg/ml PVA, 3 mg/ml PVA, 10 mg/ml PVA) enemas (n = 6). Disease Activity Index (DAI) and histologic score were evaluated for inflammation degree. Furthermore, mouse colon organoids were cultured, which were used to assess the effects of PVA on expansion in vitro.PVA aqueous solutions (1 mg/ml and 3 mg/ml) were able to alleviate the DAI in mice. By DAY 6, there was a significant 3/5-fold decrease in DAI within the 1 mg/ml PVA group (p = 0.02). Histopathology scores demonstrated improvements, while the levels of inflammatory factors in the intestinal mucosal tissue were reduced. Additionally, it was confirmed that PVA could promote the expansion of colonic organoids in vitro.In summary, our investigation has yielded findings indicating that PVA holds the potential to ameliorate symptoms associated with colitis in murine subjects afflicted by DSS-induced colitis, primarily through its facilitation of intestinal stem cell expansion.

2023-11-02,37904133,Neutral sphingomyelinase inhibition promotes local and network degeneration in vitro and in vivo.,"Cell-to-cell communication is vital for tissues to respond, adapt, and thrive in the prevailing milieu. Several mechanisms mediate intercellular signaling, including tunneling nanotubes, gap junctions, and extracellular vesicles (EV). Depending on local and systemic conditions, EVs may contain cargoes that promote survival, neuroprotection, or pathology. Our understanding of pathologic intercellular signaling has been bolstered by disease models using neurons derived from human pluripotent stems cells (hPSC).Here, we used hPSC-derived retinal ganglion cells (hRGC) and the mouse visual system to investigate the influence of modulating EV generation on intercellular trafficking and cell survival. We probed the impact of EV modulation on cell survival by decreasing the catabolism of sphingomyelin into ceramide through inhibition of neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase), using GW4869. We assayed for cell survival in vitro by probing for annexin A5, phosphatidylserine, viable mitochondria, and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. In vivo, we performed intraocular injections of GW4869 and measured RGC and superior colliculus neuron density and RGC anterograde axon transport.Following twenty-four hours of dosing hRGCs with GW4869, we found that inhibition of nSMase decreased ceramide and enhanced GM1 ganglioside accumulation. This inhibition also reduced the density of small EVs, increased the density of large EVs, and enriched the pro-apoptotic protein, annexin A5. Reducing nSMase activity increased hRGC apoptosis initiation due to enhanced density and uptake of apoptotic particles, as identified by the annexin A5 binding phospholipid, phosphatidylserine. We assayed intercellular trafficking of mitochondria by developing a coculture system of GW4869-treated and naïve hRGCs. In treated cells, inhibition of nSMase reduced the number of viable mitochondria, while driving mitochondrial reactive oxygen species not only in treated, but also in naive hRGCs added in coculture. In mice, 20 days following a single intravitreal injection of GW4869, we found a significant loss of RGCs and their axonal recipient neurons in the superior colliculus. This followed a more dramatic reduction in anterograde RGC axon transport to the colliculus.Overall, our data suggest that perturbing the physiologic catabolism of sphingomyelin by inhibiting nSMase reorganizes plasma membrane associated sphingolipids, alters the profile of neuron-generated EVs, and promotes neurodegeneration in vitro and in vivo by shifting the balance of pro-survival versus -degenerative EVs.

Numbers of presentations and admissions for key ophthalmic conditions were stratified by age, socioeconomic status, location (metropolitan versus rural), and triage category. From the observations occurring in the pre-pandemic period (January 2018 to March 2020), a linear regression prediction model was built for each diagnosis which predicted what the presentation number in the COVID-19 period would have been if the pandemic had not occurred.Based on pre-COVID-19 trends, the largest decreases in expected admissions were for glaucoma (32.9%) and retinal breaks and detachments (21.2%). For the ED data, the most apparent changes were: an increase in presentations for foreign bodies (22.6%); a decrease in retinal detachments (35.5%); and a decrease in keratitis (18.4%) relative to predictions.Hospital admissions decreased and patterns of ED attendances changed during lockdown. The findings suggest the need for the following: increased safety messaging to avoid eye injuries around the home; improved pathways for safe and rapid triaging of eye conditions in the community to ensure effective use of ED resources; and messaging to ensure that people do not delay care when they notice signs of sight-threatening conditions such as retinal detachment.",no,yes,no,other,"effectiveness, safety",,retinal disease,3

Rhesus nonhuman primates, aged 15 to 17 years, were fed a high-fat diet (n = 7) for >5 years reflective of the traditional WD. Age-matched controls (n = 6) were fed a standard laboratory primate diet. Retinal fundus photography, optical coherence tomography, autofluorescence imaging, and fluorescein angiography were performed before euthanasia. To assess diabetic retinopathy (DR), eyes were examined using trypsin digests, lipofuscin autofluorescence, and multimarker immunofluorescence on cross-sections and whole mounts. Retinal imaging showed venous engorgement and tortuosity, aneurysms, macular exudates, dot and blot hemorrhages, and a marked increase in fundus autofluorescence. Post-mortem changes included the following: decreased CD31 blood vessel density (P < 0.05); increased acellular capillaries (P < 0.05); increased density of ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule expressing amoeboid microglia/macrophage; loss of regular distribution in stratum and spacing typical of ramified microglia; and increased immunoreactivity of aquaporin 4 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (P < 0.05).

For the purpose of this review, we focused on the diagnosis of some of the most common inflammatory and structural pouch disorders and their respective management. Pouchitis is the most common complication, and it is typically responsive to antibiotics. However, chronic antibiotic refractory pouchitis (CARP) has been increasingly recognized, and biologic therapies have emerged as the mainstay of therapy. Crohn's-like disease of the pouch (CLDP) can affect up to 10% of patients with UC after IPAA. Medical options are similar to CARP therapies, including biologics with immunomodulators. Studies have shown higher efficacy rates of biologics for CLDP when compared with those for CARP. In addition, managing stricturing and fistulizing CLDP is challenging and often requires interventional endoscopy (balloon dilation and/or stricturotomy) and/or surgery. The implementation of standardized diagnostic criteria for inflammatory pouch disorders will help in advancing future therapeutic options. Structural pouch disorders are commonly related to surgical complications after IPAA. We focused on the diagnosis and management of anastomotic leaks, strictures, and floppy pouch complex. Anastomotic leaks and anastomotic strictures occur in approximately 15% and 11% of patients with UC after IPAA, respectively. Further complications from pouch leaks include the development of sinuses, fistulas, and pouch sepsis requiring excision. Novel endoscopic interventions and less invasive surgical procedures have emerged as options for the management of these disorders.",no,yes,no,other,"effectiveness, safety",,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",3

Any part of the colon may be affected, beginning with inflammation of the mucosa in the rectum and continuing proximally continuously. Bloody diarrhea, tenesmus, fecal urgency, and stomach pain are typical presenting symptoms. Many patients present with extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) including musculoskeletal, ocular, renal, hepatobiliary, and dermatological presentation, among others. Most cases are treated with pharmacological therapy including mesalazine and glucocorticoids. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a novel procedure that is increasingly being used to treat UC, however, its use yet remains controversial because of uncertain efficacy. FMT can lower gut permeability and consequently disease severity by boosting short-chain fatty acids production, helping in epithelial barrier integrity preservation. Upadacitinib (JAK Kinase inhibitor) is another newer treatment option, which is an FDA-approved drug that is being used to treat UC.

Distinct from the separate symptom of increased stool frequency, BU has a substantial negative impact on quality of life and psychosocial functioning. Among patients with UC, BU is one of the top reasons for treatment dissatisfaction and one of the symptoms patients most want improved. Patients may not discuss BU often due to embarrassment, and healthcare providers may not address the symptom adequately due to the lack of awareness of validated tools and/or knowledge of the importance of assessing BU. The mechanism of BU in UC is multifactorial and includes inflammatory changes in the rectum that may be linked to hypersensitivity and reduced compliance of the rectum. Responsive and reliable patient-reported outcome measures of BU are needed to provide evidence of treatment benefits in clinical trials and facilitate communication in clinical practice. This review discusses the pathophysiology and clinical importance of BU in UC and its impact on the quality of life and psychosocial functioning. Patient-reported outcome measures developed to assess the severity of BU in UC are discussed alongside overviews of treatment options and clinical guidelines.

2023-11-03,37739041,Safety of surfactant excipients in oral drug formulations.,"Surfactants are a diverse group of compounds that share the capacity to adsorb at the boundary between distinct phases of matter. They are used as pharmaceutical excipients, food additives, emulsifiers in cosmetics, and as household/industrial detergents. This review outlines the interaction of surfactant-type excipients present in oral pharmaceutical dosage forms with the intestinal epithelium of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Many surfactants permitted for human consumption in oral products reduce intestinal epithelial cell viability in vitro and alter barrier integrity in epithelial cell monolayers, isolated GI tissue mucosae, and in animal models. This suggests a degree of mis-match for predicting safety issues in humans from such models. Recent controversial preclinical research also infers that some widely used emulsifiers used in oral products may be linked to ulcerative colitis, some metabolic disorders, and cancers. We review a wide range of surfactant excipients in oral dosage forms regarding their interactions with the GI tract. Safety data is reviewed across in vitro, ex vivo, pre-clinical animal, and human studies. The factors that may mitigate against some of the potentially abrasive effects of surfactants on GI epithelia observed in pre-clinical studies are summarised. We conclude with a perspective on the overall safety of surfactants in oral pharmaceutical dosage forms, which has relevance for delivery system development.",no,yes,yes,other,safety,,ulcerative colitis,3
2023-11-03,37743772,A tryptophan metabolite made by a gut microbiome eukaryote induces pro-inflammatory T cells.,"The large intestine harbors microorganisms playing unique roles in host physiology. The beneficial or detrimental outcome of host-microbiome coexistence depends largely on the balance between regulators and responder intestinal CD4+ T cells. We found that ulcerative colitis-like changes in the large intestine after infection with the protist Blastocystis ST7 in a mouse model are associated with reduction of anti-inflammatory Treg cells and simultaneous expansion of pro-inflammatory Th17 responders. These alterations in CD4+ T cells depended on the tryptophan metabolite indole-3-acetaldehyde (I3AA) produced by this single-cell eukaryote. I3AA reduced the Treg subset in vivo and iTreg development in vitro by modifying their sensing of TGFβ, concomitantly affecting recognition of self-flora antigens by conventional CD4+ T cells. Parasite-derived I3AA also induces over-exuberant TCR signaling, manifested by increased CD69 expression and downregulation of co-inhibitor PD-1. We have thus identified a new mechanism dictating CD4+ fate decisions. The findings thus shine a new light on the ability of the protist microbiome and tryptophan metabolites, derived from them or other sources, to modulate the adaptive immune compartment, particularly in the context of gut inflammatory disorders.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3
2023-11-03,37774953,Experimental and mathematical approaches for drug delivery for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration.,"Several chronic eye diseases affect the posterior segment of the eye. Among them age-related macular degeneration can cause vision loss if left untreated and is one of the leading causes of visual impairment in the world. Most treatments are based on intravitreally injected therapeutics that inhibit the action of vascular endothelial growth factor. However, due to the need for monthly injections, this method is associated with poor patient compliance. To address this problem, numerous drug delivery systems (DDSs) have been developed. This review covers a selection of particulate systems, non-stimuli responsive hydrogels, implants, and composite systems that have been developed in the last few decades. Depending on the type of DDS, polymer material, and preparation method, different mechanical properties and drug release profiles can be achieved. Furthermore, DDS development can be optimized by implementing mathematical modeling of both drug release and pharmacokinetic aspects. Several existing mathematical models for diffusion-controlled, swelling-controlled, and erosion-controlled drug delivery from polymeric systems are summarized. Compartmental and physiologically based models for ocular drug transport and pharmacokinetics that have studied drug concentration profiles after intravitreal delivery or release from a DDS are also reviewed. The coupling of drug release models with ocular pharmacokinetic models can lead to obtaining much more efficient DDSs for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration and other diseases of the posterior segment of the eye.",no,yes,yes,other,effectiveness,,retinal disease,3
2023-11-03,37820984,Schwann cell-derived extracellular vesicles as a potential therapy for retinal ganglion cell degeneration.,"Optic neuropathy is the leading cause of irreversible blindness and is characterized by progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Several studies have demonstrated that transplantation of Schwann cells (SCs) is a promising candidate therapy for optic neuropathy and that intravitreally transplanted cells exert their effect via paracrine actions. Extracellular vesicle (EV)-based therapies are increasingly recognized as a potential strategy for cell replacement therapy. In this study, we aimed to investigate the neuroprotective and regenerative effects of SC-EVs following optic nerve injury. We found that SC-EVs were internalized by RGCs in vitro and in vivo without any transfection reagents. Intriguingly, SC-EVs significantly enhanced the survival and axonal growth of primary RGCs in a coculture system. In a rat optic nerve crush model, SC-EVs mitigated RGC degeneration, prevented RGC loss, and preserved the thickness of the ganglion cell complex, as demonstrated by the statistically significant improvement in RGC counts and thickness measurements. Mechanistically, SC-EVs activated the cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) signaling pathway and regulated reactive gliosis in ONC rats, which is crucial for RGC protection and axonal regeneration. These findings provide novel insights into the neuroprotective and regenerative properties of SC-EVs, suggesting their potential as a cell-free therapeutic strategy and natural biomaterials for neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinal disease,3
2023-11-03,37864169,Impairing Gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis is protective against retinal degeneration.,"Inflammasome activation and the subsequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines including Interleukin 1β (IL-1β) have been widely reported to contribute to the progression of retinal degenerations, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness in the Western World. The role of Gasdermin D (GSDMD), a key executioner of pyroptosis following inflammasome activation, however, is less well-established. In this study we aimed to characterise the role of GSDMD in the healthy and degenerating retina, and uncover its role as a conduit for IL-1β release, including via extracellular vesicle (EV)-mediated release.GSDMD mutant and knockout mice, in vitro models of inflammation and a well-established in vivo model of retinal degeneration (photo-oxidative damage; PD) were utilised to explore the role and pathological contribution of GSDMD in regulating IL-1β release and propagating retinal inflammation. RNA sequencing of whole retinas was used to investigate GSDMD-mediated inflammation during degeneration. The role of EVs in GSDMD-mediated IL-1β release was investigated using nanoparticle tracking analysis, ELISA and EV inhibition paradigms. Finally, the therapeutic efficacy of targeting GSDMD was examined using GSDMD-specific siRNA.We identified in this work that mice deficient in GSDMD had better-preserved retinal function, increased photoreceptor survivability and reduced inflammation. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that GSDMD may propagate inflammation in the retina via NF-κB signalling cascades and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We also showed that IL-1β was packaged and released via EV in a GSDMD-dependent manner. Finally, we demonstrated that impairing GSDMD function using RNAi or blocking EV release was able to reduce IL-1β content in cell-free supernatant and EV.Taken together, these results suggest that pyroptotic pore-forming protein GSDMD plays a key role in the propagation of retinal inflammation, in particular via the release of EV-encapsulated IL-1β. Targeting GSDMD using genetic or pharmacological inhibitors may pose a therapeutic opportunity to dampen inflammatory cascades and delay the progression of retinal degeneration.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinal disease,3

2023-11-06,36739089,IL-17-driven induction of Paneth cell antimicrobial functions protects the host from microbiota dysbiosis and inflammation in the ileum.,"Interleukin (IL)-17 protects epithelial barriers by inducing the secretion of antimicrobial peptides. However, the effect of IL-17 on Paneth cells (PCs), the major producers of antimicrobial peptides in the small intestine, is unclear. Here, we show that the targeted ablation of the IL-17 receptor (IL-17R) in PCs disrupts their antimicrobial functions and decreases the frequency of ileal PCs. These changes become more pronounced after colonization with IL-17 inducing segmented filamentous bacteria. Mice with PCs that lack IL-17R show an increased inflammatory transcriptional profile in the ileum along with the severity of experimentally induced ileitis. These changes are associated with a decrease in the diversity of gut microbiota that induces a severe ileum pathology upon transfer to genetically susceptible mice, which can be prevented by the systemic administration of IL-17a/f in microbiota recipients. In an exploratory analysis of a small cohort of pediatric patients with Crohn's disease, we have found that a portion of these patients exhibits a low number of lysozyme-expressing ileal PCs and a high ileitis severity score, resembling the phenotype of mice with IL-17R-deficient PCs. Our study identifies IL-17R-dependent signaling in PCs as an important mechanism that maintains ileal homeostasis through the prevention of dysbiosis.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,crohn's disease,3

The treatment is still challenging. This study aimed to explore the therapeutic role and mechanism of exosomes obtained from the supernatant of stem cells derived from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED-exos) in sialadenitis caused by SS.SHED-exos were administered to the submandibular glands (SMGs) of 14-week-old non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, an animal model of the clinical phase of SS, by local injection or intraductal infusion. The saliva flow rate was measured after pilocarpine intraperitoneal injection in 21-week-old NOD mice. Protein expression was examined by western blot analysis. Exosomal microRNA (miRNAs) were identified by microarray analysis. Paracellular permeability was evaluated by transepithelial electrical resistance measurement.SHED-exos were injected into the SMG of NOD mice and increased saliva secretion. The injected SHED-exos were taken up by glandular epithelial cells, and further increased paracellular permeability mediated by zonula occluden-1 (ZO-1). A total of 180 exosomal miRNAs were identified from SHED-exos, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis suggested that the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway might play an important role. SHED-exos treatment down-regulated phospho-Akt (p-Akt)/Akt, phospho-glycogen synthase kinase 3β (p-GSK-3β)/GSK-3β, and Slug expressions and up-regulated ZO-1 expression in SMGs and SMG-C6 cells. Both the increased ZO-1 expression and paracellular permeability induced by SHED-exos were abolished by insulin-like growth factor 1, a PI3K agonist. Slug bound to the ZO-1 promoter and suppressed its expression. For safer and more effective clinical application, SHED-exos were intraductally infused into the SMGs of NOD mice, and saliva secretion was increased and accompanied by decreased levels of p-Akt/Akt, p-GSK-3β/GSK-3β, and Slug and increased ZO-1 expression.Local application of SHED-exos in SMGs can ameliorate Sjögren syndrome-induced hyposalivation by increasing the paracellular permeability of glandular epithelial cells through Akt/GSK-3β/Slug pathway-mediated ZO-1 expression.",no,yes,no,animal,effectiveness,,sjögren's syndrome,3

The internal anesthesia record system was used to calculate time estimates, and financial calculations were constructed from published literature and internal sources. A TDABC analysis was used to determine the costs of standard and complex PPVs. Average reimbursement was based on Medicare rates.The primary outcomes were the total costs for standard and complex PPVs and the resulting net margin at current Medicare reimbursement levels. The secondary outcomes were the differential in surgical times, costs, and margin for standard and complex PPV.Over the 2021 calendar year, a total of 270 standard and 142 complex PPVs were included in the analysis. Complex PPVs were associated with significantly increased anesthesia time (52.28 minutes; P < 0.001), operating room time (51.28 minutes; P < 0.0001), surgery time (43.64 minutes; P < 0.0001), and postoperative time (25.95 minutes; P < 0.0001). The total day-of-surgery costs were $5154.59 and $7852.38 for standard and complex PPVs, respectively. Postoperative visits incurred an additional cost of $327.84 and $353.86 for standard and complex PPV, respectively. The institution-specific facility payments were $4505.50 and $4935.14 for standard and complex PPV, respectively. Standard PPV yielded a net negative margin of -$976.93, whereas complex PPV yielded a net negative margin of -$3271.10.This analysis demonstrated that Medicare reimbursement is inadequate in covering the costs of PPV for retinal detachment, with a particularly large negative margin for more complex cases.

In this review, we highlight the roles of TGF-β1 in immunity, focusing mainly on its ability to promote differentiation of regulatory T cells, T helper (Th)-17, and Th9 cells, thus contributing to amplifying or restricting T-cell responses in health and human diseases (e.g., inflammatory bowel diseases, type 1 diabetes, asthma, and MS). In addition, we discuss the involvement of Smad7, an inhibitor of TGF-β1 signaling, in immune-mediated disorders (e.g., psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, MS, and inflammatory bowel diseases), as well as the discordant results of clinical trials with mongersen, an oral pharmaceutical compound containing a Smad7 antisense oligonucleotide, in patients with Crohn's disease. Further work is needed to ascertain the reasons for such a discrepancy as well as to identify better candidates for treatment with Smad7 inhibitors.",no,yes,yes,other,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",3
2023-11-06,37640142,Development of experimental treatments for patients with retinitis pigmentosa.,"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited diseases that lead to degeneration of the retina and decreased vision. The World Health Organization reports around 1,300 million people affected by some type of visual impairment worldwide. The prevalence is 1 in every 4000 inhabitants and it is the first cause of blindness of genetic origin, frequent in men with a percentage of 60% and 40% in women. There is a lack of information on this pathology in the world, mainly on the existing treatments for this disease, so this bibliographic review aims to update the existing or under-study treatments and inform the limitations of each of these therapies. This review of scientific literature was carried out by consulting databases such as PubMed and Web of science, the search will be limited to articles from the years 2018-2022. There are several types of therapy in studies: gene therapy, transcorneal electrical stimulation, use of neuroprotectors, optogenic therapy, stem cell transplants and oligonucleotide therapy, which will be discussed in this article, both their benefits and the existing barriers in each treatment experimental. In conclusion, each of these therapies promises a viable treatment in the future for selective groups of people with retinitis pigmentosa, however, some therapies have shown benefit at the beginning of the disease, losing their efficacy in the long term.",no,yes,no,other,effectiveness,,retinitis pigmentosa,3
2023-11-06,37705491,Red Light-Triggered Anti-Angiogenic and Photodynamic Combination Therapy of Age-Related Macular Degeneration.,"Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is the key pathological event of wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) leading to irreversible vision loss. Currently, anti-angiogenic therapy with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents has become the standard treatment for wAMD, while it is still subject to several limitations, including the safety concerns of monthly intravitreal administration and insufficient efficacy for neovascular occlusion. Combined therapy with photodynamic therapy (PDT) and anti-angiogenic agents has emerged as a novel treatment paradigm. Herein, a novel and less-invasive approach is reported to achieve anti-angiogenic and photodynamic combination therapy of wAMD by intravenous administration of a photoactivatable nanosystem (Di-DAS-VER NPs). The nanosystem is self-assembled by reactive oxygen species (ROS)-sensitive dasatinib (DAS) prodrug and photosensitizer verteporfin (VER). After red-light irradiation to the diseased eyes, intraocular release of anti-angiogenic DAS is observed, together with selective neo-vessels occlusion by VER-generated ROS. Notably, Di-DAS-VER NPs demonstrates promising therapeutic efficacy against CNV with minimized systemic toxicity. The study enables an efficient intravenous wAMD therapy by integrating a photoactivation process with combinational therapeutics into one simple nanosystem.",no,yes,no,other,"effectiveness, safety",,retinal disease,3
2023-11-06,37729776,Suppression of mir-150-5p attenuates the anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticoids in mice with ulcerative colitis.,"Glucocorticoids have been widely used in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, but not all patients benefit from this therapy due to hormone resistance. Mir-150-5p has been reported to enhance the efficacy of glucocorticoids, and low serum mir-150-5p expression has been linked to glucocorticoid resistance in ulcerative colitis patients. The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms of mir-150-5p regulation on glucocorticoid resistance. An ulcerative colitis mouse model was used to evaluate changes in ulcerative colitis symptoms, inflammatory factors, and glucocorticoid resistance-related gene expression. The results showed that mir-150-5p suppression with antagomirs did not significantly interfere with or enhance the induction of ulcerative colitis symptoms by dextran sulfate sodium, but it did attenuate the inflammation inhibitory effect of dexamethasone by abnormally regulating the expression of IL-17a, IL-10, IL-2 and IL-6 levels and myeloperoxidase activity. Mir-150-5p inhibition also induced a glucocorticoid-resistant gene expression profile in colon tissues of ulcerative colitis mice, with upregulation of p-ERK, p-JNK, and HSP90 and downregulation of p-GRa, FKBP4, and HDAC2 expression. Our results indicate that mir-150-5p suppression attenuates the anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticoids and may function as a driver element in ulcerative colitis glucocorticoid resistance.

2023-11-06,37752703,"Preclinical evaluation of KH631, a novel rAAV8 gene therapy product for neovascular age-related macular degeneration.","The upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is strongly associated with the development of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). Currently, the standard treatment for nAMD involves frequent intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents, which inhibit the growth of new blood vessels and prevent leakage. However, this treatment regimen places a significant burden on patients, their families, and healthcare providers due to the need for repeated visits to the clinic for injections. Gene therapy, which enables the sustained expression of anti-VEGF proteins after a single injection, can dramatically reduce the treatment burden. KH631 is a recombinant adeno-associated virus 8 vector that encodes a human VEGF receptor fusion protein, and it is being developed as a long-term treatment for nAMD. In preclinical studies using non-human primates, subretinal administration of KH631 at a low dose of 3 × 108 vg/eye resulted in remarkable retention of the transgene product in the retina and prevented the formation and progression of grade IV CNV lesions. Furthermore, sustained transgene expression was observed for more than 96 weeks. These findings suggest that a single subretinal injection of KH631 has the potential to offer a one-time, low-dose treatment for nAMD patients.",no,yes,no,animal,effectiveness,,retinal disease,3

Calcium imaging and patch clamp were applied to analyze the actions of ZPT in human vascular endothelial cells. Mouse model of UC was used to evaluate the anti-colitic action of ZPT.ZPT dose-dependently induced mesenteric vasorelaxation predominately through endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization (EDH), which could be attenuated by intracellular Zn2+ and Ca2+ chelators TPEN and BAPTA-AM. The ZPT/EDH-mediated vasorelaxation via TRPV1, TRPV4 and TRPA1 channels was verified by a combination of selective pharmacological inhibitors and TRPV1-KO and TRPV4-KO mice. Moreover. ZPT induced Ca2+ entry via vascular endothelial TRPV1/4 and TRPA1 channels and enhanced membrane non-selective currents through these channels. Notably, ZPT exerted anti-colitic effects by rescuing the impaired acetylcholine (ACh)-induced mesenteric vasorelaxation in colitic mice.ZPT/Zn2+ induces EDH-mediated mesenteric vasorelaxation through activating endothelial multiple TRPV1/4 and TPPA1 channels in health, and rescues the impaired ACh-induced vasorelaxation to exert anti-colitic action.

2023-11-06,37917619,Pharmacological induction of translational readthrough of nonsense mutations in the retinoblastoma (RB1) gene.,"The retinoblastoma protein (Rb) is encoded by the RB1 tumor suppressor gene. Inactivation of RB1 by inherited or somatic mutation occurs in retinoblastoma and various other types of tumors. A significant fraction (25.9%) of somatic RB1 mutations are nonsense substitutions leading to a premature termination codon (PTC) in the RB1 coding sequence and expression of truncated inactive Rb protein. Here we show that aminoglycoside G418, a known translational readthrough inducer, can induce full-length Rb protein in SW1783 astrocytoma cells with endogenous R579X nonsense mutant RB1 as well as in MDA-MB-436 breast carcinoma cells transiently transfected with R251X, R320X, R579X or Q702X nonsense mutant RB1 cDNA. Readthrough was associated with increased RB1 mRNA levels in nonsense mutant RB1 cells. Induction of full-length Rb protein was potentiated by the cereblon E3 ligase modulator CC-90009. These results suggest that pharmacological induction of translational readthrough could be a feasible strategy for therapeutic targeting of tumors with nonsense mutant RB1.",no,yes,no,in vitro,effectiveness,,retinopathy,3
2023-11-06,37922158,Medium Depth Influences O2 Availability and Metabolism in Human RPE Cultures.,"Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) oxidative metabolism is critical for normal retinal function and is often studied in cell culture systems. Here, we show that conventional culture media volumes dramatically impact O2 availability, limiting oxidative metabolism. We suggest optimal conditions to ensure cultured RPE is in a normoxic environment permissive to oxidative metabolism.We altered the availability of O2 to human primary and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived RPE cultures directly via a hypoxia chamber or indirectly via the amount of medium over cells. We measured oxygen consumption rates (OCRs), glucose consumption, lactate production, 13C6-glucose and 13C5-glutamine flux, hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) stability, intracellular lipid droplets after a lipid challenge, transepithelial electrical resistance, cell morphology, and pigmentation.Medium volumes commonly employed during RPE culture limit diffusion of O2 to cells, triggering hypoxia, activating HIF-1α, limiting OCR, and dramatically altering cell metabolism, with only minor effects on typical markers of RPE health. Media volume effects on O2 availability decrease acetyl-CoA utilization, increase glycolysis and reductive carboxylation, and alter the size and number of intracellular lipid droplets under lipid-rich conditions.Despite having little impact on visible and typical markers of RPE culture health, media volume dramatically affects RPE physiology ""under the hood."" As RPE-centric diseases like age-related macular degeneration involve oxidative metabolism, RPE cultures need to be optimized to study such diseases. We provide guidelines for optimal RPE culture volumes that balance ample nutrient availability from larger media volumes with adequate O2 availability seen with smaller media volumes.",no,yes,no,in vitro,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinal disease,3
2023-11-07,37087043,TFOS Lifestyle: Impact of elective medications and procedures on the ocular surface.,"The word ""elective"" refers to medications and procedures undertaken by choice or with a lower grade of prioritization. Patients usually use elective medications or undergo elective procedures to treat pathologic conditions or for cosmetic enhancement, impacting their lifestyle positively and, thus, improving their quality of life. However, those interventions can affect the homeostasis of the tear film and ocular surface. Consequently, they generate signs and symptoms that could impair the patient's quality of life. This report describes the impact of elective topical and systemic medications and procedures on the ocular surface and the underlying mechanisms. Moreover, elective procedures performed for ocular diseases, cosmetic enhancement, and non-ophthalmic interventions, such as radiotherapy and bariatric surgery, are discussed. The report also evaluates significant anatomical and biological consequences of non-urgent interventions to the ocular surface, such as neuropathic and neurotrophic keratopathies. Besides that, it provides an overview of the prophylaxis and management of pathological conditions resulting from the studied interventions and suggests areas for future research. The report also contains a systematic review investigating the quality of life among people who have undergone small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE).

2023-11-07,37099129,Curcumin attenuates hydroxychloroquine-mediated apoptosis and oxidative stress via the inhibition of TRPM2 channel signalling pathways in a retinal pigment epithelium cell line.,"Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is used in the treatment of several diseases, such as malaria, Sjögren's disease, Covid-19, and rheumatoid arthritis. However, HCQ induces retinal pigment epithelium death via the excessive increase of cytosolic (cROS) and mitochondrial (mROS) free oxygen radical production. The transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) cation channel is stimulated by ADP-ribose (ADPR), cROS, and mROS, although it is inhibited by curcumin (CRC). We aimed to investigate the modulating action of CRC on HCQ-induced TRPM2 stimulation, cROS, mROS, apoptosis, and death in an adult retinal pigment epithelial 19 (ARPE19) cell line model.ARPE19 cells were divided into four groups: control (CNT), CRC (5 µM for 24 h), HCQ (60 µM for 48 h), and CRC + HCQ groups.The levels of cell death (propidium iodide positive cell numbers), apoptosis markers (caspases -3, -8, and -9), oxidative stress (cROS and mROS), mitochondria membrane depolarization, TRPM2 current density, and intracellular free Ca2+ and Zn2+ fluorescence intensity were upregulated in the HCQ group after stimulation with hydrogen peroxide and ADPR, but their levels were downregulated by treatments with CRC and TRPM2 blockers (ACA and carvacrol). The HCQ-induced decrease in retinal live cell count and cell viability was counteracted by treatment with CRC.HCQ-mediated overload Ca2+ influx and retinal oxidative toxicity were induced in an ARPE19 cell line through the stimulation of TRPM2, although they were attenuated by treatment with CRC. Hence, CRC may be a potential therapeutic antioxidant for TRPM2 activation and HCQ treatment-induced retinal oxidative injury and apoptosis.",no,yes,no,in vitro,"effectiveness, safety",,"retinopathy, retinal disease",3

Intestinal strictures and fistulas are common complications of CD with varying severity in their presentations. Modifications in oral diet or use of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) are common approaches to manage both stricturing and fistulizing disease, although supporting research evidence is generally limited. In the preoperative period, there is strong evidence that EEN can reduce surgical complications. Parenteral nutrition (PN) is often utilized in the management of enterocutaneous fistulas, given that oral diet and EEN may potentially increase output in proximal fistulas.

Methods: Diabetic rats and control animals were randomly assigned to receive MG132 or vehicle for 24 weeks, and human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) were incubated with normal or high glucose with or without MG132. 26S proteasome activity in the rat retinas or cultured HRECs was measured using Suc-LLVY-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin. NADPH-quinone oxidoreduc-tase (NQO1), heme oxygenase (HO)-1, kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and Nrf2 were examined by Western blotting and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Cell apoptosis is measured through flow cytometry assay, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and retinal vascular leakage were assayed using CM-H2DCFDA fluorescent probes and Evans blue, respectively. Results: MG132 significantly inhibited the activation of 26S proteasome induced by diabetes or elevated glucose, and subsequently increased the expression of Nrf2, NQO1, and HO-1, and further reduced ROS accumulation. These changes were associated with a decrease of diabetes-induced retinal vascular leakage and retinal capillary cell apoptosis. Conclusions: MG132 decreases diabetes-induced 26S proteasome activation and exerts protective effects against retinal microvascular dysfunction in diabetic rats in association with the alleviation of retinal oxidative stress mediated by Nrf2.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,retinopathy,3

We aimed to generate and characterize a mouse model with the p.Arg195Leu mutation previously described in patients. Heterozygous (Prph2WT/KI) and homozygous (Prph2KI/KI) mice were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to introduce the p.Arg195Leu mutation. Retinal function was assessed by electroretinography and optomotor tests at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 20 months of age. The structural integrity of the retinas was evaluated at the same ages using optical coherence tomography. Immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy images of the retina were also analyzed. Genetic sequencing confirmed that both Prph2WT/KI and Prph2KI/KI mice presented the p.Arg195Leu mutation. A progressive loss of retinal function was found in both mutant groups, with significantly reduced visual acuity from 3 months of age in Prph2KI/KI mice and from 6 months of age in Prph2WT/KI mice. Decreased amplitudes in the electroretinography responses were observed from 1 month of age in Prph2KI/KI mice and from 6 months of age in Prph2WT/KI mice. Morphological analysis of the retinas correlated with functional findings, showing a progressive decrease in retinal thickness of mutant mice, with earlier and more severe changes in the homozygous mutant mice. We corroborated the alteration of the outer segment structure, and we found changes in the synaptic connectivity in the outer plexiform layer as well as gliosis and signs of microglial activation. The new Prph2WT/KI and Prph2KI/KI murine models show a pattern of retinal degeneration similar to that described in human patients with central areolar choroidal dystrophy and appear to be good models to study the mechanisms involved in the onset and progression of the disease, as well as to test the efficacy of new therapeutic strategies.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinal disease,3

Systemic and visual recovery was attained following corticosteroid therapy.A 27-year-old lady presented with painless blurring of vision in both eyes for 2 weeks following hyaluronic acid breast filler injections by a non-medical practitioner. She was initially admitted to the medical ward for diffuse alveolar haemorrhage and altered sensorium. The presenting visual acuity was counting fingers in both eyes. Bilateral dilated fundus examination showed hyperaemic discs, concentric rim of retinal whitening around macula with patches of polygonal-shaped retinal whitening, generalised cotton-wool spots, tortuous veins, and flame-shaped haemorrhages. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) macula revealed hyper-reflective bands at the inner nuclear layer (INL). Fluorescein angiography demonstrated hot discs, delayed arm-to-retina time, arterial filling, and arterio-venous transit time with staining of the vessels at the posterior pole. She was managed with a tapering dose of systemic corticosteroids. The visual acuity improved to 6/12 over 8 weeks with significant anatomical and functional improvement. Dilated fundus examination showed resolution of initial funduscopy findings. The hyper-reflective bands on the OCT had resolved with subsequent thinning of the INL and disorganisation of retinal inner layers.Filler injections are in increasing demand and are frequently being performed by non-medical practitioners. Visual loss from non-facial HA fillers is rare. Inadvertent entry of HA into a blood vessel may potentially cause systemic and sight-threatening ocular complications.

The representative mouse model lacking the central enzyme of this pathway, multifunctional protein 2 (Mfp2-/-), also show early-onset retinal decay and cell-autonomous retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) degeneration, accompanied by reduced plasma and retinal DHA levels. In this study, we investigated whether DHA supplementation can rescue the retinal degeneration of Mfp2-/- mice.Mfp2+/- breeding pairs and their offspring were fed a 0.12% DHA or control diet during gestation and lactation and until sacrifice. Offspring were analyzed for retinal function via electroretinograms and for lipid composition of neural retina and plasma with lipidome analysis and gas chromatography, respectively, and histologically using retinal sections and RPE flatmounts at the ages of 4, 8, and 16 weeks.DHA supplementation to Mfp2-/- mice restored retinal DHA levels and prevented photoreceptor shortening, death, and impaired functioning until 8 weeks. In addition, rescue of retinal DHA levels temporarily improved the ability of the RPE to phagocytose outer segments and delayed the RPE dedifferentiation. However, despite the initial rescue of retinal integrity, DHA supplementation could not prevent retinal degeneration at 16 weeks.We reveal that the shortage of a systemic supply of DHA is pivotal for the early retinal degeneration in Mfp2-/- mice.

PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, ProQuest, EBSCOHost, CENTRAL, clinicaltrials.gov, and Google Scholar were searched for articles reporting MMO in glaucoma patients. The primary outcome was the prevalence of MMO, while secondary outcomes included the comparison between MMO and non-MMO in terms of patients' characteristics (age, gender), glaucoma stage, and ocular parameters (axial length (AL), intraocular pressure, mean deviation, spherical equivalent). Data are reported as mean difference (MD) or log odds ratio (logOR) along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous and dichotomous outcomes, respectively. The quality of included studies was assessed using the NIH tool, and the certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE framework. Ten studies (2128 eyes) were included, revealing an overall prevalence rate of MMO of 8% (95%CI: 5-12%). When compared to non-MMO group, MMO was associated with lower age (MD = -5.91; 95%CI: -6.02: -5.20), greater risk of advanced glaucoma stage (LogOR=1.41; 95%CI: 0.72: 2.09), and lower mean deviation of the visual field (MD = -5.00; 95%CI: -7.01: -2.99).

An effective retinal organoid induction scheme for inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway was selected for further experiments, and the established cell line chHES-406 was demonstrated to be heterozygous for RHO c.512C>T, with a normal karyotype and pluripotency potential. Furthermore, the development of chHES-406 organoids may be delayed, and apoptosis detection and co-localization revealed that chHES-406 organoids had more apoptotic cells than chHES-90 in the outer nuclear layer (ONL), mutant RHO protein was mislocalized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and stress-related and apoptotic gene expression increased.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential therapeutic targets, efficacy, and safety of FHT in the treatment of Sjogren's syndrome (SS). The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was used to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in SS. Further, gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed to explore the potential biological functions of the DEGs. Subsequently, an FHT-herb-active compound-target network was constructed to identify the relationship between the active compounds in FHT and the related targets. Then, enrichment analysis involving the DEGs and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis were performed to analyze the biological functions of potential targets and screen hub genes. Further, molecular docking was employed to verify the binding affinity between the active compounds and the hub targets, and in vivo experiments involving NOD/LtJ mice were conducted to verify the therapeutic effects of FHT on SS-like symptoms. Finally, inhibition of PIK3CK/Akt pathway by FHT was validated by WB and rt-qPCR. A total of 1836 DEGs were identified in SS based on the GSE159574 dataset, and 114 targets of the active compounds in FHT were screened. Further, via network pharmacology analysis and molecular docking, six active compounds and five hub targets were obtained, and enrichment analysis showed that the anti-SS effect of FHT was predominantly associated with immune cells, such as T cells and neutrophils. In vivo, FHT effectively reduced lymphocyte infiltration foci, increased saliva flow rate, and inhibited increases in the levels of SS-related autoantibodies (anti-SSA and anti-SSB). Furthermore, the biosafety of FHT was verified via the serological examination of liver and kidney function. WB and rt-qPCR analysis confirmed that FHT could inhibit the expression of PIK3CG and the activation of PIK3CG/Akt pathway. Via network pharmacological analysis, molecular docking, and in vivo verification, we demonstrated the multicomponent and multitarget characteristics of FHT in SS treatment, thereby providing novel insights into the pathogenesis of SS and the therapeutic targets of FHT for SS.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety",,sjogren's syndrome,3

Herein, we present a novel microgel oral delivery system, loaded with liposome nanoparticles (Li NPs) containing a natural anti-inflammatory compound genistein (Gen) into alginate microgels, thereby achieving the targeted release of Gen in the colonic region and ameliorating UC symptoms. Initially, Gen was loaded into phosphatidylserine (PS)-functionalized Li NPs to form Gen@Li NPs with an average size of 245.9 ± 9.6 nm. In vitro assessments confirmed that Gen@Li NPs efficiently targeted macrophages and facilitated the internalization of Gen into cells. To prevent rapid degradation in the harsh gastrointestinal tract, Gen@Li NPs were further encapsulated into alginate microgels through electric spraying technology, forming Gen@Li microgels. In vivo distribution tests demonstrated that Gen@Li microgels possessed long-term retention in the colon and gradual release characteristics compared to Gen@Li NPs. Furthermore, in vivo experiments confirmed that Gen@Li microgels significantly alleviated UC symptoms in mice induced by dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS) mainly through reducing the expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) and promoting colonic mucosal barrier repair through upregulation of mucosal protein expression.

2023-11-09,37883687,Phenolics from ,"The increasing incidence of colitis and the side effects of its therapeutic drugs have led to the search for compounds of natural origin, including phenolics, as new treatments for colitis. In this study, the potential mechanism of Dendrobium officinale leaf phenolics (DOP) on the relief of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis was explored. The results showed that DOP treatment for 36 days reduced the symptoms of colitis caused by DSS, including reduction of the disease activity index and alleviation of colonic tissue damage. In addition, DOP downregulated the expression of key proteins of the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway and reduced the production of inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, DOP could enhance the expression of tight junction proteins including ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-1 to restore intestinal mucosal barrier function. DOP also effectively regulates disordered intestinal flora and enhances the production of short-chain fatty acids, which is also beneficial in modulating gut internal environmental homeostasis, inhibiting inflammation, and restoring the intestinal barrier. These findings indicated that DOP can ameliorate DSS-induced chronic colitis by regulating gut microbiota, intestinal barrier, and inflammation, and it is a promising ingredient from D. officinale.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3
2023-11-09,37903272,Dysregulated CD200-CD200R signaling in early diabetes modulates microglia-mediated retinopathy.,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a neurovascular complication of diabetes. Recent investigations have suggested that early degeneration of the neuroretina may occur prior to the appearance of microvascular changes; however, the mechanisms underlying this neurodegeneration have been elusive. Microglia are the predominant resident immune cell in the retina and adopt dynamic roles in disease. Here, we show that ablation of retinal microglia ameliorates visual dysfunction and neurodegeneration in a type I diabetes mouse model. We also provide evidence of enhanced microglial contact and engulfment of amacrine cells, ultrastructural modifications, and transcriptome changes that drive inflammation and phagocytosis. We show that CD200-CD200R signaling between amacrine cells and microglia is dysregulated during early DR and that targeting CD200R can attenuate high glucose-induced inflammation and phagocytosis in cultured microglia. Last, we demonstrate that targeting CD200R in vivo can prevent visual dysfunction, microglia activation, and retinal inflammation in the diabetic mouse. These studies provide a molecular framework for the pivotal role that microglia play in early DR pathogenesis and identify a potential immunotherapeutic target for treating DR in patients.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinopathy,3
2023-11-09,37935821,Co-cultivation of primary porcine RPE cells and neuroretina induces inflammation: a potential inflammatory AMD-model.,"One common aspect in the pathology of many retinal diseases like age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the death of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. RPE cells are essential for photoreceptor survival as they recycle and remove compounds of the visual cycle and secrete protective cytokines. Studying RPE cells is crucial to improve our understanding of retinal pathologies, yet only a few retinal ex vivo models include them or do so only indirectly. Besides the positive effects in indirect co-cultivation models, also a slight inflammation was observed. In this study we developed an ex vivo model consisting of a primary porcine RPE monolayer directly co-cultured with porcine retinal organ cultures, to investigate and simulate inflammatory retinal diseases, such as (dry) AMD. The direct co-cultivation resulted in immune reactivity (enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines e.g., IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8) and cell death. These effects were evaluated for the retinal explant as well as for the RPE-monolayer to further understand the complex interactions between these two compartments. Taken together, this ex vivo model can be used to study inflammatory retinal diseases like AMD as well as the rejection observed after RPE-transplantation.",no,yes,no,in vitro,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinal disease,3

In this case report, the foveal cone integrity in a tamoxifen-treated patient who complained of a small central scotoma in the left eye while reading was examined using high resolution adaptive optics imaging.Both eyes of a 54-year-old Caucasian, non-hispanic female who had been treated with tamoxifen for 1.5 years were examined using various imaging modalities including fundus photography, fundus autofluorescence, fluorescein angiography, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, and adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy. Clinical spectral-domain optical coherence tomography showed a very small disruption to the photoreceptor layer at the fovea in the left eye only. However, adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy imaging revealed foveal cone loss in both eyes, but to a lesser extent in the right eye. Inner retinal changes were not observed in either eye.The area of cone loss was similar in size to a single newsprint letter when projected onto the retina, matching the patient's description of a scotoma in the left eye. Given the isolated loss of foveal cone photoreceptors with the absence of previously reported inner retinal and vascular changes, our results may indicate the earliest retinal changes associated with tamoxifen retinopathy.",no,yes,no,other,"safety, diagnostic",,retinal disease,3
2023-11-09,37936359,[Experimental study on the therapeutic effect and mechanism of erlotinib on non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy].,"Objective: To investigate the therapeutic effect and mechanism of erlotinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, on non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR). Methods: An experimental research was conducted. Human retinal Müller cells (RMC) were MIO-M1 cells from Moorfields Ophthalmology Hospital and the Institute of Ophthalmology at London University College. MIO-M1 cells were divided into normal, hypertonic, high glucose, high glucose+dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), high glucose+erlotinib 0.5 mmol/L, high glucose+erlotinib 1 mmol/L, and high glucose+erlotinib 2 mmol/L groups using a random number table method. Detection of the effect of erlotinib on the proliferation of MIO-M1 cells under high glucose conditions was performed by 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) method. Western blotting (WB) was used to detect the effect of erlotinib on the activation markers of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and glutamine synthetase (GS) protein levels in MIO-M1 cells under high glucose conditions. WB was used to detect the effect of erlotinib on the protein levels of nerve growth factor receptor (p75NTR), vimentin, and cell retinol binding protein (CRALBP) in RMC under high glucose conditions. MIO-M1 cells were divided into normal group, high glucose group, high glucose+DMSO group, and high glucose+erlotinib (1 mmol/L) group using random number table method. The effect of erlotinib on EGFR nuclear translocation under high glucose conditions was detected by cell immunofluorescence staining. Immunoprecipitation was used to detect the effect of erlotinib on the interaction between EGFR and transcription intermediate factor 2 (TIF2) in MIO-M1 cells under high glucose conditions. MIO-M1 cells were randomly divided into normal group, high glucose group, high glucose+DMSO group, high glucose+Myc-DDK empty body group, high glucose+erlotinib group, high glucose+erlotinib+human doublet protein group, high glucose+erlotinib+TIF2 plasmid group, and high glucose+erlotinib+human doublet protein+TIF2 plasmid group. Cell immunofluorescence staining was used to detect the effect of erlotinib on the binding of EGFR and TIF2 in MIO-M1 cells under high glucose conditions through the EGFR/TIF2 axis. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the regulatory effect of EGFR and TIF2 binding on cyclin D1 transcription in MIO-M1 cells under high glucose conditions. The mouse model of diabetes retinopathy (DR) was constructed and divided into normal group, DR group, DR+DMSO group, DR+erlotinib 0.25 mg·kg-1·d-1 group, DR+erlotinib 0.5 mg·kg-1·d-1 group and DR+erlotinib 1 mg·kg-1·d-1 group. 25 mice in total, 5 in each group. Tissue immunofluorescence staining was used to detect the expression of RMC activation marker GFAP. The FITC-dextran injection experiment was used to detect the effect of erlotinib on retinal vascular leakage in a murine DR model. Results: Compared with the normal group (32.4%±3.0%), the proportion of EdU positive cells in RMC in the high glucose group (59.2%±3.8%) increased (P<0.001). Compared with the high glucose group (59.2%±3.8%), the proportion of EdU positive cells in the high glucose+1 mmol/L erlotinib group (37.6%±4.4%) decreased (P<0.001). Compared with the normal group, the expression of GFAP in RMC in the high glucose group increased (1 in the normal group, 2.27±0.11 in the high glucose group, P<0.001), while the expression of GS decreased (1 in the normal group, 0.32±0.03 in the high glucose group, P<0.001). 1 mmol/L erlotinib treatment reduced the expression of GFAP in RMC under high glucose conditions (1.32±0.13 and 2.27±0.11, respectively; P<0.001), and increased the expression of GS (0.71±0.06 and 0.32±0.03, respectively; P<0.001). The colocalization of EGFR and DAPI in RMC of the high glucose+1 mmol/L erlotinib group was lower than that of the high glucose group (52.2%±4.1% and 76.4%±5.7%, respectively; P<0.001). The expression of TIF2 or EGFR both increased while using EGF or TIF2 antibodies to precipitate TIF2 or EGFR under high glucose conditions compared to the normal group (1 in the normal group, 2.27±0.20 in the high glucose group, 2.17±0.21 in the EGFR, all P<0.05). And the expression of TIF2 (1.38±0.10) or EGFR (1.32±0.13) in the high glucose+erlotinib group was lower than that in the high glucose group (2.27±0.20) and the high glucose group (2.17±0.21) (all P<0.05). The colocalization of EGFR and TIF2 (17.2%±3.9%) and the mRNA level of Cyclin D1 (1.32±0.16) in the RMC of the high glucose+erlotinib group were lower than those in the high glucose group (54.6%±3.7% of EGFR and TIF2 colocalization ratio, 2.58±0.19 of Cyclin D1 mRNA level,all P<0.05). The high glucose+erlotinib+AREG (EGFR agonist) group, high glucose+erlotinib+Myc DDK-TIF2 plasmid group and high sugar+erlotinib+AREG+Myc-DDK-TIF2 plasmid group EGFR colocalization with TIF2 (colocalization ratios 24.1%±1.9%, 26.0%±2.3%, 35.3%±2.5%) and TIF2 mRNA levels (1.71±0.16, 1.72±0.18, 2.20±0.18). Compared with the high glucose+erlotinib group, The increases were statistically significant (all P<0.05). Compared to the normal group, the expression of GFAP in mouse retina tissue was increased in the DR group (1 in the normal group, 3.07±0.19 in the DR group, P<0.001), and 0.5 mg·kg-1·d-1 erlotinib (1.73±0.30) significantly reduced the expression of GFAP in the retina of DR group mice (P<0.05). Compared to the normal group (3.97±0.47), the DR group (23.13±2.15) showed an increase in fluorescein leakage, while the DR+erlotinib group (11.66±1.45) showed a significant decrease in leakage compared to the DR group (all P<0.05). Conclusions: Erlotinib inhibits the proliferation and activation of RMC induced by high glucose, inhibits the entry of EGFR into the nucleus, inhibits the binding of EGFR to TIF2 in RMC, and reduces the transcription of Cyclin D1 in RMC by inhibiting the interaction between EGFR and TIF2. At the same time, erlotinib inhibits the proliferation and activation of RMC in the mouse DR model, ameliorating retinal vascular leakage in mice. These results suggest that erlotinib inhibits the activation and proliferation of RMC by downregulating the EGFR/TIF2/Cyclin D1 pathway under high glucose conditions, thereby alleviating the progression of NPDR.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinopathy,3
2023-11-09,37936360,[Health economic evaluation of telemedicine diabetic retinopathy examination using a non-mydriatic fundus camera in China].,"Objective: To perform a health economic evaluation of telemedicine diabetic retinopathy (DR) examination with a non-mydriatic fundus camera in China and to investigate the optimal examination interval. Methods: Based on 18 peer-reviewed articles related to epidemiology, clinical trial, and health economic evaluation of DR, surveys from 9 ophthalmologists in 3 tertiary hospitals in China, price lists for medical services in each province, and the negotiated price in 2021, a Markov model was conducted to evaluate the cost utility of telemedicine eye examination for diabetes mellitus patients aged 45 and older from the health system perspective. Separate analyses were performed for no examination and for examination intervals of every 1 to 5 years to predict the lifetime health gain, including cumulative days of blindness, cumulative life years, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs for unilateral and bilateral direct medication with a 3.5% discount rate. Results: The cumulative days of blindness in the absence of a DR screening were 2 375.00 days, and ranged from 701.00 to 738.00 days for five different DR screening interval programs. The cumulative life years for no screening and five DR screening programs ranged from 27.120 34 to 28.005 00 years, with QALYs ranging from 9.502 96 to 9.875 02. The direct medication costs in the absence of a DR screening program were 72 785.00 yuan for both unilateral and bilateral scenarios. For the five DR screening intervals, the direct medication costs ranged from 52 065.00 to 52 408.00 yuan for unilateral and 79 100.00 to 79 603.00 yuan for bilateral. Comparing the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios between the DR screening intervals and no screening, the 1-to 5-year intervals were dominant in the unilateral scenario (between -56 368.54 and -55 523.75 yuan/QALY). In the bilateral scenario, the ratios ranged from 17 469.07 to 18 325.15 yuan/QALY. Using a willingness-to-pay threshold equal to the per capita GDP (80 976 yuan/QALY), the 1-year DR screening interval had an 85.9% probability of being cost-effective and a 55.2% probability of being dominant in the unilateral scenario. In the bilateral scenario, the 2-year interval held a 61.4% probability of being cost-effective. Conclusions: Analyses on the remote fundus consultation in diabetic patients and health economics based on the Markov model indicate that telemedicine DR examination through a non-mydriatic fundus camera can be effectively employed for diabetes mellitus patients in China. DR examination every two years is recommended for general diabetic patients, and DR examination every year may be chosen in developed areas.",no,yes,no,other,effectiveness,,retinopathy,3
2023-11-10,37233978,Protein kinase C delta mediates Pasireotide effects in an ACTH-secreting pituitary tumor cell line.,"Clinical control of corticotroph tumors is difficult to achieve since they usually persist or relapse after surgery. Pasireotide is approved to treat patients with Cushing's disease for whom surgical therapy is not an option. However, Pasireotide seems to be effective only in a sub-set of patients, highlighting the importance to find a response marker to this approach. Recent studies demonstrated that the delta isoform of protein kinase C (PRKCD) controls viability and cell cycle progression of an in vitro model of ACTH-secreting pituitary tumor, the AtT-20/D16v-F2 cells. This study aims at exploring the possible PRKCD role in mediating Pasireotide effects.It was assessed cell viability, POMC expression and ACTH secretion in AtT20/D16v-F2 cells over- or under-expressing PRKCD.We found that Pasireotide significantly reduces AtT20/D16v-F2 cell viability, POMC expression and ACTH secretion. In addition, Pasireotide reduces miR-26a expression. PRKCD silencing decreases AtT20/D16v-F2 cell sensitivity to Pasireotide treatment; on the contrary, PRKCD overexpression increases the inhibitory effects of Pasireotide on cell viability and ACTH secretion.Our results provide new insights into potential PRKCD contribution in Pasireotide mechanism of action and suggest that PRKCD might be a possible marker of therapeutic response in ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors.",no,yes,no,in vitro,"effectiveness, biomarker",,Cushing's disease,3

The persistent, severe and serious systemic complications of Sjögren's are poorly understood and often unappreciated, resulting in significant morbidity and treatment burden. This study aimed to explore the experiences of those living with Sjögren's, specifically access to healthcare and attitude towards telemedicine. Additionally, we sought to collect information regarding the impact of the pandemic on their quality of life (QoL).One hundred and ninety-four individuals attended an Irish Sjögren's Webinar. Attendees were invited to participate in two online surveys after the webinar. The first survey gathered information related to demographics, disease and experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. A combination of bespoke items and validated questionnaires (EULAR Sjögren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index [ESSPRI], COVID-19 Impact on Quality of Life [COV19-QoL]) was used. The second survey consisted of a shortened Telehealth Usability Questionnaire. Both were prepared in collaboration with a patient advocate.Survey 1: n = 76; response rate = 39.2%. Thirty-one respondents (41.4%) to survey 1 reported a delay of ≥5 years between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis. Dry mouth was the most common symptom experienced (76.8%, n = 63), followed by dry eye (74.4%, n = 61), fatigue (57.3%, n = 47) and joint pain (53.7%, n = 44), but a range of other symptoms were also reported. COV19-QoL results indicated that the pandemic had a detrimental effect on participants' overall QoL (4.0 ± 1.0) and physical health (4.0 ± 0.8) in particular. COV19-QoL and ESSPRI scores were moderately correlated (0.36, p = .002). Over 70% of respondents had a medical appointment cancelled, delayed or rescheduled (n = 60). Survey 2: n = 57; response rate = 29.4%. Those that had interacted with telemedicine reported largely positive experiences with the virtual model.Clinicians should be aware of the range of symptoms experienced by patients with Sjögren's beyond those of sicca (dry eye and dry mouth) and fatigue. COVID-19 has negatively influenced the self-reported health and well-being of those with Sjögren's, particularly those with higher symptom scores. It is vital that optimised telemedicine models are implemented to ensure continuity in the provision of healthcare for those with chronic illness such as Sjögren's and in preparation for possible future pandemics.A group of people living with Sjögren's co-designed the structure and content of the webinar where the survey was shared. A public and patient involvement (PPI) contributor also collaborated in the selection of questionnaires used in the study, ensuring that the questions asked would best reflect the priorities of patients.

2023-11-10,37515676,The interaction of bile acids and gut inflammation influences the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.,"Bile acids (BA) are amphipathic molecules originating from cholesterol in the liver and from microbiota-driven biotransformation in the colon. In the gut, BA play a key role in fat digestion and absorption and act as potent signaling molecules on the nuclear farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and membrane-associated G protein-coupled BA receptor-1 (GPBAR-1). BA are, therefore, involved in the maintenance of gut barrier integrity, gene expression, metabolic homeostasis, and microbiota profile and function. Disturbed BA homeostasis can activate pro-inflammatory pathways in the gut, while inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) can induce gut dysbiosis and qualitative and/or quantitative changes of the BA pool. These factors contribute to impaired repair capacity of the mucosal barrier, due to chronic inflammation. A better understanding of BA-dependent mechanisms paves the way to innovative therapeutic tools by administering hydrophilic BA and FXR agonists and manipulating gut microbiota with probiotics and prebiotics.

While advances in autologous photoreceptor cell manufacturing have been encouraging, development of technologies capable of efficiently delivering genome editing reagents to stem cells using current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) are needed. Gene editing reagents were delivered to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using a Zephyr microfluidic transfection platform (CellFE).

The emergence of CRISPR-Cas9 has significantly advanced targeted and efficient genome editing. Although CRISPR-Cas9 has demonstrated promising potential applications in various genetic disorders, it faces limitations in simultaneously targeting multiple genes. Novel CRISPR systems, such as Cas12 and Cas13, have been developed to overcome these challenges, enabling multiplexing and providing unique advantages. Cas13, in particular, targets mRNA instead of genomic DNA, permitting precise gene expression control and mitigating off-target effects. This review investigates the potential of Cas12 and Cas13 in ocular gene therapy applications, such as suppression of inflammation and cell death. In addition, the capabilities of Cas12 and Cas13 are explored in addressing potential targets related with disease mechanisms such as aberrant isoforms, mitochondrial genes, cis-regulatory sequences, modifier genes, and long non-coding RNAs. Anatomical accessibility and relative immune privilege of the eye provide an ideal organ system for evaluating these novel techniques' efficacy and safety. By targeting multiple genes concurrently, CRISPR-Cas12 and Cas13 systems hold promise for treating a range of ocular disorders, including glaucoma, retinal dystrophies, and age-related macular degeneration. Nonetheless, additional refinement is required to ascertain the safety and efficacy of these approaches in ocular disease treatments.

Current therapeutic drugs are ineffective for some patients with severe side effects, and ginsenoside-Rg1 (GRg1) has been shown to protect against DR and may serve as a new potential drug for DR. This study aimed to confirm the protective effect of GRg1 against DR and its molecular mechanism.Human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (hRMECs) and rats were used to construct DR models in vitro and in vivo. Cell proliferation was detected by BrdU assays, the cell cycle was detected by flow cytometry, and TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β levels were detected by ELISA. qRT‒PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the expression of related genes and proteins, and angiogenesis assays were used to assess angiogenesis. RIP and RNA pull down assays were used to determine the relationship between miR-216a-5p and TLR4; retinal structure and changes were observed by HE staining and retinal digestive spread assays.GRg1 effectively inhibited HG-induced hRMEC proliferation, cell cycle progression and angiogenesis and reduced the levels of intracellular inflammatory cytokines and growth factors. HG downregulated the expression of miR-216a-5p and upregulated the expression of TLR4/NF-kB signaling pathway-related proteins. Importantly, GRg1 inhibited TLR4/NF-kB signaling pathway activation by upregulating miR-216a-5p, thereby inhibiting HG-induced cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, angiogenesis, and the production of inflammatory cytokines and growth factors.

Compound w2 demonstrated acceptable pharmacokinetic characteristics and alleviated the severity of acute ulcerative colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, w2 exerted better therapeutic effects on ulcerative colitis than hDHODH inhibitor vidofludimus and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor tofacitinib.

2023-11-10,37938936,Diabetes-Associated Hyperglycemia Causes Rapid-Onset Ocular Surface Damage.,"The metabolic alterations due to chronic hyperglycemia are well-known to cause diabetes-associated complications. Short-term hyperglycemia has also been shown to cause many acute changes, including hemodynamic alterations and osmotic, oxidative, and inflammatory stress. The present study was designed to investigate whether diabetes-associated hyperglycemia can cause rapid-onset detrimental effects on the tear film, goblet cells, and glycocalyx and can lead to activation of an inflammatory cascade or cellular stress response in the cornea.Mouse models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes were used. Tear film volume, goblet cell number, and corneal glycocalyx area were measured on days 7, 14, and 28 after the onset of hyperglycemia. Transcriptome analysis was performed to quantify changes in 248 transcripts of genes involved in inflammatory, apoptotic, and stress response pathways.Our data demonstrate that type 1 and type 2 diabetes-associated hyperglycemia caused a significant decrease in the tear film volume, goblet cell number, and corneal glycocalyx area. The decrease in tear film and goblet cell number was noted as early as 7 days after onset of hyperglycemia. The severity of ocular surface injury was significantly more in type 1 compared to type 2 diabetes. Diabetes mellitus also caused an increase in transcripts of genes involved in the inflammatory, apoptotic, and cellular stress response pathways.The results of the present study demonstrate that diabetes-associated hyperglycemia causes rapid-onset damage to the ocular surface. Thus, short-term hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes mellitus may also play an important role in causing ocular surface injury and dry eye.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,dry eye,3
2023-11-13,35468007,Quercetin: an effective polyphenol in alleviating diabetes and diabetic complications.,"Various studies, especially in recent years, have shown that quercetin has beneficial therapeutic effects in various human diseases, including diabetes. Quercetin has significant anti-diabetic effects and may be helpful in lowering blood sugar and increasing insulin sensitivity. Quercetin appears to affect many factors and signaling pathways involved in insulin resistance and the pathogenesis of type 2 of diabetes. TNFα, NFKB, AMPK, AKT, and NRF2 are among the factors that are affected by quercetin. In addition, quercetin can be effective in preventing and ameliorating the diabetic complications, including diabetic nephropathy, cardiovascular complications, neuropathy, delayed wound healing, and retinopathy, and affects the key mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of these complications. These positive effects of quercetin may be related to its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. In this article, after a brief review of the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, we will review the latest findings on the anti-diabetic effects of quercetin with a molecular perspective. Then we will review the effects of quercetin on the key mechanisms of pathogenesis of diabetes complications including nephropathy, cardiovascular complications, neuropathy, delayed wound healing, and retinopathy.

Twenty cohort respondents participated in additional telephone interviews.The online survey was comprised of questions concerning demographics, self-reported vision, genetic testing, information preferences, health care experiences, treatment goals, and disease impact on daily life. Recruitment occurred through Fighting Blindness Canada's community database. Survey dissemination also occurred via social media and not-for-profit stakeholder outreach. Subsequent to survey completion, a subset of respondents participated in semistructured telephone interviews to further elucidate illness experience.Respondents identified having 1 of more than 14 IRDs, with 72% specifying retinitis pigmentosa. Sixty-eight percent reported being legally blind, and more than 85% self-reported moderate to low vision or worse. IRDs impacted daily functioning, with 53% of respondents indicating that they affected employment or education. Psychological challenges were evident, with more than 70% worried about coping with daily life and more than 60% indicating fear and stress. Qualitative data described hopelessness around suitable work, loss of independence, and challenges with social interaction. Sixty-five percent reported a negative impact on family life. Many had not accessed social support services because of a lack of perceived need, awareness, or availability.Canadian patients with IRDs report moderate to severe visual impairment, and both patients and their families describe an impact on psychosocial well-being and functioning during daily activities.

2023-11-13,37699444,Immunoregulation mechanism of VEGF signaling pathway inhibitors and its efficacy on the kidney.,"Angiogenesis and immunosuppression are closely related pathophysiologic processes. Widely prescribed in malignant tumor and proliferative retinal lesions, VEGF signaling pathway inhibitors may cause hypertension and renal injury in some patients, presenting with proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome, renal failure and thrombotic microangiopathy. VEGF signaling pathway inhibitors block the action of both VEGF-A and VEGF-C. However, VEGF-A and VEGF-C produced by podocytes are vital to maintain the physiological function of glomerular endothelial cells and podocytes. There is still no effective treatment for kidney disease associated with VEGF signaling pathway inhibitors and some patients have progressive renal failure even after withdrawal of the drug. Recent studies reveal that blocking of VEGF-A and VEGF-C can activate CD4 +and CD8+ T cells, augment antigen-presenting function of dendritic cells, enhance cytotoxicity of macrophages and initiate complement cascade activation. VEGF and VEGFR are expressed in immune cells, which are involved in the immunosuppression and cross-talk among immune cells. This review summarizes the expression and function of VEGF-A and VEGF-C in the kidney. The current immunoregulation mechanisms of VEGF signaling pathway inhibitors are reviewed.

2023-11-13,37742700,Glaucoma: now and beyond.,"The glaucomas are a group of conditions leading to irreversible sight loss and characterised by progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells. Although not always elevated, intraocular pressure is the only modifiable risk factor demonstrated by large clinical trials. It remains the leading cause of irreversible blindness, but timely treatment to lower intraocular pressure is effective at slowing the rate of vision loss from glaucoma. Methods for lowering intraocular pressure include laser treatments, topical medications, and surgery. Although modern surgical innovations aim to be less invasive, many have been introduced with little supporting evidence from randomised controlled trials. Many cases remain undiagnosed until the advanced stages of disease due to the limitations of screening and poor access to opportunistic case finding. Future research aims to generate evidence for intraocular pressure-independent neuroprotective treatments, personalised treatment through genetic risk profiling, and exploration of potential advanced cellular and gene therapies.",no,yes,no,other,"effectiveness, safety",,retinal disease,3
2023-11-13,37768347,Production of recombinant human long-acting IL-18 binding protein: inhibitory effect on ulcerative colitis in mice.,"Interleukin-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) is a natural IL-18 inhibitor in vivo, which can effectively neutralize IL-18 and inhibit the inflammatory signaling pathway induced by IL-18, thus playing an anti-inflammatory role. Traditional production methods primarily rely on eukaryotic animal cell expression systems, which often entail complex processes, lower yields, and increase production costs. In this study, we present a novel approach for expressing IL-18BP fusion protein using the Escherichia coli (E. coli) system. The N-terminal segment of IL-18BP was fused with the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) tag, enabling soluble expression, while the C-terminal segment was fused with the human IgG1 Fc fragment to prolong its in vivo lifespan. Through screening, we obtained a high-expression engineering strain from a single colony and developed optimized protocols for fermentation and purification of the recombinant SUMO-IL-18BP-Fc protein. The SUMO tag was subsequently cleaved using SUMO protease, and the purified recombinant human IL-18BP-Fc (rhIL-18BP-Fc) exhibited a purity exceeding 90% with a yield of 1 g per liter of bacterial solution. The biological activities and underlying mechanisms of rhIL-18BP-Fc were evaluated using cell lines and a mouse model. Our results demonstrated that rhIL-18BP-Fc effectively inhibited IL-18-stimulated IFN-γ production in KG-1a cells in vitro and ameliorated DSS-induced ulcerative colitis in mice. In conclusion, we successfully employed the SUMO fusion system to achieve high-level production, soluble expression, and prolonged activity of rhIL-18BP-Fc in E. coli. These findings lay the groundwork for future large-scale industrial production and pharmaceutical development of rhIL-18BP-Fc protein. KEY POINTS: • Effective expression, fermentation, and purification of bioactive rhIL-18BP-Fc protein in E. coli. • The rhIL-18BP-Fc protein has a great potential for the therapy of ulcerative colitis by inhibiting the expression of inflammatory factors.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety",,ulcerative colitis,3
2023-11-13,37772657,Conditional loss of Ube3d in the retinal pigment epithelium accelerates age-associated alterations in the retina of mice.,"Several studies have suggested a correlation between the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), with its phenotypic severity ranging from mild visual impairment to blindness, but the mechanism for UPS dysfunction contributing to disease progression is unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of ubiquitin protein ligase E3D (UBE3D) in aging and degeneration in mouse retina. Conditional knockout of Ube3d in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) of mice led to progressive and irregular fundus lesions, attenuation of the retinal vascular system, and age-associated deterioration of rod and cone responses. Simultaneously, RPE-specific Ube3d knockout mice also presented morphological changes similar to the histopathological characteristics of human AMD, in which a defective UPS led to RPE abnormalities such as phagocytosis or degradation of metabolites, the interaction with photoreceptor outer segment, and the transport of nutrients or waste products with choroidal capillaries via Bruch's membrane. Moreover, conditional loss of Ube3d resulted in aberrant molecular characterizations associated with the autophagy-lysosomal pathway, oxidative stress damage, and cell-cycle regulation, which are implicated in AMD pathology. Thus, our findings strengthen and expand the impact of UPS dysfunction on retinal pathophysiology during aging, indicating that genetic Ube3d deficiency in the RPE could lead to the abnormal formation of pigment deposits and secondary fundus alterations. © 2023 The Authors.

In this work, we propose a 3D vascularized stroma model to be used as in vitro platform for drug testing. A pullulan/dextran-based porous scaffold containing pre-patterned microchannels of 100 μm diameter is used for co-culturing of fibroblasts within the matrix pores and endothelial cells to form the lumen. Optical clearing of the constructs by hyperhydration allows for in-depth imaging of the model up to 1 mm by lightsheet and confocal microscopy. Our 3D vascularized stroma model allows for higher viability, metabolism and cytokines expression compared to a monocultured vascular model. Stroma-endothelium cross-talk is then investigated by exposing the system to pro and anti-angiogenic molecules. The results highlight the protective role played by fibroblasts on the vasculature, as demonstrated by decreased cytotoxicity, restoration of nitric oxide levels upon challenge, and sustained expression of endothelial markers CD31, vWF and VEGF. Our tissue model provides a 3D engineered platform for in vitro studies of stroma remodeling in angiogenesis-driven events, known to be a leading mechanism in diseased conditions, such as metastatic cancers, retinopathies and ischemia, and to investigate related potential therapies.",no,yes,no,in vitro,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinopathy,3
2023-11-13,37783334,Artesunate mitigates choroidal neovascularization and scar formation.,"Angiogenesis, although required during eye development, has a causative effect in many ocular diseases. Aberrant neovascularization contributes to the progression of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), a vision-threaten disease in aging Americans. Since increased amounts of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drives neovascularization during the pathogenesis of nAMD the standard of care are anti-VEGF therapies attempt to disrupt this vicious cycle. These current anti-VEGF therapies try to maintain vascular homeostasis while abating aberrant neovascularization but regrettably don't prevent fibrosis or scar formation. In addition, some patients demonstrate an incomplete response to anti-VEGF therapy as demonstrated by progressive vision loss. Here, we show choroidal endothelial cells (ChEC) incubated with artesunate demonstrated decreased migration and inflammatory and fibrotic factor expression, which corresponded with decreased sprouting in a choroid/retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) explant sprouting angiogenesis assay. To assess the efficacy of artesunate to curtail neovascularization in vivo, we utilized laser photocoagulation-induced rupture of the Bruch's membrane to induce choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Artesunate significantly inhibited CNV and the accompanying fibrotic scar, perhaps due in part to its ability to inhibit mononuclear phagocyte (MP) recruitment. Thus, artesunate shows promise in inhibiting both CNV and fibrosis.",no,yes,no,animal,effectiveness,,retinal disease,3

Uncontrolled chronic hyperglycaemia causes increased formation and accumulation of different oxidative and nitrosative stress markers, resulting in microvascular and macrovascular complications, which might seriously affect the quality of a patient's life. Conventional treatment strategies are confined to controlling blood glucose by regulating the insulin level and are not involved in attenuating the life-threatening complications of diabetes mellitus. Thus, there is an unmet need to develop a viable treatment strategy that could target the multi-etiological factors involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications. Stem cell therapy, a regenerative medicine approach, has been investigated in diabetic complications owing to their unique characteristic features of self-renewal, multilineage differentiation and regeneration potential.

Patients with MPSs display various signs and symptoms, such as retinopathy, which is also observed in patients with MPS II. Unfortunately, retinal disorders in MPS II are resistant to conventional intravenous enzyme-replacement therapy because the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) impedes drug penetration. In this study, we show that a fusion protein, designated pabinafusp alfa, consisting of an antihuman transferrin receptor antibody and iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS), crosses the BRB and reaches the retina in a murine model of MPS II. We found that retinal function, as assessed by electroretinography (ERG) in MPS II mice, deteriorated with age. Early intervention with repeated intravenous treatment of pabinafusp alfa decreased heparan sulfate deposition in the retina, optic nerve, and visual cortex, thus preserving or even improving the ERG response in MPS II mice. Histological analysis further revealed that pabinafusp alfa mitigated the loss of the photoreceptor layer observed in diseased mice. In contrast, recombinant nonfused IDS failed to reach the retina and hardly affected the retinal disease. These results support the hypothesis that transferrin receptor-targeted IDS can penetrate the BRB, thereby ameliorating retinal dysfunction in MPS II.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety",,retinopathy,3

The ATD model was established by subcutaneous injection of scopolamine hydrobromide (0.6 mg/dose, 4 times/d for 10 days). For guinea pigs of the acupuncture group, filiform needles were inserted into bilateral ""Jingming""(BL1), ""Cuanzhu""(BL2), ""Sizhukong""(TE23), ""Taiyang""(EX-HN5), and ""Tongziliao""(GB1) for 15 min. For guinea pigs of the sham-acupuncture group, a blunt filiform needle was used to repeatedly prick (not pierce) the skin of the same acupoints mentioned above. The treatment in the above two groups was conducted once daily for 14 days. The guinea pigs in the medication group received administration of sodium hyaluronate eye drops in both eyes, three times a day for 14 days. The objective tests of tear film break-up time (BUT), corneal fluorescein staining score (FLS) and phenol red thread (PRT) test were conducted before and after modeling and after the intervention. After the intervention, the lacrimal index (weight of lacrimal gland/body weight) was calculated. Histopathological changes of the lacrimal gland were observed after H.E. staining. The expression of AQP5 in the lacrimal gland were detected by immunofluorescence, and the contents of VIP and AQP5 in the lacrimal gland were measured by ELISA, the protein expression levels of VIP, cAMP, PKA, p-PKA and AQP5 in the lacrimal gland were detected by Western blot.In comparison with the blank control group, the PRT, BUT, lacrimal index, AQP5 immunoactivity, contents of VIP and AQP5, and protein expression levels of VIP, cAMP, PKA, p-PKA and AQP5 were significantly decreased(P<0.01, P<0.05), and FLS was obviously increased (P<0.01) in the model group . Compared to the model group, the PRT, BUT, lacrimal index, AQP5 immunoactivity, contents of VIP and AQP5, and expression levels of VIP and AQP5 in both acupuncture and medication groups, and the expression levels of cAMP, PKA, p-PKA in the acupuncture group were considerably increased (P<0.01, P<0.05), while the FLS was markedly decreased in both acupuncture and medication groups (P<0.01, P<0.05). Compared with the medication group, the acupuncture group had increased PRT (P<0.05).Acupuncture intervention is effective in reducing ocular surface damage and promoting tear secretion in guinea pigs with ATD, which may be related to its function in activating VIP/cAMP/PKA signaling, and promoting the expression of AQP5 in the lacrimal gland.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,dry eye,3
2023-11-13,37899299,Does cardiovascular risk matter in IBD patients?,"Cardiovascular and thromboembolic risks are increasing in the population as a whole and therefore also in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Obesity is a worldwide challenge also affecting the IBD population, and a causal association with Crohn's disease may exist. IBD itself, particularly when active, is also associated with a significant risk of thromboembolic and cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Cardiovascular risk is also a significant consideration when using Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors and sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators to treat IBD. JAK inhibitors - such as tofacitinib - are associated with several cardiovascular and venous thromboembolic risks, including hypertension and alterations in lipid profiles - specifically, increased LDL cholesterol and triglycerides - which may contribute to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. S1P receptor modulators pose a slightly different set of cardiovascular risks. Initially, these drugs can cause transient bradycardia and atrioventricular (AV) block, leading to bradycardia. Moreover, they may induce QT interval prolongation, which increases the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. Some patients may also experience hypertension as a side effect. In this context, IBD healthcare providers need to be alert to the assessment of cardiovascular risk - particularly as cardiovascular events appear to be confined to specific patient groups with pre-existing risk factors. In addition, the potential for S1P modulator drug interactions requires a higher level of vigilance in patients with polypharmacy compared to biologics. Cardiovascular risk is not static, and updated assessment will need to become part of the routine in many IBD units.",no,yes,no,other,safety,,"crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis",3

Conventional SjS treatments address the symptoms, but not the cause of disease. Recognizing this deficit of treatments to reverse SjS disease, studies were pursued using the fimbriae from enterotoxigenic E. coli, colonization factor antigen I (CFA/I), which has anti-inflammatory properties. To determine if CFA/I fimbriae could attenuate SjS-like disease in C57BL/6.NOD-Aec1Aec2 (SjS) females, the Lactococcus lactis (LL) 301 strain was developed to chromosomally express the cfaI operon. Western blot analysis confirmed CFA/I protein expression, and this was tested in SjS females at different stages of disease. Repeated dosing with LL 301 proved effective in mitigating salivary flow loss and in reducing anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) and inflammation in the submandibular glands (SMGs) in SjS females and in restoring salivary flow in diseased mice. LL 301 treatment reduced proinflammatory cytokine production with concomitant increases in TGF-β+ CD25+ CD4+ T cells. Moreover, LL 301 treatment reduced draining lymph and SMG follicular T helper (Tfh) cell levels and proinflammatory cytokines, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-17, and IL-21.

Previous studies have shown that the Tongqiao Mingmu (TQMM) formula can reduce retinal and optic nerve damage, but its mechanism of action requires further elucidation. In this study, an RGC injury model was prepared using glutamate and then treated with serum-containing drug from the TQMM formula (hereafter called ""TQMM formula serum""). In the glutamate-induced RGC injury model, cell viability decreased with an increase in glutamate concentration, whereas the expression of autophagy-related biomarkers LC3 and Belicin-1 increased. An adenovirus transfection experiment revealed that glutamate markedly promoted autophagic flux in RGCs. Notably, TQMM formula serum inhibited the expression of autophagy-related biomarkers, reduced autophagy flux, and reversed the damage caused by glutamate to RGCs. Furthermore, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 was used to intervene in the RGC autophagy model and was found to suppress the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and enhance RGC autophagy. However, TQMM formula serum could generate an opposite effect and upregulate the expressions of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway genes and proteins. In conclusion, the TQMM formula can prevent glutamate-induced autophagy in RGCs, possibly by activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and reducing the expression of autophagy-related biomarkers LC3 and Belicin-1 to attenuate autophagy and maintain RGC viability.",no,yes,no,in vitro,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinal disease,3

The efficacy of FMT is related to the microbial structure and composition of the donor. Mild moxibustion is a non-invasive and safe traditional Chinese therapy that can regulate the gut microbiota. In this study, we investigated whether moxibustion improved the efficacy of FMT in donors using a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model. Normal mice were treated with mild moxibustion at acupoints ST25 and ST36 for 7 days. DSS (2%) was administered for 7 days to induce colitis. FMT was performed on Day 8 and lasted for 7 days. The effect of FMT on mice with DSS was observed on Day 21. Using hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunofluorescence, we analyzed the pathology and cell proliferation after FMT in DSS mice. In addition, using 16 S rDNA sequencing analysis, we investigated the gut microbiota of mice. The results indicated that moxibustion altered the colonic microbial community and increased the relative abundance of specific bacteria without changes in morphology and physiological function in normal mice. FMT using donors with moxibustion reduced body weight loss, inflammation, abnormal microbial community structure, and the relative abundance of some bacteria.

Approved and investigational agents have largely focused on interfering with the activity of complement components 3 and 5, owing to their central roles in the classical, lectin, and alternative complement pathways. Other investigational therapies have targeted formation of membrane attack complex (a terminal step in the complement cascade which leads to cell lysis), complement factors H and I (which serve regulatory functions in the alternative pathway), complement factors B and D (within the alternative pathway), and complement component 1 (within the classical pathway). Clinical trials investigating these agents are summarized, and the potential benefits and limitations of these therapies are discussed.Targeting the complement system is a promising therapeutic approach for slowing the progression of GA in AMD, potentially improving visual outcomes. However, increased risk of exudative conversion must be considered, and further research is required to identify clinical criteria and best practices for initiating complement inhibitor therapy for GA.",no,yes,no,other,"effectiveness, safety",,retinal disease,3

2023-11-14,37786347,Human Neural Progenitors Expressing GDNF Enhance Retinal Protection in a Rodent Model of Retinal Degeneration.,"Stem cell therapy for retinal degenerative diseases has been extensively tested in preclinical and clinical studies. However, preclinical studies performed in animal models at the early stage of disease do not optimally translate to patients that present to the clinic at a later stage of disease. As the retina degenerates, inflammation and oxidative stress increase and trophic factor support declines. Testing stem cell therapies in animal models at a clinically relevant stage is critical for translation to the clinic. Human neural progenitor cells (hNPC) and hNPC engineered to stably express GDNF (hNPCGDNF) were subretinally injected into the Royal College of Surgeon (RCS) rats, a well-established model for retinal degeneration, at early and later stages of the disease. hNPCGDNF treatment at the early stage of retinal degeneration provided enhanced visual function compared to hNPC alone. Treatment with both cell types resulted in preserved retinal morphology compared to controls. hNPCGDNF treatment led to significantly broader photoreceptor protection than hNPC treatment at both early and later times of intervention. The phagocytic role of hNPC appears to support RPE cell functions and the secreted GDNF offers neuroprotection and enables the extended survival of photoreceptor cells in transplanted animal eyes. Donor cells in the RCS rat retina survived with only limited proliferation, and hNPCGDNF produced GDNF in vivo. Cell treatment led to significant changes in various pathways related to cell survival, antioxidative stress, phagocytosis, and autophagy. A combined stem cell and trophic factor therapy holds great promise for treating retinal degenerative diseases including retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinal disease,3
2023-11-14,37936170,Spatiotemporal roles of AMPK in PARP-1- and autophagy-dependent retinal pigment epithelial cell death caused by UVA.,"Although stimulating autophagy caused by UV has been widely demonstrated in skin cells to exert cell protection, it remains unknown the cellular events in UVA-treated retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells.Human ARPE-19 cells were used to measure cell viability, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), mitochondrial mass and lysosomal mass by flow cytometry. Mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was recorded using Seahorse XF flux analyzer. Confocal microscopic images were performed to indicate the mitochondrial dynamics, LC3 level, and AMPK translocation after UVA irradiation.We confirmed mitochondrial ROS production and DNA damage are two major features caused by UVA. We found the cell death is prevented by autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine and gene silencing of ATG5, and UVA induces ROS-dependent LC3II expression, LC3 punctate and TFEB expression, suggesting the autophagic death in the UVA-stressed RPE cells. Although PARP-1 inhibitor olaparib increases DNA damage, ROS production, and cell death, it also blocks AMPK activation caused by UVA. Interestingly we found a dramatic nuclear export of AMPK upon UVA irradiation which is blocked by N-acetylcysteine and olaparib. In addition, UVA exposure gradually decreases lysosomal mass and inhibits cathepsin B activity at late phase due to lysosomal dysfunction. Nevertheless, cathepsin B inhibitor, CA-074Me, reverses the death extent, suggesting the contribution of cathepsin B in the death pathway. When examining the role of EGFR in cellular events caused by UVA, we found that UVA can rapidly transactivate EGFR, and treatment with EGFR TKIs (gefitinib and afatinib) enhances the cell death accompanied by the increased LC3II formation, ROS production, loss of MMP and mass of mitochondria and lysosomes. Although AMPK activation by ROS-PARP-1 mediates autophagic cell death, we surprisingly found that pretreatment of cells with AMPK activators (A769662 and metformin) reverses cell death. Concomitantly, both agents block UVA-induced mitochondrial ROS production, autophagic flux, and mitochondrial fission without changing the inhibition of cathepsin B.UVA exposure rapidly induces ROS-PARP-1-AMPK-autophagic flux and late lysosomal dysfunction. Pre-inducing AMPK activation can prevent cellular events caused by UVA and provide a new protective strategy in photo-oxidative stress and photo-retinopathy.",no,yes,no,in vitro,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,retinopathy,3

However, the microRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation in human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells has not been adequately investigated. We investigated how miR-626 inhibits mTOR activity pathways and pathway-related genes in retinal pigment epithelial cells by targeting the solute carrier family seven-member 5 (SLC7A5) in ARPE19 cells.    We transfected mir-626 mimic, mir-626 inhibitör and siRNA in human retinal pigment epithelial cell line was examined using RT-PCR and western blot, respectively. We knocked down mir-626 levels and overexpression by mir-626-siRNA transfection of human RPE cell lines, and using an MTT assay, we assessed the role of SLC7A5 on RPE cell proliferation. We additionally measured the expression of mTOR, Akt1, caspase 3, Bax, SLC17A7, SLC17A8, Creb1, Pten, HIF1A, HIFI. The findings demonstrate that mir-626 inhibits SLC7A5 gene expression and proliferation of ARPE-19 cells. Short interfering RNA (siRNA) mediated suppression of SLC7A5, a predicted target of mir-626, has the same effect on ARPE-19 cells. We identified how miR-626 causes apoptosis and macula degeneration in RPE cells by targeting SLC7A5 through the mTOR signaling pathway. miR-626 was an essential regulator of the expression of the Slc7a5 gene. Importantly, we determined that miR-626 is essential to play a role in AMD.

Attenuates Acetic Acid-Induced Colitis in Rats by Regulation of Inflammatory Mediators.,"In traditional medicine, many medicinal plants are used in the treatment of various diseases caused by inflammation. The objective of the present study is to elucidate for the first time the effects of Cotinus coggygria (CC) ethanol extract (CCE) on colonic structure and inflammation of acetic acid-induced ulcerative colitis in rats. Colonic damage was assessed using disease activity index score, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and hematoxylin-eosin staining. Also, in vitro antioxidant activity of CCE was investigated by ABTS methods. Total phytochemical content of CCE was measured spectroscopically. Acetic acid caused colonic damage according to disease activity index and macroscopic scoring. CCE significantly reversed these damages. While the levels of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and TGF-1beta increased in tissue with UC, IL-10 level decreased. CCE increased inflammatory cytokine levels to values close to the sham group. At the same time, while markers indicating disease severity such as VEGF, COX-2, PGE2, and 8-OHdG indicated the disease in the colitis group, these values returned to normal with CCE. Histological research results support biochemical analysis. CCE exhibited significant antioxidant against ABTS radical. Also, CCE was found to have a high content of total polyphenolic compounds. These findings provide evidence that CCE might be benefit as a promising novel therapy in the treatment of UC in humans due to high polyphenol content and justify the use of CC in folkloric medicine for treatment of inflamed diseases.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3

However, the colon mucus layer, a critical physiological barrier against external threats, is also a biological barrier, limiting the potential for effective drug delivery to the lamina propria for regulating inflammatory cells. Inspired by the potential of Hyaluronic acid (HA), to enhance cellular uptake by inflammatory cells, and Pluronic® F127 (F127), known for overcoming the mucus barrier, this study innovatively developed INB/IND nanosuspensions by co-modifying with F127 and HA. Moreover, inulin serves a dual purpose as a spray protective agent and a regulator of intestinal flora. Therefore, it was incorporated into INB/IND nanosuspensions for subsequent spray drying, resulting in the preparation of INB/IND nanocrystals (INB/IND-NC). The mucus penetration of INB/IND-NC was 24.30 times that of the control group. Besides, INB/IND-NC exhibited enhanced cellular uptake properties proximately twice that of Raw INB/IND. Importantly, INB/IND-NC exhibited improved therapeutic efficacy in DSS-induced mice by regulating the expression of cytokines, regulating immune responses via downregulating the expression of macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells and maintaining intestinal flora homeostasis.

However, drug delivery in patients with ocular diseases is faced with various challenges. In this study, we developed flexible liposomes based on trimethylated chitosan (TMC-Lipo) to deliver resveratrol for the treatment of retinal diseases. Flexible liposomes can easily cross various biological barriers. Chitosan and its derivatives have adhesive properties and are widely used in mucoadhesive drug delivery systems. Therefore, we wrapped flexible liposomes with trimethylated chitosan via electrostatic adsorption. The charge of the flexible liposomes became positive after encapsulation in TMC, and they remained stable in artificial tears. We assessed the safety of TMC-Lipo in cellular and zebrafish experiments and found that it can be safely used. In addition, treatment with TMC-Lipo significantly reduced H2O2-induced damage to ARPE-19 cells, restored mitochondrial membrane potential, and protected the cells. TMC-Lipo more easily reached the posterior ocular segment of the mice than liposome nanoparticles and attenuated blue-light-induced retinal cytopathy.

Besides, the effects of long-term and extreme meteorological factors on DED and the lag effect have not been fully evaluated. Electronic case information of 9970 DED outpatients from the Ophthalmology Department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University (Urumqi, Xinjiang, China) between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2020, was screened and analyzed. We used a time-series analysis design and a quasi-Poisson generalized linear regression model combined with a distributed lagged nonlinear model (DLNM) to fit the effects of exposure to different meteorological factors and extreme weather on DED outpatient visits. Subgroup analyses were further performed for gender, age, and season. The results showed that exposure to extremely low mean temperature (P1:RR = 1.18), atmospheric pressure (P1:RR = 1.11), and extremely high relative humidity (P99:RR = 1.35) were the risk factors, while extremely high atmospheric pressure (P90:RR = 0.883) and extremely low humidity (P10:RR = 0.856) appeared to have a positive effect on reduced risk of DED. Relative humidity exhibited a 1-day lag effect (RR = 1.06). Increased mean temperature positively affected female DED patients (RR = 0.761) with similar effects in the cold season (RR = 0.926). However, elevated relative humidity had a negative effect on female patients (RR = 1.14). We conducted the first large sample size time-series analysis study in this major city at the farthest distance from the ocean in the world and in northwest China, confirming the association of DED outpatient visits with the remaining three meteorological factors except wind speed in Urumqi, and a larger sample size multi-center epidemiological study with a longer duration is still needed.",no,yes,no,other,effectiveness,,dry eye,3
2023-11-15,37833870,Disrupting the Repeat Domain of Premelanosome Protein (PMEL) Produces Dysamyloidosis and Dystrophic Ocular Pigment Reflective of Pigmentary Glaucoma.,"Pigmentary glaucoma has recently been associated with missense mutations in PMEL that are dominantly inherited and enriched in the protein's fascinating repeat domain. PMEL pathobiology is intriguing because PMEL forms functional amyloid in healthy eyes, and this PMEL amyloid acts to scaffold melanin deposition. This is an informative contradistinction to prominent neurodegenerative diseases where amyloid formation is neurotoxic and mutations cause a toxic gain of function called ""amyloidosis"". Preclinical animal models have failed to model this PMEL ""dysamyloidosis"" pathomechanism and instead cause recessively inherited ocular pigment defects via PMEL loss of function; they have not addressed the consequences of disrupting PMEL's repetitive region. Here, we use CRISPR to engineer a small in-frame mutation in the zebrafish homolog of PMEL that is predicted to subtly disrupt the protein's repetitive region. Homozygous mutant larvae displayed pigmentation phenotypes and altered eye morphogenesis similar to presumptive null larvae. Heterozygous mutants had disrupted eye morphogenesis and disrupted pigment deposition in their retinal melanosomes. The deficits in the pigment deposition of these young adult fish were not accompanied by any detectable glaucomatous changes in intraocular pressure or retinal morphology. Overall, the data provide important in vivo validation that subtle PMEL mutations can cause a dominantly inherited pigment pathology that aligns with the inheritance of pigmentary glaucoma patient pedigrees. These in vivo observations help to resolve controversy regarding the necessity of PMEL's repeat domain in pigmentation. The data foster an ongoing interest in an antithetical dysamyloidosis mechanism that, akin to the amyloidosis of devastating dementias, manifests as a slow progressive neurodegenerative disease.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,retinopathy,3

OGR1 and TDAG8 show opposite effects. To determine which effect is predominant or physiologically more relevant, we deleted both receptors in models of intestinal inflammation. Combined Ogr1 and Tdag8 deficiency was assessed in spontaneous and acute murine colitis models. Disease severity was assessed using clinical scores. Colon samples were analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and flow cytometry (FACS). In acute colitis, Ogr1-deficient mice showed significantly decreased clinical scores compared with wildtype (WT) mice, while Tdag8-deficient mice and double knockout (KO) mice presented similar scores to WT. In Il-10-spontaneous colitis, Ogr1-deficient mice presented significantly decreased, and Tdag8-deficient mice had increased inflammation. In the Il10-/- × Ogr1-/- × Tdag8-/- triple KO mice, inflammation was significantly decreased compared with Tdag8-/-. Absence of Ogr1 reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines in Tdag8-deficient mice. Tdag8-/- had significantly more IFNγ+ T-lymphocytes and IL-23 T-helper cells in the colon compared with WT.

The protective effect of BDB in maintaining the diabetic retinal neurovascular units was verified using type 1 diabetic mouse models. Additionally, the inhibitory effect of BDB on the levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were examined.In vitro experiments revealed that BDB promoted vascular integrity, inhibited the transcription of pro-inflammatory factors, and alleviated hyperglycemia-induced permeability. BDB also protected RGC from hyperglycemia-induced apoptosis. In diabetic mice models, BDB treatment maintained the integrity of diabetic retinal neurovascular units and inhibited the secretion of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6.BDB demonstrated a protective effect on DR by inhibiting the secretion of inflammatory factors, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of DR.

This study aimed to investigate the potential protective effects of MCP on early-stage DR and explore the underlying mechanisms. The model group (DM group) and treatment group (D+H group) were established by inducing type 1 DM using a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ) at 60 mg/kg. After modeling, the D+H group was orally administered a 500 mg/kg dose of MCP solution once daily for 12 weeks. Monitoring of systemic indicators (FBG, body weight, general condition) and retinal tissue inflammation and apoptosis (HE staining, IL-6, MCP-1, TNF-α, VEGF, NF-κB, Caspase-3) in this study demonstrated that MCP intervention alleviated both DM and DR. MCP improved the body weight and general condition of DM rats by reducing FBG levels. It also enhanced the anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic capabilities of retinal neurons and microvessels by modulating the actions of cytokines, thereby further regulating the inflammation and apoptosis of retinal neurons and microvessels. The underlying mechanisms may be associated with the downregulation of NF-κB and Caspase-3 pathway protein expression, as well as the downregulation of mRNA expression of NF-κB and Caspase-3 pathway genes.

2023-11-15,37875948,NRF2/ARE mediated antioxidant response to glaucoma: role of glia and retinal ganglion cells.,"Glaucoma, the second leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, is associated with age and sensitivity to intraocular pressure (IOP). We have shown that elevated IOP causes an early increase in levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the microbead occlusion mouse model. We also detected an endogenous antioxidant response mediated by Nuclear factor erythroid 2-Related Factor 2 (NRF2), a transcription factor that binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) and increases transcription of antioxidant genes. Our previous studies show that inhibiting this pathway results in earlier and greater glaucoma pathology. In this study, we sought to determine if this endogenous antioxidant response is driven by the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) or glial cells. We used Nrf2fl/fl mice and cell-type specific adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) expressing Cre to alter Nrf2 levels in either the RGCs or glial cells. Then, we quantified the endogenous antioxidant response, visual function and optic nerve histology after IOP elevation. We found that knock-down of Nrf2 in either cell type blunts the antioxidant response and results in earlier pathology and vision loss. Further, we show that delivery of Nrf2 to the RGCs is sufficient to provide neuroprotection. In summary, both the RGCs and glial cells contribute to the antioxidant response, but treatment of the RGCs alone with increased Nrf2 is sufficient to delay onset of vision loss and axon degeneration in this induced model of glaucoma.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety",,retinal disease,3

We studied oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) which develops in two phases, featuring hyperoxia-induced retinal vaso-obliteration in phase I, followed by retinal neovascularization in phase II. As neutrophils are acute responders to tissue damage, we evaluated whether neutrophil depletion with an anti-Ly6G mAb administered in phase I OIR influenced retinal inflammation and vascular injury. Neutrophils were measured in blood and spleen via flow cytometry, and myeloperoxidase, an indicator of neutrophil activity, was evaluated in the retina using Western blotting. Retinal vasculopathy was assessed by quantitating vaso-obliteration, neovascularization, vascular leakage, and VEGF levels. The inflammatory factors, TNF, MCP-1, and ICAM-1 were measured in retina. In the OIR controls, neutrophils were increased in the blood and spleen in phase I but not phase II OIR. In OIR, the anti-Ly6G mAb reduced neutrophils in the blood and spleen, and myeloperoxidase, inflammation, and vasculopathy in the retina.

These involved the 2-AG exogenous administration (a) intraperitoneally (i.p.) and (b) topically and (c) by enhancing the 2-AG endogenous levels via the inhibition (AM11920, i.p.) of its metabolic enzymes (MAGL/ABHD6). Sprague Dawley rats were treated as mentioned above in the presence or absence of CB1/CB2R antagonists and the excitatory amino acid, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA). Immunohistochemistry, Western blot and a 2-AG level analyses were performed. The 2-AG repeated treatment (i.p.) induced the CB1R downregulation, abolishing its neuroprotective actions. However, 2-AG attenuated the AMPA-induced activation of microglia via the CB2R, as concurred by the AM630 antagonist effect. Topically administered 2-AG was efficacious as a neuroprotectant/antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory agent. AM11920 increased the 2-AG levels providing neuroprotection against excitotoxicity and reduced microglial activation without affecting the CB1R expression. Our findings show that 2-AG, in the three paradigms studied, displays differential pharmacological profiles in terms of the downregulation of the CB1R and neuroprotection. All treatments, however, attenuated the activation of microglia via the CB2R activation, supporting the anti-inflammatory role of 2-AG in the retina.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety",,retinal disease,3
2023-11-15,37958909,The Effect of Anti-Autotaxin Aptamers on the Development of Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy.,"This study investigated the effect of anti-autotaxin (ATX) aptamers on the development of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) in both in vivo and in vitro PVR swine models. For the in vitro study, primary retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells were obtained from porcine eyes and cultured for cell proliferation and migration assays. For the in vivo study, a swine PVR model was established by inducing retinal detachment and injecting cultured RPE cells (2.0 × 106). Concurrently, 1 week after RPE cell injection, the anti-ATX aptamer, RBM-006 (10 mg/mL, 0.1 mL), was injected twice into the vitreous cavity. Post-injection effects of the anti-ATX aptamer on PVR development in the in vivo swine PVR model were investigated. For the in vitro evaluation, the cultured RPE cell proliferation and migration were significantly reduced at anti-ATX aptamer concentrations of 0.5-0.05 mg and at only 0.5 mg, respectively. Intravitreal administration of the anti-ATX aptamer also prevented tractional retinal detachment caused by PVR in the in vivo PVR model. We observed that the anti-ATX aptamer, RBM-006, inhibited PVR-related RPE cell proliferation and migration in vitro and inhibited the progression of PVR in the in vivo model, suggesting that the anti-ATX aptamer may be effective in preventing PVR.",no,yes,no,animal,effectiveness,,retinopathy,3
2023-11-15,37959758,Atractylone in the ,"The aim of this study was to conduct a screening of potential therapeutic compounds found in the Atractylodes macrocephala rhizoma essential oil (AO) and explore its mechanism of action in the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). An inflammation cell model was employed in conjunction with phospho-antibody array technology to explore potential therapeutic compounds of AO and their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Furthermore, we assessed their efficacy and mechanisms of action in treating dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. Via the screening process, we identified atractylone (ATR) as the primary active compound in AO. It has been demonstrated that ATR can both decrease the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increase the expression of adhesion proteins such as claudin, ZO-1, and occludin in vitro. Moreover, ATR has been shown to improve UC symptoms in vivo. Via a non-targeted metabolomics analysis of colon tissue, we identified 57 distinct metabolites that responded to ATR treatment. Subsequent analysis of the metabolic pathways revealed that the action of ATR was primarily focused on the amino acid metabolism pathway. In summary, ATR may alleviate the symptoms of UC by regulating multiple signaling pathways. Additionally, ATR has a comprehensive function in anti-inflammation, antioxidative stress, and intestinal injury reduction.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3
2023-11-15,37960213,,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a non-specific inflammatory bowel illness characterized by intestinal mucosal barrier degradation, inflammation, oxidative damage, and gut microbiota imbalances. Rosa roxburghii Tratt Fruit extract (RRTE) was extracted from Rosa roxburghii Tratt fruit, exhibiting an excellent prevention effect against UC; RRTE could prevent the damage of DSS-induced human normal colonic epithelial (NCM 460) cells, especially in cell viability and morphology, and oxidative damage. Additionally, in UC mice, RRTE could limit the intestinal mucosal barrier by increasing the expression of intestinal tight junction proteins and mucin, reducing inflammation and oxidative damage in colon tissue. More importantly, RRTE can increase the abundance of beneficial bacteria to regulate gut microbiota such as Ruminococcus, Turicibacter, and Parabacteroides, and reduce the abundance of harmful bacteria such as Staphylococcus and Shigella. Furthermore, transcriptomics of colonic mucosal findings point out that the beneficial effect of RRTE on UC could be attributed to the modulation of inflammatory responses such as the IL-17 and TNF signaling pathways. The qPCR results confirm that RRTE did involve the regulation of several genes in the IL-17 signaling pathway. In conclusion, RRTE could prevent DSS-induced damage both in vitro and in vivo.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3
2023-11-15,37960728,Network pharmacology and molecular docking reveal potential mechanism of esculetin in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease of the colonic mucosa. Esculetin is a type of natural coumarin that has many pharmacological activities such as antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, etc. A previous study showed that esculetin improved intestinal inflammation and reduced serum proinflammatory cytokines in UC. The present study aimed to utilize network pharmacology and molecular docking to explore the potential mechanism of esculetin against UC. The potential gene targets of esculetin were predicted through SwissTargetPrediction and Super-PRED web servers. UC-related genes were obtained from DisGeNet, OMIM, and GeneCards databases. The overlap between gene targets of esculetin and UC-related genes were identified as the potential targets of esculetin against UC. The interaction between these overlapping genes was analyzed by the STRING database and the core genes were identified by Cytoscape platform. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis of the core genes were then performed. And the results of these analyses were further confirmed through molecular docking. A total of 50 overlapping genes were identified as the potential action targets of esculetin against UC. Among them, 10 genes (AKT1, STAT1, CCND1, SRC, PTGS2, EGFR, NFKB1, ESR1, MMP9, SERPINE1) were finally identified as the core genes. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis results showed that the top signaling pathway associated with the core genes of esculetin against UC was the prolactin (PRL) signaling pathway. Molecular docking results showed that esculetin has a strong binding affinity to the core genes, as well as PRL and prolactin receptor. This study suggests that esculetin may have a crucial impact on UC through the PRL signaling pathway and provides insights into the potential mechanism of esculetin in the treatment of UC, which may shed light on the mechanism and treatment of UC.",no,yes,no,other,"effectiveness, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3
2023-11-16,36094642,UBE3D Is Involved in Blue Light-Induced Retinal Damage by Regulating Double-Strand Break Repair.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is currently the leading cause of blindness worldwide. Previously, we identified ubiquitin-protein ligase E3D (UBE3D) as an AMD-associated protein for East Asian populations, and here we further demonstrate that UBE3D could be associated with DNA damage response.The established I-SceI-inducible GFP reporter system was used to explore the effect of UBE3D on homologous recombination. Immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (MS) was used to explore potential UBE3D-interacting proteins and validated with coimmunoprecipitation assays and the pulldown assays. Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) assays were used to investigate the function of UBE3D on heterochromatin de-condensation upon DNA damage. An aged mouse model of blue light-induced eye damage was constructed, and electroretinography (ERG) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were performed to compare the differences between wild-type and UBE3D+/- mice.First, we show that GFP-UBE3D is recruited to damage sites by PCNA, through a PCNA-interacting protein (PIP) box. Furthermore, UBE3D interacts with KAP1 via R377R378 and oxidation of the AMD-associated V379M mutation abolishes KAP1-UBE3D binding. By MNase assays, UBE3D depletion reduces the chromatin relaxation levels upon DNA damage. In addition, UBE3D depletion renders less KAP1 recruitment. Compared with wild type, blue light induces less damage in UBE3D+/- mice as measured by ERG and OCT, consistent with our biochemical results.Hence, we propose that one potential mechanism that UBE3D-V379M contributes to AMD pathogenesis might be via defective DNA damage repair linked with oxidative stress and our results offered a potential direction for the treatment of AMD.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinal disease,3
2023-11-16,37464864,Mitochondrial Genome-Encoded Long Noncoding RNA Cytochrome B and Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Diabetic Retinopathy.,"Aims: Mitochondrial dysfunction is closely associated with the development of diabetic complications. In diabetic retinopathy, electron transport chain is compromised and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is damaged, downregulating transcription of mtDNA-encoded cytochrome B (CYTB) and its antisense long noncoding RNA, long noncoding RNA cytochrome B (LncCytB). Our goal was to investigate the role of LncCytB in the regulation of CYTB and mitochondrial function in diabetic retinopathy. Methods: Using human retinal endothelial cells, genetically manipulated for LncCytB (overexpression or silencing), the effect of high glucose (20 mM d-glucose) on LncCytB-CYTB interactions (by chromatin isolation by RNA purification), CYTB gene expression (by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction), complex III activity, mitochondrial free radicals, and oxygen consumption rate (OCR, by Seahorse XF analyzer) was investigated. Key results were confirmed in the retinal microvessels from streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Results: High glucose decreased LncCytB-CYTB interactions, and while LncCytB overexpression ameliorated glucose-induced decrease in CYTB gene transcripts, complex III activity and OCR and increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, LncCytB-siRNA further attenuated CYTB gene transcription, complex III activity, and OCR. Similar decrease in LncCytB-CYTB interactions and CYTB transcription was observed in diabetic mice. Furthermore, maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis by overexpressing superoxide dismutase or sirtuin 1 in mice ameliorated diabetes-induced decrease in LncCytB-CYTB interactions and CYTB gene transcripts, and also improved complex III activity and mitochondrial respiration. Innovation and Conclusion: LncCytB downregulation in hyperglycemic milieu downregulates CYTB transcription, which inhibits complex III activity and compromises mitochondrial stability and OCR. Thus, preventing LncCytB downregulation in diabetes has potential of inhibiting the development of diabetic retinopathy, possibly via maintaining mitochondrial respiration. Antioxid.

2023-11-16,37963876,Dietary L-Tryptophan consumption determines the number of colonic regulatory T cells and susceptibility to colitis via GPR15.,"Environmental factors are the major contributor to the onset of immunological disorders such as ulcerative colitis. However, their identities remain unclear. Here, we discover that the amount of consumed L-Tryptophan (L-Trp), a ubiquitous dietary component, determines the transcription level of the colonic T cell homing receptor, GPR15, hence affecting the number of colonic FOXP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells and local immune homeostasis. Ingested L-Trp is converted by host IDO1/2 enzymes, but not by gut microbiota, to compounds that induce GPR15 transcription preferentially in Treg cells via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. Consequently, two weeks of dietary L-Trp supplementation nearly double the colonic GPR15+ Treg cells via GPR15-mediated homing and substantially reduce the future risk of colitis. In addition, humans consume 3-4 times less L-Trp per kilogram of body weight and have fewer colonic GPR15+ Treg cells than mice. Thus, we uncover a microbiota-independent mechanism linking dietary L-Trp and colonic Treg cells, that may have therapeutic potential.",no,yes,no,animal,effectiveness,,ulcerative colitis,3
2023-11-16,37964513,Severe Dry Eye Disease in Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease: A Comprehensive Case Report.,"BACKGROUND Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a hereditary neurological disorder that primarily leads to peripheral neuropathy, characterized by progressive muscle weakness, atrophy, and loss of sensation in the extremities. It can also present with some ocular manifestations, such as glaucoma, nystagmus, and cranial nerve involvement. The purpose of this article was to report a case of severe dry eye disease (DED) possibly associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. CASE REPORT We report the clinical presentation, workup, and management of a woman diagnosed with CMT type 2EE based on genetic testing who suffered from severe DED sequelae. The patient had regularly followed up in the cornea service at our hospital due to DED for several years. A thorough workup to exclude causes associated with dry eye disease, including rheumatoid factor, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), anti-Sjögren's-syndrome-related antigen A (anti-SSA), and anti-Sjögren's-syndrome-related antigen B (Anti-SSB), were performed, and all came out negative. She recently presented to the emergency room with redness, tearing, and a decline in visual acuity after minor ocular trauma 3 weeks before her presentation. The slit lamp examination showed central corneal perforation measuring 2×2 mm with a positive Seidel test. The case was managed first by multiple attempts to seal the defect with cyanoacrylate glue, and then a patch corneal graft was performed as the anterior chamber failed to deepen. CONCLUSIONS DED may be one of the many ocular manifestations associated with CMT. Hence, a thorough assessment and multidisciplinary approach, including supportive therapy, are warranted to prevent long-term ocular sequelae, including visual loss.",no,yes,no,other,safety,,dry eye,3
2023-11-16,37964544,Expression of YAP suppresses cell proliferation and elevates the sensitivity of chemotherapy in retinoblastoma cells through lipid-peroxidation induced ferroptosis.,"Retinoblastoma (RB) is a retinal cancer most commonly occurred in young children. Cisplatin and etoposide had been confirmed as chemotherapy drugs in the treatment of RB, even though the phenomenon of chemotherapeutic resistance has been occurring in clinical treatment frequently. RB has been reported to be a tumor with reduced expression of yes-associated protein (YAP). However, the role of YAP protein and its correlation with the chemotherapy effect in RB still remains unknown.Here we used human RB cell lines Y79 and RB3823 to construct YAP over-expression cell lines for exploring the specific role of YAP. In vitro, a series of techniques and methods were used to identify the biological role of YAP in RB, such as Agilent Seahorse assay, lipid peroxidation assay, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) measurement, flow cytometry apoptosis assay, and other basic experimental techniques, among others.The cell growth and cytology experimental results found YAP can inhibit the proliferation of RB cells and promote their apoptosis (Y79 32.71% vs. 3.75%; RB3823 40.32% vs. 6.73%). The mitochondrial fuel flex test, lipid peroxide and ROS measurement confirmed that YAP over-expression could promote mitochondrial fatty-acids β-oxidation and lipid peroxidation in RB cells. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis for the expression of lipid peroxidation related factors imply that YAP over-expression caused ferroptosis in RB cell lines. In addition, YAP transcription specific activator PY-60 (10 µM) further improved the sensitivity of cisplatin/etoposide.Our research results found the expression of YAP inhibits cell proliferation and promoted lipid peroxidation induced ferroptosis in RB. Interestingly, the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation shows an increased fatty acid dependency and decreased glucose dependency. As a result, this phenomenon improved the sensitivity of RB to cisplatin/etoposide chemotherapy in vitro. Our finding provides a potential therapeutic target for RB chemotherapy.",no,yes,no,in vitro,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinopathy,3
2023-11-17,36001278,Inhibition of P2X7 receptors by Lu AF27139 diminishes colonic hypersensitivity and CNS prostanoid levels in a rat model of visceral pain.,"Visceral pain is a prominent feature of various gastrointestinal diseases. The P2X7 receptor is expressed by multiple cell types including dorsal root ganglion satellite glial cells, macrophages, and spinal microglia, all of which have been implicated in nociceptive sensitization. We have used the selective and CNS penetrant P2X7 receptor antagonist Lu AF27139 to explore this receptor's role in distinct rat models of inflammatory and visceral hypersensitivity. Rats injected with CFA in the hindpaw displayed a marked reduction in hindpaw mechanical threshold, which was dose-dependently reversed by Lu AF27139 (3-30 mg/kg, p.o.). In rats injected with TNBS in the proximal colon, the colorectal distension threshold measured distally was significantly lower than sham treated rats at 7 days post-injection (P < 0.001), indicative of a marked central sensitization. Colonic hypersensitivity was also reversed by Lu AF27139 (10-100 mg/kg) and by the κ-opioid receptor agonist U-50,488H (3 mg/kg, s.c.). Moreover, both Lu AF27139 and U-50,488H prevented a TNBS-induced increase in spinal and brain levels of PGE2 and LTB4, as well as an increase in brain levels of PGF2α and TXB2. Lu AF27139 was well tolerated as revealed by a lack of significant effect on rotarod motor function and coordination at all doses tested up to 300 mg/kg. Thus, P2X7 receptor antagonism is efficacious in a rat model of visceral pain, via a mechanism which potentially involves attenuation of microglial function within spinal and/or supraspinal pain circuits, albeit a peripheral site of action cannot be excluded.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety",,ulcerative colitis,3

The individualized treatment was based on the ocular conditions of each case. A novel genetic alteration in ZNF408 was identified in one patient. Two patients with short-axial eyes received unilateral combined trabeculectomy, cataract surgery, and Irido-zonulo-hyaloid-vitrectomy. One of them had a subluxated lens, managed with a capsular tension ring implantation. Their contralateral eyes, respectively, underwent laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) and transscleral cyclophotocoagulation. The third patient underwent bilaterally combined laser peripheral iridoplasty, LPI, and medication. Ultimately, all patients achieved the target IOP during a two-year follow-up.Young patients with RP may have a risk of developing angle closure glaucoma, and conversely, patients with angle closure glaucoma at younger age should be aware of the presence of RP.

2023-11-17,37968982,Activation of Lysosomal Function Ameliorates Amyloid-β-Induced Tight Junction Disruption in the Retinal Pigment Epithelium.,"Accumulation of pathogenic amyloid-β disrupts the tight junction of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), one of its senescence-like structural alterations. In the clearance of amyloid-β, the autophagy-lysosome pathway plays the crucial role. In this context, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibits the process of autophagy and lysosomal degradation, acting as a potential therapeutic target for age-associated disorders. However, efficacy of targeting mTOR to treat age-related macular degeneration remains largely elusive. Here, we validated the therapeutic efficacy of the mTOR inhibitors, Torin and PP242, in clearing amyloid-β by inducing the autophagy-lysosome pathway in a mouse model with pathogenic amyloid-β with tight junction disruption of RPE, which is evident in dry age-related macular degeneration. High concentration of amyloid-β oligomers induced autophagy-lysosome pathway impairment accompanied by the accumulation of p62 and decreased lysosomal activity in RPE cells. However, Torin and PP242 treatment restored the lysosomal activity via activation of LAMP2 and facilitated the clearance of amyloid-β in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, clearance of amyloid-β by Torin and PP242 ameliorated the tight junction disruption of RPE in vivo. Overall, our findings suggest mTOR inhibition as a new therapeutic strategy for the restoration of tight junctions in age-related macular degeneration.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety",,retinal disease,3
2023-11-20,35584771,Agonism of GPR120 Prevented High Glucose-Induced Apoptosis of Retinal Endothelial Cells through Inhibiting NLRP3 Inflammasome.,"GPR120 has been reported to ameliorate inflammation in diabetes and diabetic complications. In this study, GW9508, the GPR120 agonist, was utilized in human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs) exposed to high glucose (HG) to investigate the involvement of GPR120 in cellular viability and apoptosis as well as the association with the NLRP3 inflammasome.The expression of GPR120 in HRMECs cultured under HG was firstly detected by Western blotting. HRMECs were then assigned to the normal control, GW9508, HG, and HG + GW9508 groups. The expression of the NLRP3 inflammasome consists of NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 and was detected by Western blotting and the downstream IL-1β and IL-18 by ELISA. The cellular viability and apoptosis of HRMECs were detected by CCK-8 and flow cytometry, respectively. The expressions of apoptosis-related proteins Bax and Bcl-2 were detected by Western blotting. Finally, nonspecific siRNA (NS) or GPR120 siRNA (siGPR120) was transfected to the cells, followed by stimulation with or without GW9508 or HG, and the expression of NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 were detected by Western blotting in these groups.GPR120 is expressed in HRMECs, and HG can reduce its expression in a time-dependent manner. GW9508 can attenuate inflammation by reducing the expression of NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, IL-1β, and IL-18 under HG. GW9508 rescues the viability of HRMCs and reduces cell apoptosis by preventing an increase in Bax expression and the reduction in Bcl-2 expression. Additionally, knockdown of GPR120 by siRNA weakened the effects of GW9508 on NLRP3 inflammasome expression.Activation of GPR120 protects retinal vascular endothelial cells from HG through inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome. Thus, GPR120 might be a potential therapeutic target to reduce retinal endothelial damage in diabetic retinopathy.",no,yes,no,in vitro,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinopathy,3

There is no effective treatment other than supportive care. Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), which impairs vision irreversibly, is common in BPD, suggesting a related pathogenesis. However, specific mechanisms of BPD and ROP are not known. Herein, a neonatal mouse hyperoxic model of coincident BPD and retinopathy was used to screen for candidate mediators, which revealed that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), also known as colony-stimulating factor 3, was up-regulated significantly in mouse lung lavage fluid and plasma at postnatal day 14 in response to hyperoxia. Preterm infants with more severe BPD had increased plasma G-CSF. G-CSF-deficient neonatal pups showed significantly reduced alveolar simplification, normalized alveolar and airway resistance, and normalized weight gain compared with wild-type pups after hyperoxic lung injury. This was associated with a marked reduction in the intensity, and activation state, of neutrophilic and monocytic inflammation and its attendant oxidative stress response, and protection of lung endothelial cells. G-CSF deficiency also provided partial protection against ROP. The findings in this study implicate G-CSF as a pathogenic mediator of BPD and ROP, and suggest the therapeutic utility of targeting G-CSF biology to treat these conditions.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinopathy,3

Evidence suggests that dysregulated de novo lipogenesis in photoreceptors is a critical early target of diabetes. Following on this observation, the present study aimed to determine whether two interventions shown to improve diabetic retinopathy in mice-pharmacologic visual cycle inhibition and prolonged dark adaptation-reduce photoreceptor anabolic lipid metabolism. Elevated retinal lipid biosynthetic signaling was observed in two mouse models of diabetes, with both models showing reduced retinal AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) signaling, elevated acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) signaling, and increased activity of fatty acid synthase, which promotes lipotoxicity in photoreceptors. Although retinal AMPK-ACC axis signaling was dependent on systemic glucose fluctuations in healthy animals, mice with diabetes lacked such regulation. Visual cycle inhibition and prolonged dark adaptation reversed abnormal retinal AMPK-ACC signaling in mice with diabetes. Although visual cycle inhibition reduced the severity of diabetic retinopathy in control mice, as assessed by retinal capillary atrophy, this intervention was ineffective in fatty acid synthase gain-of-function mice. These results suggest that early diabetic retinopathy is characterized by glucose-driven elevations in retinal lipid biosynthetic activity, and that two interventions known to increase photoreceptor glucose demands alleviate disease by reversing these signals.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinopathy,3

While O2 is needed to prevent hypoxia, it also causes oxidative stress leading to a plethora of morbidities, including retinopathy and BPD. The advent of continuous O2 monitoring with pulse oximeters has allowed clinicians to recognize the narrow therapeutic margins of oxygenation for the preterm infant, but more knowledge is needed to understand what these ranges are at different stages of the preterm infant's life, including at birth, in the neonatal intensive care unit and after hospital discharge.

Tissue samples were collected for transcriptome and metabolomics analysis. Network pharmacology was performed on DS to identify bioactive compounds. Western blot was used to detect the key proteins involved in UC pathogenesis and PI3K/AKT pathways.DS exerted the preventive and therapeutic effects in improving UC via inhibiting abnormal inflammatory responses and promoting antioxidant capacity. Levels of intestinal barrier, oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators were improved to nearly normal level in vivo by DS. Metabolome profiles showed that DS could restore the metabolic disorders associated with the UC pathogenesis. Further transcriptome results showed that DS mainly alleviate UC through inhibiting PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, and various related genes that dramatically expressed in UC Model rats were downregulated by DS.

2023-11-20,37852423,"Design, Synthesis, anti-inflammatory activity Evaluation, preliminary exploration of the Mechanism, molecule Docking, and structure-activity relationship analysis of batatasin III analogs.","Most clinical drugs used to treat inflammation have serious gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular side effects during long-term treatment. The development of new anti-inflammatory agents from natural products and their derivatives is a powerful approach to overcome these adverse effects. Batatasin III, a bibenzyl natural product, has been found to have anti-inflammatory activity. Compared with other anti-inflammatory agents, batatasin III has a simple and unique structure. Therefore, batatasin III and its analogs might have the potential to treat inflammation with only mild adverse effects as a new type of anti-inflammatory agent. Herein, we synthesized 26 batatasin III analogs and evaluated the anti-inflammatory activity in vitro. Analog 21 significantly inhibited (p < 0.01) nitric oxide production with an IC50 value of 12.95 μM. Western blot analysis further revealed that 21 reduced iNOS, phosphorylated p65, and β-catenin expression in a concentration-dependent manner. These results indicated that 21 could be a potential lead compound for developing a drug candidate for ulcerative colitis. Molecular docking analysis showed that p65 might be a potential target of 21 for the treatment of inflammatory disease. In addition, we analyzed the structure-activity relationship of the analogs, which provides a basis for future structural modifications.",no,yes,no,in vitro,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3

Mobile apps represent a novel opportunity to provide self-management for patients with IBD. Many mobile apps have been developed for IBD self-management, but more evidence is needed about the quality of these mobile apps.This study evaluated mobile apps developed for the IBD community and rated the quality of these apps to provide a roadmap for future development.The Apple App Store and Google Play Store were systematically searched to identify IBD mobile apps for patients and physicians based on the IBD-related keywords. We included mobile apps that focus on IBD, are in the English language, and are free. The related app quality was evaluated independently by two reviewers using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS).We identified 401 mobile apps. After removing duplicates and unrelated apps, 44 apps were included in the review. Overall, the mean MARS scores were 3.5 (SD = 0.5) on a scale from 1.00 to 5.00, which was the acceptable range.; 12 apps got scores ≥ 4.00. The highest mean domain score belonged to the functionality dimension (mean = 3.9, SD = 0.6) and the lowest belonged to the engagement dimension (mean = 3.2, SD = 0.8).The MARS ratings showed that the IBD mobile apps quality meet acceptable criteria.

Existing interventions have been proven to have little effect. Ferroptosis is a newly discovered type of programmed cell death that has been found to be involved in the process of ischemia‒reperfusion in multiple organs throughout the body. Studies have shown that it is also present in retinal ischemia‒reperfusion injury. A rat model of retinal ischemia‒reperfusion injury was constructed and treated with deferoxamine. In this study, we found the accumulation of Fe2+, reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and the consumption of glutathione (GSH) via ELISA testing; increased expression of transferrin; and decreased expression of ferritin, SLC7A11, and GPX4 via Western blotting (WB) and real-time PCR testing. Structural signs of ferroptosis (mitochondrial shrinkage) were observed across multiple cell types, including retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), photoreceptor cells, and pigment epithelial cells. Changes in visual function were detected by F-VEP and ERG. The results showed that iron and oxidative stress were increased in the retinal ischemia‒reperfusion injury model, resulting in ferroptosis and tissue damage. Deferoxamine protects the structural and functional soundness of the retina by inhibiting ferroptosis through the simultaneous inhibition of hemochromatosis, the initiation of transferrin, and the degradation of ferritin and activating the antioxidant capacity of the System Xc-GSH-GPX4 pathway.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,retinopathy,3
2023-11-20,37978573,Interplay of gut microbiota and host epithelial mitochondrial dysfunction is necessary for the development of spontaneous intestinal inflammation in mice.,"Intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) mitochondrial dysfunction involvement in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease affecting the small intestine, is emerging in recent studies. As the interface between the self and the gut microbiota, IECs serve as hubs of bidirectional cross-talk between host and luminal microbiota. However, the role of mitochondrial-microbiota interaction in the ileum is largely unexplored. Prohibitin 1 (PHB1), a chaperone protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane required for optimal electron transport chain function, is decreased during IBD. We previously demonstrated that mice deficient in PHB1 specifically in IECs (Phb1i∆IEC) exhibited mitochondrial impairment, Paneth cell defects, gut microbiota dysbiosis, and spontaneous inflammation in the ileum (ileitis). Mice deficient in PHB1 in Paneth cells (epithelial secretory cells of the small intestine; Phb1∆PC) also exhibited mitochondrial impairment, Paneth cell defects, and spontaneous ileitis. Here, we determined whether this phenotype is driven by Phb1 deficiency-associated ileal microbiota alterations or direct effects of loss of PHB1 in host IECs.Depletion of gut microbiota by broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment in Phb1∆PC or Phb1i∆IEC mice revealed a necessary role of microbiota to cause ileitis. Using germ-free mice colonized with ileal microbiota from Phb1-deficient mice, we show that this microbiota could not independently induce ileitis without host mitochondrial dysfunction. The luminal microbiota phenotype of Phb1i∆IEC mice included a loss of the short-chain fatty acid butyrate. Supplementation of butyrate in Phb1-deficient mice ameliorated Paneth cell abnormalities and ileitis. Phb1-deficient ileal enteroid models suggest deleterious epithelial-intrinsic responses to ileal microbiota that were protected by butyrate.These results suggest a mutual and essential reinforcing interplay of gut microbiota and host IEC, including Paneth cell, mitochondrial health in influencing ileitis. Restoration of butyrate is a potential therapeutic option in Crohn's disease patients harboring epithelial cell mitochondrial dysfunction.

Left eye had a shallow retinal detachment for which he underwent belt buckling. The baby had an occipital skin tag. A provisional diagnosis of Stickler syndrome was made.On 1-month follow-up, left eye retina was attached and 360° laser barrage was done. Fluorescein angiography was done which revealed peripheral avascular retina in both eyes. MRI and genetic testing were suggestive of syndromic association. Genetic testing revealed pathogenic mutation in COL 18A1 suggestive of Knobloch syndrome in the baby, and both parents were found to be carriers of the same mutation. However, brain MRI showed features not pathognomonic of Knobloch syndrome.Although Knobloch syndrome is associated with vitreoretinal degeneration and high risk of retinal detachment, there seems to be no recommendation for prophylaxis in the other eye and therefore we preferred to observe the RE closely.

The effect of Brazilian Green Propolis in reducing ulcerative colitis in mice has already been described, as well as high amounts of the prenylated compound Artepellin C (ARC). The search for new pharmacological targets for IBD is also advancing. Among possibilities is the p21-activated kinase (PAK1), overexpressed and activated in the intestinal mucosa during IBD and colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). PAK 1 contributes to tissue inflammation by reducing the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor type γ (PPAR47) and increasing activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB. At least in vitro, inhibition of PAK1 has been reported to mitigate NF-κB-mediated inflammation in intestinal cells and ARC inhibits PAK1 activation. Given this pharmacological potential of ARC and the role of PAK1 in IBD and CAC, this perspective collected information that encourages future research to test the hypothesis that ARC can maintain intestinal integrity under the inflammatory and neoplastic stimulus and that inhibition of PAK1/NF-κB signaling and favoring PPAR-γ activity is pivotal in this action. Therefore, future studies employing in vitro and in vivo steps, using murine and human enterocytes and rodents submitted to ulcerative colitis and CAC models are incentivized by the data gathered here, favor retirar essas palavras: mostly in vitro studies, before clinical trials.

However, little was known about how orally administered or microbe-derived D-amino acids affected the gut microbial community or gut disease progression.The ratio of D- to L-amino acids was analyzed in feces and blood from patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and healthy controls. Also, composition of microbe was analyzed from patients with UC. Mice were treated with D-amino acid in dextran sulfate sodium colitis model and liver cholangitis model.The ratio of D- to L-amino acids was lower in the feces of patients with UC than that of healthy controls. Supplementation of D-amino acids ameliorated UC-related experimental colitis and liver cholangitis by inhibiting growth of Proteobacteria. Addition of D-alanine, a major building block for bacterial cell wall formation, to culture medium inhibited expression of the ftsZ gene required for cell fission in the Proteobacteria Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, thereby inhibiting growth. Overexpression of ftsZ restored growth of E. coli even when D-alanine was present. We found that D-alanine not only inhibited invasion of pathological K. pneumoniae into the host via pore formation in intestinal epithelial cells but also inhibited growth of E. coli and generation of antibiotic-resistant strains.D-amino acids might have potential for use in novel therapeutic approaches targeting Proteobacteria-associated dysbiosis and antibiotic-resistant bacterial diseases by means of their effects on the intestinal microbiota community.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety",,ulcerative colitis,3

The search yielded 59 citations, and 11 articles met all of the inclusion criteria. The panel methodologist then assigned a level of evidence rating for each study; 8 studies were rated level I evidence and 3 studies were rated level II evidence.All included studies evaluated a single 12-minute session using the LipiFlow automated thermal pulsation system (TearScience, Inc, or Johnson & Johnson). Improvements were detected in subjective and objective metrics of MGD or dry eye in patients within 1 to 12 months of thermal pulsation treatment compared with nontreatment. Most of the studies (9/11) reported greater efficacy with thermal pulsation than with standard warm compress therapy and eyelid hygiene. Four of these studies showed relevant industry conflicts of interest. Two of the 4 level I studies without direct industry participation concluded that thermal pulsation treatment was not significantly different from conventional hygiene or warm compress therapy control treatments (in symptoms in one of the studies and in objective findings in the second study). No serious adverse events were reported in any of the 11 studies.According to the current literature, a single thermal pulsation session may improve subjective or objective parameters of MGD and dry eye safely. However, industry support and participation were present in 4 of the 8 level I studies. The durability beyond several months and cost efficacy remain uncertain. Because the inclusion parameters of this assessment captured only the LipiFlow system, the conclusions are limited to that product.

The role of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in the treatment of UC is very complex. Kuijie decoction (KJD) as a classic TCM, is widely used in the clinical treatment of UC, but the mechanism of its action is still unclear.This study is to investigate the protective effects of KJD on UC and the underlying mechanisms.The experimental model of UC was induced by DSS, and KJD was introduced into the model at the same time. Clinical symptoms, including the body weight, colon length and colon histopathological, were used to measure the severity of colitis. The expression of inflammatory cytokines and tight junction proteins was quantified. The effect of KJD on intestinal flora and intestinal metabolism was determined by 16S rRNA and untargeted metabolomics analysis, respectively. The proportion of Th17 cells and Tregs in the spleen was examined by flow cytometry.Mice treated with KJD showed significantly alleviated clinical symptoms and histological damage, such as more body weight gain, lower disease activity index (DAI) score, and longer colon length. The administration of KJD also led to the down-regulation of inflammatory mediators, upregulation of the expression of ZO-1, occludin and decreased claudin-2, as well as altered microbiota composition against DSS challenges (especially an increase of Lachnospiraceae). KJD enhanced the percentage of Treg cells but decreased the proportion of Th17 cells to maintain intestinal homeostasis by improving gut microbiota metabolism.In summary, KJD maintained intestinal epithelial homeostasis by regulating epithelial barrier function, intestinal flora, and restoring Th17/Treg balance.

Nevertheless, the chemical composition, prototype, and metabolite constituents of DXT and its pharmacological mechanism of treatment for UC remain unclear.Necroptosis, a caspase-independent form of programmed cell death, plays a crucial role in the inflammatory pathogenesis of UC. The occurrence of necroptosis in intestinal epithelial cells triggers a robust inflammatory response and disrupts the integrity of both the mucinous barrier and tight junction construction. The objective of our study was to determine the chemical composition of DXT, identify its absorbed active ingredients and metabolites in rat serum, and investigate whether DXT possesses epithelial barrier protective effects by inhibiting necroptosis.First, the UPLC-Q-TOF/MS was applied to identify the chemical composition of DXT, as well as the absorption components and metabolites of DXT in rat serum. Second, the network pharmacology analysis was further investigated to elucidate the potential targets for treating UC. Finally, the mechanism of action was validated by necroptosis-based experiment in vitro and an in vivo model of colitis.A comprehensive analysis revealed the presence of 31 phytochemicals derived from DXT herb, as well as a total of 39 components in rat serum. Network pharmacology analysis indicated that TNF, EGFR, HSP90, etc. are the potential targets. Experimental in vitro and in vivo verified that the DXT could improve disease activity index, body weight, colon length and intestinal barrier permeability in mice with colitis by inhibiting necroptosis of intestinal epithelial cells.In this study, the phytochemicals derived from DXT herb and absorption active ingredients and metabolites of DXT in rat serum were analyzed.

The NLRP3 inflammasome, which is composed of NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1, plays a crucial role in UC pathogenesis by triggering the production of proinflammatory cytokines. In this study, we investigated the regulatory role of RNF31 in NLRP3 inflammasome activation during UC development. Through comprehensive analysis of ulcerative colitis tissues using the GEO database and immunohistochemistry, we found that RNF31 expression was elevated in UC tissues, which prompted further investigation into its function. We constructed an RNF31 knockdown cell model and observed a significant reduction in NLRP3 inflammasome activation, indicating the involvement of RNF31 in regulating NLRP3. Mechanistically, RNF31 could interact with NLRP3 through the RBR structural domain, leading to increased K63-linked ubiquitination of NLRP3 and consequent stabilization. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed a mutual interaction between RNF31 and NLRP3, substantiating their functional association. Finally, an in vivo mouse model with RNF31 knockdown showed a notable reduction in NLRP3 expression, which was accompanied by a decrease in the proinflammatory cytokines IL-18 and IL-1β. The successful attenuation of DSS-induced tissue inflammation by this treatment confirmed the physiological relevance of RNF31-mediated regulation of NLRP3.

Highly variable cell viability and functional recovery of RPE cells after cryopreservation are the most commonly encountered issues. In the present protocol, we aimed to achieve the best cell recovery rate after thawing by selecting the optimal cell phase for freezing based on the original experimental conditions. Cells were frozen in the exponential phase determined by using the 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine labeling assay, which improved cell viability and recovery rate after thawing. Stable and functional cells were obtained shortly after thawing, independent of a long differentiation process.

However, the specific effects and underlying mechanisms of XHP in treating colitis remain unknown.This study aimed to investigate the potential impact of XHP on colitis and uncover the underlying mechanisms involved.An acute colitis model was developed in C57BL/6N mice, and the effects on weight loss, colon length, the permeability of the colonic mucosa barrier, Claudin-5 and Occludin expression, number of both infiltrating MPO-positive cells and CD68-positive cells, and the content of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-22, IL-1β, and TNF-α) in the colon tissue were investigated. Low-, medium-, and high-dose XHP (0.45, 0.9, and 1.8 g/kg/day) (batch number: z21021222) were administered to the mice by gavage over the course of two weeks. Additionally, the protein expression levels in colon tissue from the control group, colitis group, and XHP low-dose administration group mice were analyzed by quantitative proteomics techniques. The comprehensive profiling and characterization of absorbed components in mice blood following oral administration of XHP were identified by HPLC/Q-TOF-MS techniques, and the absorbed components in blood were combined with proteomics to reveal the mechanism of enteritis inhibition by XHP.Our findings indicated that XHP enhanced weight loss and colonic shortening of colitis mice. Additionally, XHP reduced the increase in permeability of the colonic mucosa barrier and decreased expression of Claudin-5 and Occludin, while significantly reducing the number of infiltrating MPO-positive cells and CD68-positive cells in the colon tissue. We found that XHP reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-22, IL-1β, and TNF-α in colon tissue. Pharmacokinetic analysis suggested that XHP contained 24 blood-entering prototype ingredients, which improved colitis through the regulation of various proteins (e.g., Ctsb, Sting1, and Abat) linked to mucosal barrier injury and inflammation.XHP improved intestinal mucosal barrier injury and reduced MPO-positive cells and CD68-positive cell infiltration through multiple targets and pathways, providing support for XHP as a promising therapy for colitis.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3
2023-11-22,37689326,Panax notoginseng saponins alleviate diabetic retinopathy by inhibiting retinal inflammation: Association with the NF-κB signaling pathway.,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a neurovascular disease that causes blindness in adults and is the most serious and common complication of diabetes mellitus. Retinal inflammation is an early stage of DR, and it is believed to play a crucial role in the development of DR. Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) are the major active constituent in the main root of P. notoginseng, and they exhibit various biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, neuroprotective, and immunomodulatory functions. However, the protective effects and underlying mechanisms of PNS against DR remain unclear.This study aimed to investigate the alleviation effects of PNS on DR and the mechanisms involved. Furthermore, it intended to explore the major components that exert efficacy in vivo.Streptozotocin (STZ) was administered intraperitoneally to Sprague Dawley rats, and PNS was administered orally for 1 month after 2 months of STZ injection. The morphological structure of the retina and retinal acellular capillaries were assessed via hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining assay. The disruption of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) was detected through Evans blue dye leakage assay, and retinal leukocyte adhesion was achieved via fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled concanavalin A lectin labeling assay. Immunofluorescence staining and Western blot assays were conducted to detect the expression of tight junction proteins, adhesion molecules, and the ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule-1 (Iba-1) in the retina. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to detect the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1β in serum. In addition, the protein expression levels of nuclear factor (NF)-κB p65, phosphorylated IκB kinase (p-IKK), phosphorylated NF-κB inhibitor (p-IκB), and phosphorylated NF-κB p65 (p-p65) were measured using Western blot assay. The ocular tissue distribution of PNS in normal and diabetic rats was determined through ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The in vitro anti-inflammatory effects of PNS, notoginsenoside (NGR1), ginsenoside Rg1, Re, Rb1, and Rd (GRg1, GRe, GRb1, and GRd) were evaluated on human Müller (MIO-M1) cells.PNS increased the reduction in retinal inner nuclear layer thickness, reduced the increase in retinal acellular capillaries, and attenuated elevated BRB disruption by upregulating the decrease in protein expression of claudin-1 and occludin. Furthermore, PNS significantly abrogated microglial cell activation and reversed the increase in leukocyte adhesion by downregulating the increase in the protein expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. Moreover, PNS reduced the elevated levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β in serum and inhibited the increased protein expression of p-IKK, p-IκB, and p-p65, and the nuclear translocation of p65. The tissue distribution results revealed that NGR1, GRg1, GRe, GRb1, and GRd were detected in the ocular tissue, while GRg1 and GRb1 were found at the highest levels compared with the other components. The cellular results showed that PNS, NGR1, GRg1, GRe, GRb1, and GRd suppressed the development of cellular inflammatory responses by inhibiting the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway in MIO-M1 cells and that their anti-inflammatory effects were comparable.PNS suppressed retinal inflammation by inhibiting the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, alleviating DR. GRg1 and GRb1 may be the primary components that exert anti-inflammatory effects in vivo.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinopathy,3
2023-11-22,37722135,Blocking Hemopexin With Specific Antibodies: A New Strategy for Treating Diabetic Retinopathy.,"Hemopexin (HPX) is overexpressed in the retina of patients with diabetes and induces the breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier in vitro. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether HPX blockade by specific antibodies (aHPX) could avoid vascular leakage in vivo and microvascular angiogenesis in vitro and ex vivo. For this purpose, the effect of intravitreal (IVT) injections of aHPX on vascular leakage was evaluated in db/db mice and rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes using the Evans Blue method. Retinal neurodegeneration and inflammation were also evaluated. The antiangiogenic effect of aHPX on human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) was tested by scratch wound healing and tube formation using standardized methods, as well as by choroidal sprouting assays from retinal explants obtained in rats. We found that IVT injection of aHPX significantly reduced vascular leakage, retinal neurodegeneration, and inflammation. In addition, treatment with aHPX significantly reduced HREC migration and tube formation induced by high glucose concentration and suppressed choroidal sprouting even after vascular endothelial growth factor stimulation, with this effect being higher than obtained with bevacizumab. The antipermeability and antiangiogenic effects of IVT injection of aHPX suggest the blockade or inhibition of HPX as a new strategy for the treatment of advanced stages of diabetic retinopathy.Hemopexin (HPX) is the best-characterized permeability factor in steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome. We have previously reported that HPX is overexpressed in the retina of patients with diabetes and induces the breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier in vitro. Here, we report that intravitreal injection of anti-HPX antibodies significantly reduces vascular leakage, retinal neurodegeneration, and inflammation in diabetic murine models and that the immunoneutralization of HPX exerts a significant antiangiogenic effect in vitro and in retinal explants. The blockade of HPX can be considered as a new therapy for advanced stages of diabetic retinopathy.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety",,retinopathy,3

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to estimate the incidence of and identify the risk factors for CVA in patients with IBD.PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science were searched for articles published up to January 13, 2023 to identify those reported the incidence of CVA in IBD patients, along with the total person-years or related data to calculate it. The main outcomes were the incidence of and risk factors for CVA in IBD.Based on the analysis of 10 studies, the pooled incidence of CVA in IBD patients was 2.74 per 1000 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.83-4.10 person-years; I2  = 99.2%), which was higher than that in the general population (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.21, 95% CI 1.09-1.34, P = 0.0002; I2  = 84.8%). Risk factors for CVA in IBD patients were age (significance in different definitions), ulcerative colitis (IRR 1.214, 95% CI 1.000-1.474, P = 0.0499; I2  = 81.9%), disease flares (IRR 1.699, 95% CI 1.359-2.122, P < 0.0001; I2  = 28.7%) and chronic activity (IRR 2.202, 95% CI 1.378-3.519, P = 0.0010; I2  = 83.0%).The risk of CVA modestly increased in IBD patients. Both the traditional and IBD-related risk factors should be managed to prevent CVA in these patients. Since the effects of risk factors were derived from pooled results of only 2-3 studies, further research is needed to confirm our results.",no,yes,yes,other,"effectiveness, safety",,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",3
2023-11-22,37863414,IGF2/IGF2R/Sting signaling as a therapeutic target in DSS-induced ulcerative colitis.,"Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory bowel disease with increasing prevalence and incidence. Current treatments for ulcerative colitis are not generally applicative and are often accompanied by side effects. IGF2 is an endogenous protein that plays roles in anti-inflammation and stemness maintenance, but little is known about its mechanism and function in the progression of ulcerative colitis. In this study, mouse recombinant IGF2 was used in a mouse model of ulcerative colitis established by DSS. IGF2 expression was reduced in colon tissues but not plasma of DSS-induced colitis mice. IGF2R expression was also decreased in colitis colons, which was then elevated by recombinant IGF2. Recombinant IGF2 alleviated colon injury in colitis, which was evaluated by colon shortening, body weight loss and DAI score. IGF2 treatment also relieved the inflammatory response in colitis, which was assessed by the spleen weight index, MPO activity and proinflammatory cytokine expression and was also detected in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells in vitro. Moreover, IGF2R was predicted and further verified to interact with the Sting protein, and the cGAS-Sting pathway as a key pathway for stemness regulation, was upregulated in colonic colons, which was blocked by IGF2 treatment. Additionally, IGF2 treatment can maintain colonic stemness and further repair colonic tight junction function in DSS-induced colitis. In conclusion, IGF2/IGF2R downregulated the cGAS-Sting pathway to sustain colonic stemness and barrier integrity to protect against ulcerative colitis induced by DSS.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety",,ulcerative colitis,3
2023-11-22,37986255,Professor ,"The academic thoughts of professor GAO Wei-bin regarding the use of electroacupuncture in the treatment of dry eye are introduced. Professor GAO believes that the occurrence of dry eye is mainly related to the stagnation of qi and blood in the eye meridians, leading to inadequate nourishment of the eyes. The acupuncture treatment principle focuses on promoting blood circulation, clearing and benefiting the eye orifices. By integrating traditional acupuncture theory with modern neuroanatomy, the treatment approach centers on stimulating the lacrimal gland, emphasizing the importance of promoting, addressing symptoms as a priority, and considering both the root cause and symptoms.The precise acupoint selection is emphasized. Acupoints of periocular region, such as Taiyang (EX-HN 5) and Leixian point are selected along with Fengchi (GB 20) and Gongxue point to treat dry eye. Attention is also given to the use of electroacupuncture and the selection of its frequencies, emphasizing specific needling techniques based on the severity and classification of the disease.",no,yes,no,other,effectiveness,,dry eye,3
2023-11-23,37537878,A Biomimetic Nanoplatform with Improved Inflammatory Targeting Behavior for ROS Scavenging-Based Treatment of Ulcerative Colitis.,"Ulcerative colitis (UC), a refractory disease, has become a global problem. Herein, a biomimetic nanoplatform (AU-LIP-CM) comprising Au cluster enzymes (AU)-loaded liposomes (AU-LIP) camouflaged with the fusion membrane (CM) consisting of neutrophil (NC) and red blood cell (RBC) membrane is designed for the treatment of UC. Briefly, revealed by second near-infrared (NIR-II) imaging through collection of fluorescence emitting >1200 nm from AU, the improved inflammatory targeting behavior contributed by CM cloaking, which inherits abilities of inflammatory targeting and immune escape from NC and RBC, respectively, promotes specific accumulation of AU within inflammatory intestines with up to ≈11.5 times higher than that of bare AU. Afterward, AU possessing superoxide dismutase- and catalase-like activities realizes high-efficiency scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to repair of intestinal barriers, regulation of the immune system, and modulation of gut microbiota, which surpass first-line UC drug. In addition, study of underlying therapeutic mechanism demonstrated that the treatment with AU-LIP-CM can alter the gene signature associated with response to ROS for UC mice to a profile similar to that of healthy mice, deciphering related signal pathways. The strategy developed here provides insights of learning from properties of natural bio-substances to empower biomimetic nanoplatform to confront diseases.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3
2023-11-23,37676657,MAdCAM-1 targeting strategy can prevent colitic cancer carcinogenesis and progression via suppression of immune cell infiltration and inflammatory signals.,"Chronic inflammation caused by infiltrating immune cells can promote colitis-associated dysplasia/colitic cancer in ulcerative colitis (UC) by activating inflammatory cytokine signalling through the IL-6/p-STAT3 and TNFα/NF-κB pathways. Mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) expressed on high endothelial venules promotes the migration of immune cells from the bloodstream to the gut via interaction with α4β7 integrin expressed on the immune cells. MAdCAM-1, has therefore drawn interest as a novel therapeutic target for treating active UC. However, the role of MAdCAM-1-positive endothelial cells in immune cell infiltration in dysplasia/colitic cancers remains unclear. We evaluated the expression of MAdCAM-1, CD31 and immune cell markers (CD8, CD68, CD163 and FOXP3) in samples surgically resected from 11 UC patients with dysplasia/colitic cancer and 17 patients with sporadic colorectal cancer (SCRC), using immunohistochemical staining. We used an azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulphate mouse model (AOM/DSS mouse) to evaluate whether dysplasia/colitic cancer could be suppressed with an anti-MAdCAM-1 blocking antibody by preventing immune cell infiltration. The number of MAdCAM-1-positive vessels and infiltrating CD8+ , CD68+ and CD163+ immune cells was significantly higher in dysplasia/colitic cancer than in normal, SCRC and UC mucosa. In AOM/DSS mice, the anti-MAdCAM-1 antibody reduced the number, mean diameter, depth of tumours, Ki67 positivity, number of CD8+ , CD68+ and CD163+ immune cells and the IL-6/p-STAT3 and TNF-α/NF-κB signalling. Our results indicate that targeting MAdCAM-1 is a promising strategy for controlling not only UC severity but also carcinogenesis and tumour progression by regulating inflammation/immune cell infiltration in patients with UC.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3
2023-11-23,37918204,Targeting non-muscle myosin II inhibits proliferative vitreoretinopathy through regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition.,"Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is a common complication of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, eventually leading to vision loss. To date, there are no effective drugs for the treatment of this disease. In this study, we investigated the effect of blebbistatin, a non-muscle myosin II inhibitor, on the ARPE-19 cell line and in a rabbit model of proliferative vitreoretinopathy. In vitro, we found that blebbistatin inhibited the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and inhibited the ability of RPE cells to migrate, proliferate, generate extracellular matrix, and affect contractility. In vivo the PVR model showed that blebbistatin significantly delayed PVR progression. It also partially prevents the loss of retinal function caused by PVR.

2023-11-23,37933706,Novel pharmaceuticals for the management of retinal vein occlusion and linked disorders.,"Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is the second leading cause of blindness from retinal vascular disease behind diabetic retinopathy. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and glucocorticoid therapy are the cornerstones of pharmaceutical treatment for RVO. There is considerable interest in developing new pharmaceuticals in and out of these two classes to reduce costs, lower injection burden, and treat the occlusion itself, rather than the complications.In this review, we discuss novel pharmaceuticals for the treatment of RVO outside of current standard of care. We performed a comprehensive literature search encompassing pharmaceuticals that have recently been approved or have shown promising results in early clinical trials or animal models.Anti-VEGF therapy remains the most efficacious treatment for RVO with a very favorable side effect profile. New biosimilars reduce costs while maintaining efficacy. Novel glucocorticoids may be a useful therapy in patients for whom anti-VEGF therapy has failed, or as an adjunct. Pharmaceuticals in other drug classes, particularly those with neuroprotective or regenerative properties, as well as those geared toward treating the occlusion itself, represent exciting options for early RVO therapy, but are likely years away from clinical relevance.",no,yes,no,other,"effectiveness, safety",,retinal disease,3

The Ocular Trauma Score (OTS) is the most widely recognized tool for predicting visual outcomes. This review aimed to identify prognostic factors and assess the effectiveness of the OTS in predicting visual outcomes. Twenty-one articles published on PubMed and Google Scholar were analyzed. Initial visual acuity and the zone of injury were found to be the most significant prognostic factors for OGI. Other significant prognostic factors include retinal detachment/involvement, relative afferent pupillary defect, vitreous hemorrhage, vitreous prolapse, type of injury, hyphema, lens involvement, and duration from incidence of OGI to vitrectomy. Of the 21 studies evaluated, 11 investigated the effectiveness of OTS. Four studies concluded that OTS was effective overall, while six studies suggested that it was only useful in certain OGI categories.

In addition, fundus photography, ERG, and OCT were performed. A DNA-marker-based association analysis was performed to screen potential candidate genes and the whole genomes of four animals were sequenced.Initial fundus changes were pale papilla and mild vascular attenuation. Oscillatory nystagmus was noted in 14 of 16 clinically affected puppies. Vision was impaired under both scotopic and photopic conditions. Rod-mediated ERGs were unrecordable in all affected dogs tested, reduced cone-mediated responses were present in one animal at 3 months of age and unrecordable in the other affected animals tested. Multiple small retinal bullae were observed in three clinically affected animals (two with confirmed genetic diagnosis). OCT showed that despite loss of function, retinal structure was initially well-preserved, although a slight retinal thinning developed in older animals with the ventral retina being more severely affected. Pedigree analysis supported an autosomal recessive inheritance. A mutation was identified in GUCY2D, which segregated with the disease (NM_001003207.1:c.1598_1599insT; p.(Ser534GlufsTer20)). Human subjects with GUCY2D mutations typically show an initial disconnect between loss of function and loss of structure, a feature recapitulated in the affected dogs in this study.We identified early-onset PRA in the German Spitz associated with a frameshift mutation in GUCY2D.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinal disease,3

Indigo naturalis is highly effective against ulcerative colitis, but its mechanism is unclear. This study found that indigo naturalis treatment suppressed ferroptosis.We analyzed 770 mRNA expressions of patients with ulcerative colitis. Suppression of ferroptosis by indigo naturalis treatment was shown using a cell death assay. Malondialdehyde levels and reactive oxygen species were analyzed in CaCo-2 cells treated with indigo naturalis. Glutathione metabolism was shown by metabolomic analysis. Extraction of the ingredients indigo naturalis from the rectal mucosa was performed using liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry.Gene expression profiling showed that indigo naturalis treatment increased antioxidant genes in the mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis. In vitro analysis showed that nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2-related antioxidant gene expression was upregulated by indigo naturalis. Indigo naturalis treatment rendered cells resistant to ferroptosis. Metabolomic analysis suggested that an increase in reduced glutathione by indigo naturalis. The protein expression of CYP1A1 and GPX4 was increased in the rectum by treatment with indigo naturalis. The main ingredients of indigo naturalis, indirubin and indigo inhibited ferroptosis. Indirubin was detected in the rectal mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis who were treated with indigo naturalis.Suppression of ferroptosis by indigo naturalis in the intestinal epithelium could be therapeutic target for ulcerative colitis.

Ex vivo organoids derived from the intestinal epithelium are a useful model to study IBD. Whether such cultures can be established from surgically resected diseased IBD intestinal tissues has not been fully explored. In this study, we tested our ability to establish organoids from nondiseased and diseased IBD intestinal tissues.From 12 UC patients (n = 54 tissues) and 20 CD patients (n = 49 tissues), tissues were collected from multiple colonic regions, and for CD, the terminal ileum was also surveyed. Organoids were cultured in Matrigel domes using defined media. In primary tissues, we conducted immunohistochemical analysis for mucin 2 (MUC2) and Alcian blue staining for goblet cells. Organoids were stained for Ki67, E-cadherin, and MUC2.For UC, we were highly successful establishing organoids from nondiseased tissue (n = 12 of 13, 92%). This success rates dropped from tissues with mild (n = 6 of 9, 67%), moderate (n = 2 of 9, 22%), or severe disease (n = 1 of 23, 4%). The rates from nondiseased CD tissues were reduced (n = 11 of 23, 48%) in comparison to such tissues from UC patients. In UC, goblet cells and MUC2 were reduced in diseased tissues and these phenotypes were retained in organoids.Organoids can be readily derived from nondiseased surgically resected IBD tissues.

This study showed that fiber-deficient diet (FD) increased the susceptibility of mice to low dosage of DSS-induced UC, and a UC model was established by feeding mice with DSS and FD to evaluate the effect of Scytosiphon lomentaria fucoidan (SLF) on UC. SLF ameliorated the symptoms of UC, as evidenced by increases in colon length, goblet cells and glycoprotein and reduction in inflammatory cell infiltration and intestinal epithelial injury. SLF alleviated oxidative stress and inhibited colonic inflammation by reducing the levels of lipopolysaccharides and pro-inflammatory cytokines and suppressing the activation of nuclear factor kappa B pathway. SLF protected tight junction integrity by reducing the level of myosin light chain kinase and increasing the levels of claudin, zonula occludens-1 and occludin. SLF improved serum metabolites profile and affected multiple metabolic pathways that are crucial to human health, e.g. butanoate metabolism. The underlying mechanism can be associated with modulation of the gut microbiota and metabolites, including increases in short chain fatty acids and reduction in Proteobacteria, Bacteroides and Romboutsia.

Selenium nanoparticles (Se NPs) have demonstrated promising potential to alleviate UC symptoms, however, their poor solubility and stability leading to aggregation and large precipitates have significantly limit their clinical application. In this study, we aimed to enhance the performance of Se NPs by functionalizing them with Porphyra haitanensis polysaccharide, yielding PHP-Se NPs. As expected, these PHP-Se NPs exhibited reduced particle size (70.51 ± 2.92 nm), enhanced cellular uptake compared to native Se NPs, and preferential accumulation in the colonic tissue, providing targeted UC treatment. In vivo animal experiments revealed that PHP-Se NPs significantly improved weight loss, shortened colon length, and higher disease activity index (DAI) scores in DSS-induced UC mice. Moreover, PHP-Se NPs significantly inhibited the levels of inflammatory factors in colitis tissues and oxidative stress in serum of UC mice, improved histological damage in colitis tissues, and restored the intestinal mucosal barrier. Taken together, our study offers an innovative approach to augment the bioavailability of Se NPs, presenting a promising strategy for the effective prevention and management of UC.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety",,ulcerative colitis,3

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) may represent one of them. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of HBO therapy in an experimental model of IBD.Sixty male BALBc mice were divided into six groups. Group 1 was colitis-induced with trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) + ethanol, group 2 received TNBS + ethanol plus HBO, group 3 received only ethanol, group 4 received ethanol plus HBO, group 5 received saline solution, and group 6 received saline solution plus HBO. HBO was performed for four days, subsequently, the mice were evaluated daily. At the end of the study, samples from the intestine were collected for histological analysis as well as for measurement of antioxidant enzymes and cytokine levels.HBO significantly improved the clinical and histological status of the animals. Treatment with HBO increased the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in all of the groups; moreover, the difference was only significant between the TNBS and TNBS + HBO groups and treatments promoted a reduction in the proinflammatory cytokines IFN-γ, IL-12, IL-17 and TNF-α and increased the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10, with no changes in IL-13.HBO effectively treats TNBS-induced colitis by increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes and modulating cytokine profiles.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,crohn's disease,3

The risk is compounded when operating on monocular patients. We developed a novel technique using hyaloidal removal and minimal relaxing membranectomies for tractional retinal detachments with an opacified hyaloid over the fovea in monocular, diabetic patients and evaluated complications and outcomes.The technique was performed in nine monocular, diabetic patients with decreased visual acuity from opaque hyaloid with centripetal tractional retinal detachments. Outcomes included postoperative best-corrected visual acuity, retinal reattachment rate, redetachments, and complications.Average age was 58 years (range 43-74) and the average follow-up time was 43.6 months (range 36-64). Preoperative best-corrected visual acuity ranged from 1.0 to 2.3 logMAR (20/200 - Hand Motion) with a mean of 1.39 logMAR (20/500). Postoperative best-corrected visual acuity at last follow-up ranged from 0.2 to 1.0 logMAR (20/30-20/200) with a mean of 0.49 logMAR (20/60) ( P < 0.001). All eyes had attached posterior poles at last follow-up.

We have examined the contribution of 'avoidable' blinding disorders to childhood visual impairment, severe visual impairment and blindness (VI/SVIBL) in the UK.National prospective observational longitudinal study, the British Childhood Visual Impairment and Blindness Study 2 (BCVIS2), of children (aged 18 years or under) newly diagnosed with vision worse than 0.48 logMAR (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) or equivalent in both eyes. Proportions of children with an 'avoidable' disorder comprising either a potentially preventable (isolated disorders with an effective intervention which reduces disease incidence) or treatable (isolated eye or vision disorders for which there are routinely available effective interventions able to improve vision or halt progressive visual loss) are reported.Of the 784 children within BCVIS2, isolated potentially preventable disorders were present in only 17% (132/784) and treatable disorders in an additional 13% (99/784). The most common treatable causes were cataract, retinopathy of prematurity and glaucoma. Of the 132 children with potentially preventable disease, 64 had hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy. Non-accidental injury accounted for almost two-thirds (11/16, 69%) of those with VI/SVIBL due to injury.Despite significant progress in the past decades in high-income countries, there remains a need to be vigilant about implementing preventive strategies and treatments. Attention to disorders that are currently neither preventable nor treatable remains a priority in these settings and will become increasingly important in lower-income and middle-income countries undergoing economic transition.",no,yes,no,other,"effectiveness, safety",,retinopathy,3

Clinical data, including details of ophthalmological examinations and radiation treatment were reviewed.The study included 23 patients, 15 males and 8 females, with median age 51 years. Twenty patients (87%) received intensity-modulated proton therapy; 3 (13%) received intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Nineteen patients (83%) received concurrent chemotherapy. After a median follow-up time of 37 months (range: 8-83), 13 patients (57%) had best-corrected visual acuity 20/40 or better, 3 (13%) had moderate vision loss (between 20/40 and 20/200) and 7 (30%) had severe vision loss (20/200 or worse). The most common ocular complications were dry eye disease (21 patients; 91%), radiation retinopathy (16; 70%) and cataract progression (11; 49%). Tumour crossing the orbital midline (p=0.014) and Hispanic ethnicity (p=0.014) were associated with increased risk of severe vision loss. The risk of radiation retinopathy was significantly different among the three racial groups; Hispanic patients (n=3) had the highest rate of retinopathy (p<0.001). Tumour size, initial T category and total prescribed radiation dose were not significantly associated with severe vision loss.Eye-sparing surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy in patients with lacrimal gland carcinoma has a reasonable overall visual prognosis.

2023-11-27,36803681,Optimizing treatment of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis: CU-forum Delphi consensus.,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) clinical guidelines include the best available evidence, although not all clinical situations are answered, so their management can be controversial. The aim of this study is to identify the situations of mild to moderate UC susceptible to controversy and to evaluate the degree of agreement or disagreement with specific proposals.Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) expert discussion meetings were used to identify criteria, attitudes and opinions regarding the management of UC. A Delphi questionnaire was then developed with 60 items regarding antibiotics, salicylates and probiotics; local, systemic and topical corticosteroids; and immunosuppressants.Consensus was reached in 44 statements (73.3%); 32 in agreement (53.3%) and 12 in disagreement (20.0%). Some of them were: it is not necessary the systematic use of antibiotics despite the severity of the outbreak, being reserved when there is suspicion of infection or systemic toxicity; when faced with a mild-moderate outbreak of UC and in patients who do not respond to aminosalicylates, it is appropriate to use a dose of beclomethasone of 10mg/day for one month and 5mg/day for another month; it is advised that the dose of azathioprine be administered in a single dose.IBD experts agree on most of the proposals identified for managing mild to moderate UC and there is a need for scientific evidence in some specific situations where expert opinion may be helpful.",no,yes,no,other,effectiveness,,ulcerative colitis,3
2023-11-27,36907969,Retinal Ganglion Cells in a Dish: Current Strategies and Recommended Best Practices for Effective In Vitro Modeling of Development and Disease.,"The ability to derive retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) provides an extraordinary opportunity to study the development of RGCs as well as cellular mechanisms underlying their degeneration in optic neuropathies. In the past several years, multiple approaches have been established that allow for the generation of RGCs from hPSCs, with these methods greatly improved in more recent studies to yield mature RGCs that more faithfully recapitulate phenotypes within the eye. Nevertheless, numerous differences still remain between hPSC-RGCs and those found within the human eye, with these differences likely explained at least in part due to the environment in which hPSC-RGCs are grown. With the ultimate goal of generating hPSC-RGCs that most closely resemble those within the retina for proper studies of retinal development, disease modeling, as well as cellular replacement, we review within this manuscript the current effective approaches for the differentiation of hPSC-RGCs, as well as how they have been applied for the investigation of RGC neurodegenerative diseases such as glaucoma. Furthermore, we provide our opinions on the characteristics of RGCs necessary for their use as effective in vitro disease models and importantly, how these current systems should be improved to more accurately reflect disease states. The establishment of characteristics in differentiated hPSC-RGCs that more effectively mimic RGCs within the retina will not only enable their use as effective models of RGC development, but will also create a better disease model for the identification of mechanisms underlying the neurodegeneration of RGCs in disease states such as glaucoma, further facilitating the development of therapeutic approaches to rescue RGCs from degeneration in disease states.",no,yes,no,in vitro,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinal disease,3
2023-11-27,36927170,A paradigm shift in the treatment of refractory angle closure glaucoma in a patient with X-linked juvenile retinoschisis.,"X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS) is a rare inherited bilateral retinal degeneration caused by mutations in RS1 gene, occurring exclusively in men. Various ocular complications associated with XLRS are reported, and angle closure glaucoma in these eyes is one such complication that is refractory and needs surgery for intraocular pressure control. Glaucoma surgery in these eyes often results in refractory malignant glaucoma with its serious sequelae. Several surgical modifications to prevent this complication have been tried with no or limited success.In this report, we present a case of XLRS in a young male with a 22-year follow-up. We have described the natural history and progression of retinal disease and glaucoma.Refractory angle closure glaucoma in our patient was treated with core vitrectomy, phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation, and irido-zonulo-hyaloido-vitrectomy. This helped in successful deepening of anterior chamber, good IOP control, and preventing malignant glaucoma.Our case highlights the role of vitrectomy in managing the secondary angle closure glaucoma in eyes with X-LRS.",no,yes,no,other,"effectiveness, safety",,retinal disease,3
2023-11-27,37018534,A Detailed Review of Molecular Pathways and Mechanisms Responsible for the Development and Aggravation of Neuropathy and Nephropathy in Diabetes.,"Diabetic mellitus is responsible for triggering many conditions, such as neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy. Hyperglycemia leads to the development of oxidative stress conditions, activation of pathways, and generation of metabolites, leading to complications like neuropathy and nephropathy.This paper aims to discuss the mechanism of actions, pathways, and metabolites triggered due to the development of neuropathy and nephropathy post-long-haul diabetes in patients. The therapeutic targets are also highlighted, proving to be a potential cure for such conditions.Research works were searched from international and national databases with keywords like ""diabetes,"" ""diabetic nephropathy,"" ""NADPH,"" ""oxidative stress,"" ""PKC,"" ""Molecular mechanisms,"" "" cellular mechanisms,"" ""complications of diabetes,"" and ""factors."" The databases searched were PubMed, Scopus, Directory of open access journals, Semantic Scholar, Core, Europe PMC, EMBASE, Nutrition, FSTA- Food Science and Technology, Merck Index, Google Scholar, PubMed, Science Open, MedlinePlus, Indian citation index, World Wide Science, and Shodhganga.Pathways causing protein kinase C (PKC) activation, free radical injury, oxidative stress, and aggravating the conditions of neuropathy and nephropathy were discussed. In diabetic neuropathy and nephropathy, neurons and nephrons are affected to the extent that their normal physiology is disturbed, thus leading to further complications and conditions of loss of nerve sensation in diabetic neuropathy and kidney failure in diabetic nephropathy. Current treatment options available for the management of diabetic neuropathy are anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and topical medications, including capsaicin. According to AAN guidelines, pregabalin is recommended as the first line of therapy, whereas other drugs currently used for treatment are gabapentin, venlafaxine, opioids, amitriptyline, and valproate. Drug targets for treating diabetic neuropathy must suppress the activated polyol pathways, kinase C, hexosamine, and other pathways, which amplify neuroinflammation. Targeted therapy must focus on the reduction of oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokines and suppression of neuroinflammation, NF-κB, AP-1, etc. Conclusion: Potential drug targets must be considered for new research on the treatment of neuropathy and nephropathy conditions.",no,yes,no,other,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinopathy,3

Thus, we explored the mechanisms of action of ontamalimab and compared it to the anti-α4β7 antibody vedolizumab.We studied MAdCAM-1 expression with RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry. The mechanisms of action of ontamalimab were assessed with fluorescence microscopy, dynamic adhesion and rolling assays. We performed in vivo cell trafficking studies in mice and compared ontamalimab and vedolizumab surrogate [-s] antibodies in experimental models of colitis and wound healing. We analysed immune cell infiltration under anti-MAdCAM-1 and anti-α4β7 treatment by single-cell transcriptomics and studied compensatory trafficking pathways.MAdCAM-1 expression was increased in active inflammatory bowel disease. Binding of ontamalimab to MAdCAM-1 induced the internalization of the complex. Functionally, ontamalimab blocked T cell adhesion similar to vedolizumab, but also inhibited L-selectin-dependent rolling of innate and adaptive immune cells. Despite conserved mechanisms in mice, the impact of ontamalimab-s and vedolizumab-s on experimental colitis and wound healing was similar. Single-cell RNA sequencing demonstrated enrichment of ontamalimab-s-treated lamina propria cells in specific clusters, and in vitro experiments indicated that redundant adhesion pathways are active in these cells.Ontamalimab has unique and broader mechanisms of action compared to vedolizumab. However, this seems to be compensated for by redundant cell trafficking circuits and leads to similar preclinical efficacy of anti-α4β7 and anti-MAdCAM-1 treatment. These results will be important for the interpretation of pending phase III data.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3
2023-11-27,37220886,Patient and Public Involvement in Research: Lessons for Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Participatory research, also referred to as patient and public involvement, is an approach that involves collaborating with patients affected by the focus of the research, on the design, development and delivery of research to improve outcomes. There are two broad justifications for this: first, that it enhances the quality and relevance of research, and second, that it satisfies the ethical argument for patient inclusion in decisions about them. This synergistic and collaborative effort, which bridges the divide between researchers and participants with the lived condition, is now a mainstream activity and widely accepted as best practice. Although there has been a substantial increase in the literature over the past two decades, little has been published on how participatory research has been used in inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] research and little guidance as to how researchers should go about this. With an increasing incidence and prevalence worldwide, combined with declining study enrolment in an era of perennial unmet need, there are a multitude of benefits of participatory research to IBD patients and investigators, including research output that is informed and relevant to the real world. A key example of participatory research in IBD is the I-CARE study, a large-scale, pan-European observational study assessing the safety of advanced therapies, which had significant patient involvement throughout the study. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the benefits and challenges of participatory research and discuss opportunities of building strategic alliances between IBD patients, healthcare providers and academics to strengthen research outcomes.",no,yes,no,other,"effectiveness, safety",,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",3

The long-term outcomes of AIP and IBD in patients with coexisting AIP-IBD and predictors of complicated AIP course have rarely been reported.An ECCO COllaborative Network For Exceptionally Rare case reports project [ECCO-CONFER] collected cases of AIP diagnosed in patients with IBD. Complicated AIP was defined as a composite of endocrine and/or exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and/or pancreatic cancer. We explored factors associated with complicated AIP in IBD.We included 96 patients [53% males, 79% ulcerative colitis, 72% type 2 AIP, age at AIP diagnosis 35 ± 16 years]. The majority of Crohn's disease [CD] cases [78%] had colonic/ileocolonic involvement. In 59%, IBD preceded AIP diagnosis, whereas 18% were diagnosed simultaneously. Advanced therapy to control IBD was used in 61% and 17% underwent IBD-related surgery. In total, 82% of patients were treated with steroids for AIP, the majority of whom [91%] responded to a single course of treatment. During a mean follow-up of 7 years, AIP complications occurred in 25/96 [26%] individuals. In a multivariate model, older age at AIP diagnosis was associated with a complicated AIP course (odds ratio [OR] = 1.05, p = 0.008), whereas family history of IBD [OR = 0.1, p = 0.03], and CD diagnosis [OR = 0.2, p = 0.04] decreased the risk of AIP complications. No IBD- or AIP-related deaths occurred.In this large international cohort of patients with concomitant AIP-IBD, most patients have type 2 AIP and colonic IBD. AIP course is relatively benign and long-term outcomes are favourable, but one-quarter develop pancreatic complications.

Activation of HIF by HIF-PHIs effectively increases hemoglobin (Hb) level in CKD patients by inducing multiple HIF downstream signaling pathways. This indicates that HIF-PHIs have effects beyond erythropoietin, while their potential benefits and risks should be necessarily assessed. Multiple clinical trials have largely demonstrated the efficacy and safety of HIF-PHIs in the short-term treatment of anemia. However, in terms of long-term administration, especially over 1 year, the benefits and risks of HIF-PHIs still need to be assessed. Particular attention should be paid to the risk of kidney disease progression, cardiovascular events, retinal diseases, and tumor risk. This review aims to summarize the current potential risks and benefits of HIF-PHIs in CKD patients with anemia and further discuss the mechanism of action and pharmacological properties of HIF-PHIs, in order to provide direction and theoretical support for future studies.",no,yes,yes,other,"effectiveness, safety",,retinal disease,3

However, its potential therapeutic effect of ginsenoside RT4 on ulcerative colitis remains unknown.In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of ginsenoside RT4 and its underlying molecular mechanism in the treatment of ulcerative colitis mice induced with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Our results demonstrate that ginsenoside RT4 effectively reduced weight, shortening of colonic tract length, colonic bowel damage, and disease activity index (DAI) scores in DSS-induced colitis mice. Additionally, ginsenoside RT4 regulates miR-144-3p expression in DSS-induced colitis mice, and we further confirmed that the solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) was the target gene of miR-144-3p by database analysis. Finally, ginsenoside RT4 inhibits the activation of the miR-144-3p/SLC7A11 signaling pathway, which alleviates colitis. Ginsenoside RT4 significantly decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β and increased the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.These findings suggest that ginsenoside RT4 may have therapeutic potential for treating ulcerative colitis by downregulating levels of miR-144-3p/SLC7A11 signaling pathway, which are expected to be useful in treating clinical ulcerative colitis.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3

We focus on phenylacetylglutamine [PAGln], a diet-derived meta-organismal prothrombotic metabolite.We collected faecal and serum samples from a CD cohort [n = 136] and healthy controls [n = 126] prior to treatment, and quantified serum PAGln using LC-MS/MS. Diet was assessed using food-frequency questionnaires. Mice [C57BL/6] were fed high/low-protein diets and administered dextran sodium sulphate [DSS] to examine plasma PAGly, thrombosis potential, and colitis severity. PAGly or saline was administered to DSS-induced colitis mice, and colitis severity and colonic tissue gene expression were examined. P-selectin and CD40L expression were determined in human platelet-rich plasma [n = 5-6] after exposure to platelet agonists following PAGln priming. Bioinformatic analysis and bacterial culturing identified the main contributor of PAGln in CD.PAGln, a meta-organismal prothrombotic metabolite, is associated with CD. Administration of PAGly exacerbated colitis in a mouse model and upregulated coagulation-related biological processes. Antiplatelet medicine, dipyridamole, attenuated PAGly-enhanced colitis susceptibility. PAGln enhanced platelet activation and CD40L expression in platelet-rich plasma ex vivo. Further study revealed that high dietary protein intake and increased abundance of phenylacetic acid [PAA]-producing Proteobacteria mediated by phenylpyruvate decarboxylase act in concert to cause the elevated PAGln levels in CD patients.Taken together, ppdc-carrying Proteobacteria-generated PAGln from dietary protein is associated with CD and exacerbates colitis possibly via platelet-induced coagulation and inflammation These results suggest that PAGln is a potential early diagnostic marker and therapeutic target of CD.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,crohn's disease,3

This technique was evaluated to prevent retinal slippage.Five consecutive cases were evaluated. The mean GRT size was 174° (range, 90-240°) and the GRT was located temporally in two eyes, nasally in two eyes, and superiorly in one eye. The tamponade types were air (1 eye), sulfur hexafluoride (3 eyes), and perfluoropropane (1 eye). Our technique was feasible and the slippage did not occur in any eyes. Although the microscope needed to be tilted for optimal fundus visualization, heads-up surgery allowed surgeons to maintain ergonomic postures.

However, the peeling of LHEP is often technically challenging. We have developed a new technique using a backflush needle with a silicone tip cannula that seems safer and more effective for use in LHEP embedding.A 25-gauge vitrectomy system with an enhancing visual acuity system (D.O.R.C., Zuidland, Netherlands) was used in all cases. After core vitrectomy, triamcinolone acetonide (Wakamoto Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was used to visualize the membrane. A 25-gauge backflush needle with a silicone tip cannula was used to remove the thin preretinal membrane centripetally, leaving an LHEP on the edge of the hole. Brilliant Blue G (internal limiting membrane Blue; D.O.R.C.) was then used to stain the internal limiting membrane.This technique was used in six eyes with lamellar macular holes. In all cases, peeling and embedding of the LHEP was effectively performed without damaging the internal limiting membrane or causing retinal hemorrhage. No other intraoperative or postoperative complications were experienced.Using a silicone-tipped backflush needle with passive aspiration was a simple and effective technique for peeling and embedding of LHEPs in this small series.",no,yes,no,other,"effectiveness, safety",,retinal disease,3

We assessed IBD hospitalizations and surgical operations in Washington State to characterize regionalization patterns.We identified a cohort of hospitalizations for Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) from 2008 to 2019 using Washington State's Comprehensive Hospital Abstract Reporting System (CHARS). Hospitalizations were characterized by emergent or elective acuity and whether an operation or endoscopic procedure was performed. Facility volume and distance travelled by patients were used to determine regionalization.There were 20,494 IBD-related hospitalizations at 95 hospitals: 13,585 (66.3%) with CD and 6,909 (33.7%) with UC. Emergencies accounted for 78.2% of all IBD-related hospitalizations and did not differ between CD (78.3%) and UC (77.9%) (p = 0.54). Surgery was performed during 10.3% and endoscopy during 30.6% of emergent hospitalizations. 72.0% of emergent hospitalizations occurred at 22 facilities, while 71.1% of elective hospitalizations were concentrated at 9 facilities. Operations were performed during 78.5% of elective hospitalizations, and five hospitals performed 69% of all elective surgery. Laparoscopic surgery increased in both emergent (17% to 52%, p < 0.001) and elective operations (18% to 42%, p < 0.001) from 2008 to 2019.In Washington State, most IBD hospitalizations were emergent, which were decentralized and typically non-operative.

Herein, it reports the development of a novel nanoparticle system, called ROS-CA-NPs, which is formed using polymer-cinnamaldehyde (CA) conjugates and is responsive to reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS-CA-NPs exhibit excellent drug stability, tissue selectivity, and controlled drug release upon oxidative stress activation. Using mouse models of chronic rheumatoid arthritis and acute ulcerative colitis, this study demonstrates that the systemic administration of ROS-CA-NPs results in their accumulation at inflamed lesions and leads to greater therapeutic efficacy compared to traditional drugs. Furthermore, ROS-CA-NPs present excellent biocompatibility. The findings suggest that ROS-CA-NPs have the potential to be developed as safe and effective nanotherapeutic agents for a broad range of inflammatory diseases.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety",,ulcerative colitis,3
2023-11-27,37542647,Anti-inflammatory Effects of Siponimod in a Mouse Model of Excitotoxicity-Induced Retinal Injury.,"Glaucoma is a leading cause of permanent blindness worldwide and is characterized by neurodegeneration linked to progressive retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death, axonal damage, and neuroinflammation. Glutamate excitotoxicity mediated through N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors plays a crucial role in glaucomatous RGC loss. Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors (S1PRs) are important mediators of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in the brain and the retina. Siponimod is an immunomodulatory drug for multiple sclerosis and is a selective modulator of S1PR subtypes 1 and 5 and has been shown to have beneficial effects on the central nervous system (CNS) in degenerative conditions. Our previous study showed that mice administered orally with siponimod protected inner retinal structure and function against acute NMDA excitotoxicity. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind these protective effects, we investigated the inflammatory pathways affected by siponimod treatment in NMDA excitotoxicity model. NMDA excitotoxicity resulted in the activation of glial cells coupled with upregulation of the inflammatory NF-kB pathway and increased expression of TNFα, IL1-β, and IL-6. Siponimod treatment significantly reduced glial activation and suppressed the pro-inflammatory pathways. Furthermore, NMDA-induced activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and upregulation of neurotoxic inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were significantly diminished with siponimod treatment. Our data demonstrated that siponimod induces anti-inflammatory effects via suppression of glial activation and inflammatory singling pathways that could protect the retina against acute excitotoxicity conditions. These findings provide insights into the anti-inflammatory effects of siponimod in the CNS and suggest a potential therapeutic strategy for neuroinflammatory conditions.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,"retinopathy, retinal disease",3
2023-11-27,37581762,Impaired Immunomodulatory Properties of the Retina from the Inflammatory Environment of the Damaged Eye.,"The retina represents a highly specialized structure with the primary function to capture a light signal and to convert it into electrical impulses. Any damage or disease of the retina can cause visual impairment. Since retinal degenerative diseases are generally associated with immune cell infiltration, a local inflammatory reaction, and cytokine burn, there is a need for mechanisms to prevent the retina from damage by a deleterious immune reaction. In this study, we show that mouse retinal explants co-cultivated with stimulated spleen cells, inhibit in a dose-dependent manner the activation of T cells, and suppress the production of cytokines interleukin-2, interleukin-10, and interferon-[Formula: see text]. The immunoregulatory properties of the retina were mainly mediated by a paracrine effect since retinal explants, separated by a semipermeable membrane, or supernatants obtained after the cultivation of retinal explants, inhibited the reactivity of immune cells. A model of retinal damage was established by the application of sodium iodate which selectively destroys photoreceptors, as it was demonstrated by a decrease in the number of rhodopsin-positive cells. This process was accompanied by increased infiltration of the retina with cells of the immune system and by a local inflammatory reaction. The pharmacologically damaged retina had significantly decreased the ability to inhibit T cell activation and production of cytokines by immune cells. Overall, the results showed that the retina possesses immunoregulatory properties and inhibits the activation and functions of T cells. However, the immunomodulatory properties of the retina are decreased if the retina is damaged.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinal disease,3

The ROs provide a fascinating tool for basic science research, eye disease modeling, treatment development, and biobanking for tissue/cell replacement. Here we review the previous studies that paved the way for RO technology, the two most widely accepted, standardized protocols to generate ROs, and the utilization of ROs in medical discovery. This review is conducted from the perspective of basic science research, transplantation for regenerative medicine, disease modeling, and therapeutic development for drug screening and gene therapy. ROs have opened avenues for new technologies such as assembloids, coculture with other organoids, vasculature or immune cells, microfluidic devices (organ-on-chip), extracellular vesicles for drug delivery, biomaterial engineering, advanced imaging techniques, and artificial intelligence (AI). Nevertheless, some shortcomings of ROs currently limit their translation for medical applications and pose a challenge for future research.

The major side effects and drawbacks associated with HCQ are cardiotoxicity, retinopathy, gastrointestinal upset, and neuromyopathy however, cardiotoxicity is an increasing concern and it is critical to avoid heart dysfunction induced by HCQ. The present work is focused on receptor and signaling molecules associated with pathways attributing to drug-induced cardiotoxicity. We analyzed the therapeutic efficacy of selected natural products in HCQ-induced cardiotoxicity through insilico. We selected Syzygium cumini polyphenols, quercetin, and p-coumaric acid. The motivation behind selecting quercetin, and p-coumaric acid is their wide applicability as an antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and cardioprotective.For predicting quercetin, p-coumaric acid, and HCQ toxicity and physicochemical properties, in silico studies were performed using ProTox II and Swiss ADME. We further performed molecular docking using Autodock Vina and Discovery Studio visualizer to find the affinity of selected polyphenols against signaling molecules and receptors. Then we performed network pharmacological studies of selected signaling molecules.We analyzed that the computational method indicated quercetin (Δ G -9.3 kcal/mol) has greater binding affinity than p-Coumaric acid for prevention and restoration of the disease while hydroxychloroquine was taken as a control.It can be concluded that Syzygium cumini, polyphenols may aid in the future therapeutic potential against HCQ-induced cardiotoxicity.",no,yes,no,in vitro,"safety, biomarker",,retinopathy,3
2023-11-27,37704122,Shen-Ling-Bai-Zhu-San alleviates the imbalance of intestinal homeostasis in dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis mice by regulating gut microbiota and inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome activation.,"Shen-Ling-Bai-Zhu-San (SLBZS) is a classic formula for strengthening the spleen and dispelling dampness, which has shown excellent efficacy in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in traditional Chinese medicine clinical studies. However, its exact pharmacological mechanism needs to be further elucidated.This study aims to investigate the restorative effect and mechanism of SLBZS on disturbed intestinal homeostasis in DSS-induced colitis mice.A colitis model was induced by 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for seven days, and SLBZS was administered by gavage. The influence of SLBZS on DSS-induced clinical symptoms and disease activity index (DAI) was monitored and analyzed. Alcian blue and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (FITC-WGA) staining were used to assess intestinal mucus changes. The expression of intestinal barrier function indexes and immune-associated indexes were determined by H&E staining, real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and Western blot. And gut microbiota changes were detected by 16S rDNA sequencing technology. The antibiotic experiment was used to explore the role of gut microbiota in SLBZS treatment.The results showed that SLBZS significantly improved the physiological indexes including body weight, DAI score, and colon length of colitis mice. We focused on the effects of SLBZS on intestinal homeostasis in colitis mice. First, SLBZS could enhance the secretion of intestinal mucin and the expression levels of tight junctions and adhesive junctions. Second, SLBZS inhibited the expression level of inflammatory factors and reduced the protein expression level of NLRP3 inflammasome. Third, 16S rDNA sequencing analysis revealed that SLBZS repaired the dysfunctional gut microbiota of colitis mice, such as enhancing the abundance of short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria including Faecalibaculum, Colidextribacter, and Coprococcus. Further, by gut microbiota-depleted mice, we found that SLBZS could not exert an anti-colitis effect when gut microbiota was absent.SLBZS restored intestinal environmental homeostasis by enhancing intestinal barrier function, inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome, and restoring disturbed gut microbiota. And SLBZS could not ameliorate colitis mice with depleted gut microbiota. Our finding provided a theoretical basis for the clinical application of SLBZS in IBD.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3

Additionally, the utility of multimodal imaging in guiding treatment will also be illustrated.Five patients from a single-family pedigree in Ohio with clinical signs of ADNIV were evaluated. Medical history, family history, and complete ocular examinations were obtained during regular clinic visits. Multimodal imaging including ocular coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography, wide-field fundus photographs, and Humphrey visual field testing was obtained for all five patients. Additionally, genetic testing for the Calpain-5 (CAPN5) gene was conducted on all patients.All five patients were noted to have a CAPN5 c.731T > C (p.L244P) mutation on genetic testing. Using multimodal imaging to supplement the clinical examination, pathologic changes such as retinal vascular inflammation, macular edema, and tractional retinal membranes were well illustrated and monitored over time. This allowed for earlier intervention when appropriate such as with intraocular steroid or systemic anti-inflammatory treatments.Phenotypic presentation varied among patients in this series, but is consistent with the spectrum of pathologic changes previously described in patients with other CAPN5 gene mutations. Monitoring of patients with ADNIV utilizing multimodal imaging can help better assess progression of this disease and guide treatment decisions. Additionally, increased genetic testing in patients with inherited retinal diseases may reveal novel gene mutations that could serve as potential targets for future genetic treatment regimens.",no,yes,no,other,"diagnostic, effectiveness",,retinal disease,3
2023-11-27,37806602,C4BP(β-)-mediated immunomodulation attenuates inflammation in DSS-induced murine colitis and in myeloid cells from IBD patients.,"The most recent and promising therapeutic strategies for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have engaged biologics targeting single effector components involved in major steps of the immune-inflammatory processes, such as tumor necrosis factor, interleukins or integrins. Nevertheless, these molecules have not yet met expectations regarding efficacy and safety, resulting in a significant percentage of refractory or relapsing patients. Thus, novel treatment options are urgently needed. The minor isoform of the complement inhibitor C4b-binding protein, C4BP(β-), has been shown to confer a robust anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory phenotype over inflammatory myeloid cells. Here we show that C4BP(β-)-mediated immunomodulation can significantly attenuate the histopathological traits and preserve the intestinal epithelial integrity in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced murine colitis. C4BP(β-) downregulated inflammatory transcripts, notably those related to neutrophil activity, mitigated circulating inflammatory effector cytokines and chemokines such as CXCL13, key in generating ectopic lymphoid structures, and, overall, prevented inflammatory immune cell infiltration in the colon of colitic mice. PRP6-HO7, a recombinant curtailed analogue with only immunomodulatory activity, achieved a similar outcome as C4BP(β-), indicating that the therapeutic effect is not due to the complement inhibitory activity. Furthermore, both C4BP(β-) and PRP6-HO7 significantly reduced, with comparable efficacy, the intrinsic and TLR-induced inflammatory markers in myeloid cells from both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients, regardless of their medication. Thus, the pleiotropic anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activity of PRP6-HO7, able to ""reprogram"" myeloid cells from the complex inflammatory bowel environment and to restore immune homeostasis, might constitute a promising therapeutic option for IBD.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety",,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",3
2023-11-27,37807805,Macrophage-Derived Extracellular Vesicles-Coated Palladium Nanoformulations Modulate Inflammatory and Immune Homeostasis for Targeting Therapy of Ulcerative Colitis.,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease mainly involving the colon and rectum, which features recurrent mucosal inflammation. The excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a trigger for pathological changes such as cell apoptosis and disordered immune microenvironments, which are crucial for the progression of UC and can be a promising therapeutic target. Nowadays, the development of targeted therapeutic strategies for UC is still in its infancy. Thus, developing effective therapies based on ROS scavenging and elucidating their molecular pathways are urgently needed. Herein, a biomimetic nanoformulation (Pd@M) with cubic palladium (Pd) as the core and macrophage-derived extracellular vesicles (MEVs) as the shell is synthesized for the treatment of UC. These Pd@M nanoformulations exhibit multienzyme-like activities for effective ROS scavenging, excellent targeting ability as well as good biocompatibility. It is verified that Pd@M can regulate the polarization state of macrophages by inhibiting glycolysis, and decrease neutrophil infiltration and recruitment. In this way, the colonic inflammatory and immune microenvironment is remodeled, and apoptosis is prevented, ultimately improving colonic mucosal barrier function and alleviating colitis in the mouse model.

2023-11-27,37820857,Sex-oriented perspectives in immunopharmacology.,"Several immunopharmacological agents are effective in the treatment of cancer and immune-mediated conditions, with a favorable impact on life expectancy and clinical outcomes for a large number of patients. Nevertheless, response variation and undesirable effects of these drugs represent major issues, and overall efficacy remains unpredictable. Males and females show a distinct difference in immune system responses, with females generally mounting stronger responses to a variety of stimuli. Therefore, exploring sex differences in the efficacy and safety of immunopharmacological agents would strengthen the practice of precision medicine. As a pharmacological target highlight, programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) is the first functionally characterized ligand of the coinhibitory programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1). The PD-L1/PD-1 crosstalk plays an important role in the immune response and is relevant in cancer, infectious and autoimmune disease. Sex differences in the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors are well documented, with male patients responding better than female patients. Similarly, higher efficacy of and adherence to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors in chronic inflammatory conditions including rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease have been reported in male patients. The pharmacological basis of sex-specific responses to immune system modulating drugs is actively investigated in other settings such as stroke and type 1 diabetes. Advances in therapeutics targeting the endothelium could soon be wielded against autoimmunity and metabolic disorders. Based on the established sexual dimorphism in immune-related pathophysiology and disease presentation, sex-specific immunopharmacological protocols should be integrated into clinical guidelines.",no,yes,no,other,"effectiveness, safety",,crohn's disease,3
2023-11-27,37820919,Bergamot polysaccharides relieve DSS-induced ulcerative colitis via regulating the gut microbiota and metabolites.,"This study aimed to explore the efficacy of polysaccharides from bergamot (BP) in alleviating DSS-induced colitis. Results showed that BP was primarily composed of two components, BP-1 and BP-2, with similar monosaccharide compositions to BP (mainly glucose and xylose) and molecular weights (Mw) of 4.50 × 105 and 2.35 × 105 Da. This study found BP relieved disease symptoms such as weight loss and colon shortening in mice with colitis. Gut microbiota and metabolomics analysis revealed that the BP could also promote the proliferation of beneficial bacteria such as Bifidobacteria, Butyrivibrio, and Blautia, resulting in increased levels of SCFAs and L-phenylalanine, which were associated with phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan metabolism pathways. Further analysis validated the inflammatory activity of L-phenylalanine. Hence, BP may relieve colitis symptoms by regulating the gut microbiota and metabolism, which reduced inflammation and enhanced the expression of tight junctional proteins (TJ proteins) and mucin in the intestine.",no,yes,no,animal,effectiveness,,ulcerative colitis,3

Ustekinumab RP is indicated for the treatment of some forms of plaque psoriasis, active psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. ABP 654 and ustekinumab RP utilize different expression systems, and the purpose of this study was to assess analytical similarity between ABP 654 and ustekinumab RP sourced from the United States (US) and the European Union (EU).The analytical testing plan included general properties, primary structure, higher-order structure, product-related substances and impurities, particles and aggregates, biological activity, and thermal stability and degradation studies.ABP 654 was found to be analytically similar to ustekinumab RP with respect to physicochemical and biological properties, including structure, function, purity, and potency.Based on a comprehensive similarity assessment, ABP 654 was found to be similar to ustekinumab RP, notwithstanding minor physicochemical differences that are not expected to have a clinically meaningful effect on safety or efficacy.",no,yes,no,other,"safety, effectiveness, biomarker",,"crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis",3

However, achieving site specific drug delivery to colon tissues and target cells is a challenging task for formulation scientists. In this study, macrophages-targeted liposome-loaded pectin-chitosan hydrogels were developed for UC treatment via oral administration. Folate-functionalized cholesterol was synthesized as lipid membrane materials for the liposomes containing curcumin (CUR). The incorporation of the liposomal CUR within pectin-chitosan hydrogels resulted in a matrix that exhibited considerable sensitivity to colonic enzymes during in vitro release. The targeted delivery of hybrids was able to effectively reach macrophages. They also showed enhanced capability to downregulate TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β in the lipopolysaccharide-induced Raw 264.7 cells model. DSS-induced mice modelshowed improved anti-UC effects, including accelerated mucosal repair and decreased inflammation and modulate the immune balance in the intestinal tissue of mice with colitis, which may be attributable to increased drug accumulation in the colonic lumen and improved internalization to target cells. Therefore, the incorporation of folate-modified liposomes containing CUR and pectin-chitosan physical hydrogels could potentially serve as a favorable approach for treating UC through an oral colon-targeted drug delivery system.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety",,ulcerative colitis,3

However, it suffers from various drawbacks, including ocular trauma, risk of infection, and poor patient compliance due to frequent administrations. Due to the presence of barriers such as the cornea, it has been a challenge to develop efficient noninvasive ophthalmic eye drops that can reach the retina. Framework nucleic acids (FNAs), known for their excellent biocompatibility and precise, controllable shape and size, have been extensively utilized in drug delivery application. Here, we report the development of size- and shape-resolved fluorescent DNA frameworks for noninvasive retinal administration. Results show that tetrahedral DNA nanostructures (TDNs) with an edge length of 20 bp can reach the retina within 6 h with the highest efficiency.

Regulatory B cells (Bregs) play an important role in maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis. We analyzed the differences of 5-HT and Bregs between peripheral blood of ulcerative colitis (UC) and healthy controls (HC). Besides, 5-HT-treated B cells were adoptively transferred into colitis mice to elucidate the role of 5-HT in regulating Bregs. The level of serum 5-HT and IL-10 in UC patients was lower and both were negatively correlated with disease activity. 5-HT7 receptor (5-HT7R) was higher expressed on Bregs in UC. 5-HT promoted IL-10 production in Bregs through the activation of STAT3. And adoptive transfer of 5-HT-treated B cells alleviated intestinal inflammation via inducing IL-10-producing B cells in mice. Our results suggest that 5-HT/5-HT7R signaling pathway facilitate functional Bregs in constraining inflammation in UC, which may be a new potential prospect in the treatment of UC.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3

The results demonstrated that oral administration of QPro and QPep significantly alleviated colitis symptoms, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloody stools, weight loss, as well as reduced colonic shortening, inflammatory factor release, and intestinal barrier injury. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production rose as QPro and QPep modulated the composition of the intestinal microbiota. Western blotting results revealed that QPro and QPep also suppressed TLR4 levels and inhibited IκB-α and NF-κB phosphorylation in colon tissue, implying that the TLR4/IκB-α/NF-κB signaling pathway may be involved in the amelioration of QPro and QPep in DSS-induced colitis.

2023-11-27,37884204,Synergic effects of EP2 and FP receptors co-activation on Blood-Retinal Barrier and Microglia.,"Macular edema (ME) is caused with disruption of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) followed by fluid accumulation in the subretinal space. Main components of the outer and inner BRB are retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and retinal microvascular endothelial cells, respectively. In addition, glial cells also participate in the functional regulation of the BRB as the member of 'neurovascular unit'. Under various stresses, cells in neurovascular units secrete inflammatory cytokines. Neuroinflammation induced by these cytokines can cause BRB dysfunction by degrading barrier-related proteins and contribute to the pathophysiology of ME. Prostaglandins (PGs) are crucial lipid mediators involved in neuroinflammation. Among PGs, a novel EP2 agonist, omidenepag (OMD) acts on not only the uveoscleral pathway but also the conventional pathway, unlike F prostanoid (FP) receptor agonists. Moreover, the combination use of the EP and the FP agonist is not recommended because of the risk of inflammation. In this study, we investigated effects of OMD and latanoprost acid (LTA), a FP agonist, on BRB and microglia in vitro and in vivo. To investigate the function of outer/inner BRB and microglia, in vitro, ARPE-19 cells, human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs), and MG5 cells were used. Cell viability, inflammatory cytokines mRNA and protein levels, barrier morphology/function, and microglial activation were evaluated using proliferation assays, qRT-PCR, ELISA, immunocytochemistry, trans-epithelial electrical resistance, and permeability assay. Moreover, after vitreous injection into the mouse, outer BRB morphology, glial activation, and cytokine expression were assessed. Each OMD and LTA alone did not affect the viability or cytokines expression of the three types of cells. In ARPE-19 cells, the co-stimulation of OMD and LTA increased the mRNA and protein levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, and VEGF-A) and decreased the barrier function and the junction-related protein (ZO-1 and β-catenin). By contrast in HRMECs, the co-stimulation affected significant differences in the mRNA levels of some cytokine (IL-6 and TNF-α) but enhanced the barrier function. In MG5 cells, the cytokines mRNA and size of Iba1-expressed cell were increased. A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory inhibited the barrier dysfunction and the junction-related protein downregulation in ARPE-19 cells and activation of MG5 cells. Also in vivo, the co-stimulation induced outer BRB disruption, cytokine increase, and retinal glial activation. Therefore, the co-stimulation of EP2 and FP induced the inflammatory cytokine-mediated outer BRB disruption, the enhanced inner BRB function, and the microglial activation. The BRB imbalance and the intrinsic prostaglandin production may be involved in OMD-related inflammation.",no,yes,no,in vitro,"effectiveness, safety",,retinopathy,3
2023-11-27,37897948,"Inhibition of α2,6-sialyltransferase relieves symptoms of ulcerative colitis by regulating Th17 cells polarization.","Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory disease that affects human intestines. Immune imbalance is one of the important factors inducing UC. After the activation of CD4+ T cells, pro-inflammatory cytokines are produced to induce colonic inflammation. α2,6-Sialylation, catalyzed by α2,6-sialyltransferase (ST6GAL1), affects the proliferation, activation, and T cell receptor (TCR) signaling of CD4+ T cells, but its role in CD4+ T cell polarization, regulation of Th17 / Treg balance, and its role in UC are still unclear. We found the number of CD4+ T and Th17 cells increased in colonic tissue with UC. The level of α2,6-sialylation of CD4+ T cells in patients with UC was significantly increased. De-α2,6-sialylation significantly reduced the symptoms of UC in rats. ST6GAL1 gene knockout inhibited the polarization of CD4+ T cells to Th17 cells, and promoted the polarization of CD4+ T cells to Treg cells. ST6GAL1 knockout significantly inhibited the IL-17 signaling pathway in CD4+ T cells and inhibited the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17a. ST6GAL1 and IL-17a are highly expressed in patients with UC, and there is a positive correlation between them. In conclusion, reduced α2,6-sialylation inhibits the polarization of CD4+ T cells to Th17 cells, inhibits IL-17a signaling pathway and reduces the level of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17a to alleviate the symptoms of UC, which is a potential novel target for the clinical treatment of UC.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3
2023-11-27,37898443,The evolving role of cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibition beyond cardiovascular disease.,"The main role of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is the transfer of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides between high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles and triglyceride-rich lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. There is a long history of investigations regarding the inhibition of CETP as a target for reducing major adverse cardiovascular events. Initially, the potential effect on cardiovascular events of CETP inhibitors was hypothesized to be mediated by their ability to increase HDL cholesterol, but, based on evidence from anacetrapib and the newest CETP inhibitor, obicetrapib, it is now understood to be primarily due to reducing LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B. Nevertheless, evidence is also mounting that other roles of HDL, including its promotion of cholesterol efflux, as well as its apolipoprotein composition and anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-diabetic properties, may play important roles in several diseases beyond cardiovascular disease, including, but not limited to, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, and sepsis. Furthermore, although Mendelian randomization analyses suggested that higher HDL cholesterol is associated with increased risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), excess risk of AMD was absent in all CETP inhibitor randomized controlled trial data comprising over 70,000 patients. In fact, certain HDL subclasses may, in contrast, be beneficial for treating the retinal cholesterol accumulation that occurs with AMD. This review describes the latest biological evidence regarding the relationship between HDL and CETP inhibition for Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, sepsis, and AMD.",no,yes,no,other,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,retinopathy,3

The early neuro-glial perturbations, especially retinal Müller cells (rMC) activation, intimately associated with the vascular alterations. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to play critical roles in the progression of DR. Here, we aimed to further explore the role and underlying mechanism of miR-423-5p in Müller cell activation in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice and oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model.Retinal histology, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and biochemical markers were assessed.Our data revealed that the expression of miR-423-5p was significantly increased under high-glucose environment. We also demonstrated that miR-423-5p overexpression markedly accelerated retinal vascular leakage, leukocytosis, and rMC activation. This response was ameliorated in animals pre-treated with the inhibition of miR-423-5p. Specifically, miR-423-5p bound to the nerve growth factor (NGF) 3' UTR region to induce its silencing.

2023-11-27,37951337,Advances in mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles therapy for Sjogren's syndrome-related dry eye disease.,"Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects exocrine glands, particularly lacrimal glands, leading to dry eye disease (DED). DED is a common ocular surface disease that affects millions of people worldwide, causing discomfort, visual impairment, and even blindness in severe cases. However, there is no definitive cure for DED, and existing treatments primarily relieve symptoms. Consequently, there is an urgent need for innovative therapeutic strategies based on the pathophysiology of DED. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as a promising therapeutic tool for various autoimmune disorders, including SS-related DED (SS-DED). A particularly intriguing facet of MSCs is their ability to produce extracellular vesicles (EVs), which contain various bioactive components such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. These molecules play a key role in facilitating communication between cells and modulating a wide range of biological processes. Importantly, MSC-derived EVs (MSC-EVs) have therapeutic properties similar to those of their parent cells, including immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and regenerative properties. In addition, MSC-EVs offer several notable advantages over intact MSCs, including lower immunogenicity, reduced risk of tumorigenicity, and greater convenience in terms of storage and transport. In this review, we elucidate the underlying mechanisms of SS-DED and discuss the relevant mechanisms and targets of MSC-EVs in treating SS-DED. In addition, we comprehensively review the broader landscape of EV application in autoimmune and corneal diseases. This review focuses on the efficacy of MSC-EVs in treating SS-DED, a field of study that holds considerable appeal due to its multifaceted regulation of immune responses and regenerative functions.",no,yes,no,other,effectiveness,,dry eye,3
2023-11-27,37968006,What are the perceptions and concerns of people living with diabetes and National Health Service staff around the potential implementation of AI-assisted screening for diabetic eye disease? Development and validation of a survey for use in a secondary care screening setting.,"The English National Health Service (NHS) Diabetic Eye Screening Programme (DESP) performs around 2.3 million eye screening appointments annually, generating approximately 13 million retinal images that are graded by humans for the presence or severity of diabetic retinopathy. Previous research has shown that automated retinal image analysis systems, including artificial intelligence (AI), can identify images with no disease from those with diabetic retinopathy as safely and effectively as human graders, and could significantly reduce the workload for human graders. Some algorithms can also determine the level of severity of the retinopathy with similar performance to humans. There is a need to examine perceptions and concerns surrounding AI-assisted eye-screening among people living with diabetes and NHS staff, if AI was to be introduced into the DESP, to identify factors that may influence acceptance of this technology.People living with diabetes and staff from the North East London (NEL) NHS DESP were invited to participate in two respective focus groups to codesign two online surveys exploring their perceptions and concerns around the potential introduction of AI-assisted screening.Focus group participants were representative of the local population in terms of ages and ethnicity. Participants' feedback was taken into consideration to update surveys which were circulated for further feedback. Surveys will be piloted at the NEL DESP and followed by semistructured interviews to assess accessibility, usability and to validate the surveys.Validated surveys will be distributed by other NHS DESP sites, and also via patient groups on social media, relevant charities and the British Association of Retinal Screeners. Post-survey evaluative interviews will be undertaken among those who consent to participate in further research.Ethical approval has been obtained by the NHS Research Ethics Committee (IRAS ID: 316631). Survey results will be shared and discussed with focus groups to facilitate preparation of findings for publication and to inform codesign of outreach activities to address concerns and perceptions identified.",no,yes,no,other,"effectiveness, safety",,retinopathy,3
2023-11-27,37971984,Cost-effectiveness analysis of artificial intelligence-based diabetic retinopathy screening in rural China based on the Markov model.,"This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of different diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening strategies in rural regions in China by using a Markov model to make health economic evaluations. In this study, we determined the structure of a Markov model according to the research objectives, which required parameters collected through field investigation and literature retrieval. After perfecting the model with parameters and assumptions, we developed a Markov decision analytic model according to the natural history of DR in TreeAge Pro 2011. For this model, we performed Markov cohort and cost-effectiveness analyses to simulate the probabilistic distributions of different developments in DR and the cumulative cost-effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI)-based screening and ophthalmologist screening for DR in the rural population with diabetes mellitus (DM) in China. Additionally, a model-based health economic evaluation was performed by using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Last, one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the stability of the results. From the perspective of the health system, compared with no screening, AI-based screening cost more (the incremental cost was 37,257.76 RMB (approximately 5,211.31 US dollars)), but the effect was better (the incremental utility was 0.33). Compared with AI-based screening, the cost of ophthalmologist screening was higher (the incremental cost was 14,886.76 RMB (approximately 2,070.19 US dollars)), and the effect was worse (the incremental utility was -0.31). Compared with no screening, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of AI-based DR screening was 112,146.99 RMB (15,595.47 US dollars)/QALY, which was less than the threshold for the ICER (< 3 times the per capita gross domestic product (GDP), 217,341.00 RMB (30,224.03 US dollars)). Therefore, AI-based screening was cost-effective, which meant that the increased cost for each additional quality-adjusted life year was merited. Compared with no screening and ophthalmologist screening for DR, AI-based screening was the most cost-effective, which not only saved costs but also improved the quality of life of diabetes patients. Popularizing AI-based DR screening strategies in rural areas would be economically effective and feasible and can provide a scientific basis for the further formulation of early screening programs for diabetic retinopathy.",no,yes,no,other,effectiveness,,retinopathy,3
2023-11-27,37973897,Vitamin B,"Transient reprogramming by the expression of OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and MYC (OSKM) is a therapeutic strategy for tissue regeneration and rejuvenation, but little is known about its metabolic requirements. Here we show that OSKM reprogramming in mice causes a global depletion of vitamin B12 and molecular hallmarks of methionine starvation. Supplementation with vitamin B12 increases the efficiency of reprogramming both in mice and in cultured cells, the latter indicating a cell-intrinsic effect. We show that the epigenetic mark H3K36me3, which prevents illegitimate initiation of transcription outside promoters (cryptic transcription), is sensitive to vitamin B12 levels, providing evidence for a link between B12 levels, H3K36 methylation, transcriptional fidelity and efficient reprogramming. Vitamin B12 supplementation also accelerates tissue repair in a model of ulcerative colitis. We conclude that vitamin B12, through its key role in one-carbon metabolism and epigenetic dynamics, improves the efficiency of in vivo reprogramming and tissue repair.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3
2023-11-27,37974099,Toxic posterior segment syndrome with retinal vasculitis likely caused by intraocular cotton fiber after vitreoretinal surgery - a case report.,"Intraocular inflammation is common after anterior or posterior segment surgery. They typically manifest either as non-infectious inflammation of the anterior or posterior segment, known as toxic anterior or posterior segment syndrome (TPSS), or as sterile or infective endophthalmitis. In this report, we describe a rare case of TPSS following vitreoretinal surgery, presenting as hemorrhagic retinal vasculitis.A 58-year-old male diagnosed with a left eye acute rhegmatogenous retinal detachment underwent an uneventful primary pars plana vitrectomy with silicone oil endotamponade on the same day of presentation. At presentation, there were no signs of intraocular inflammation, and his visual acuity in the affected eye was 20/200.The retina was well-attached with silicone oil in place on the first post-operative day. Along the inferior retinal periphery, a hemorrhagic occlusive vasculitis was observed. Clinical examination revealed retained intraocular cotton fiber along the inferotemporal quadrant over the retinal surface. In addition to the standard post-operative medications, a course of systemic steroids (40 mg per day of Prednisolone tablets) was started. At the end of the first post-operative week, clinical signs of hemorrhagic retinal vasculitis were beginning to resolve, and by the end of the fourth post-operative week, they had completely resolved.This report describes an unusual diagnosis of TPSS after vitreoretinal surgery, most likely due to the presence of an intraocular cotton fiber. This excessive inflammation of the posterior segment usually responds to a course of topical and systemic steroids.",no,yes,no,other,safety,,retinal disease,3
2023-11-27,37977841,Cardioembolic stroke in the setting of diffuse caseous calcification of the anterolateral papillary muscle.,"A woman in her 70s was admitted for acute, painless vision loss in the left eye. Examination showed cherry red spot in the macula and plaque in the nasal vessels, consistent with central retinal artery occlusion. MRI orbits revealed multifocal subclinical acute infarcts in the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory and bilateral cerebella. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed calcification of the anterolateral papillary muscle. Further characterisation with cardiac MRI elucidated caseous 'toothpaste-like' calcification of the muscle complex. Stroke workup was otherwise unremarkable. The patient underwent hyperbaric treatment with mild improvement. Anticoagulation and surgical intervention were deferred due to known risks and unknown benefit for calcific emboli. The patient was continued on her home dual anti-platelet therapy (DAPT) and discharged with a loop monitor. Caseous calcification of the papillary muscle (CCPM) may be a risk factor for cardioembolic stroke.

2023-11-27,37978212,Anti-inflammatory reprogramming of microglia cells by metabolic modulators to counteract neurodegeneration; a new role for Ranolazine.,"Microglia chronic activation is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases, including the retinal ones, possibly contributing to their etiopathogenesis. However, some microglia sub-populations have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective functions, thus making arduous deciphering the role of these cells in neurodegeneration. Since it has been proposed that functionally different microglia subsets also rely on different metabolic routes, we hypothesized that modulating microglia metabolism might be a tool to enhance their anti-inflammatory features. This would have a preventive and therapeutic potential in counteracting neurodegenerative diseases. For this purpose, we tested various molecules known to act on cell metabolism, and we revealed the anti-inflammatory effect of the FDA-approved piperazine derivative Ranolazine on microglia cells, while confirming the one of the flavonoids Quercetin and Naringenin, both in vitro and in vivo. We also demonstrated the synergistic anti-inflammatory effect of Quercetin and Idebenone, and the ability of Ranolazine, Quercetin and Naringenin to counteract the neurotoxic effect of LPS-activated microglia on 661W neuronal cells. Overall, these data suggest that using the selected molecules -also in combination therapies- might represent a valuable approach to reduce inflammation and neurodegeneration while avoiding long term side effects of corticosteroids.",no,yes,no,in vitro,"effectiveness, safety",,retinal disease,3
2023-11-27,37982762,O-GlcNAcylation Inhibition Upregulates Connexin43 Expression in the Endothelium to Protect the Tight Junction Barrier in Diabetic Retinopathy.,"This study aimed to investigate the effects of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine modification (O-GlcNAcylation) on connexin43 (Cx43) expression and its subsequent effects on tight junction properties in diabetic retinopathy (DR).O-GlcNAcylation levels in primary human retinal vascular endothelial cells (HRVECs) and retinas from rats with diabetes were regulated by treatment with Thiamet G or alloxan. Immunoprecipitation was used to examine the relationship between O-GlcNAcylation and Cx43 expression. Stable overexpression and knockdown of Cx43 in HRVECs were achieved using lentivirus constructs; further, their effects on occludin and zonula occluden-1 (ZO-1) expression and tight junction barrier function were determined.O-GlcNAcylation level increased significantly, whereas Cx43 expression decreased in retinas from rats with diabetes and HRVECs cultured under high-glucose conditions. Immunoprecipitation revealed that Cx43 was modified by O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation simultaneously. O-GlcNAcylation inhibition negatively regulated both total Cx43 and phosphorylated Cx43 expression, subsequently disrupting tight junction properties. Conversely, Cx43 overexpression reversed the disruption of tight junction properties and downregulated vascular endothelial growth factor expression. Consistently, Cx43 overexpression increased transendothelial electrical resistance values in HRVEC layers.O-GlcNAcylation negatively regulated Cx43 expression, contributing to the disruption of the blood retinal barrier. However, O-GlcNAcylation inhibition and Cx43 overexpression could reverse the tight junction disruption. Therefore, O-GlcNAcylation inhibition is a potential target for avoiding tight junction disruption through the Cx43 pathway in DR.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinopathy,3
2023-11-27,37982768,Safety and Efficacy of Adeno-Associated Viral Gene Therapy in Patients With Retinal Degeneration: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"This systematic review evaluates the safety and efficacy of ocular gene therapy using adeno-associated virus (AAV).MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched systematically for controlled or non-controlled interventional gene therapy studies using key words related to retinal diseases, gene therapy, and AAV vectors. The primary outcome measure was safety, based on ocular severe adverse events (SAEs). Secondary outcome measures evaluated efficacy of the therapy based on best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and improvements in visual sensitivity and systemic involvement following ocular delivery. Pooling was done using a DerSimonian Laird random effects model. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, version 1.Our search identified 3548 records. Of these, 80 publications met eligibility criteria, representing 28 registered clinical trials and 5 postmarket surveillance studies involving AAV gene therapy for Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), choroideremia, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), retinitis pigmentosa (RP), X-linked retinoschisis, and achromatopsia. Overall, AAV therapy vectors were associated with a cumulative incidence of at least one SAE of 8% (95% confidence intervals [CIs] of 5% to 12%). SAEs were often associated with the surgical procedure rather than the therapeutic vector itself. Poor or inconsistent reporting of adverse events (AEs) were a limitation for the meta-analysis. The proportion of patients with any improvement in BCVA and visual sensitivity was 41% (95% CIs of 31% to 51%) and 51% (95% CIs of 31% to 70%), respectively. Systemic immune involvement was associated with a cumulative incidence of 31% (95% CI = 21% to 42%).AAV gene therapy vectors appear to be safe but the surgical procedure required to deliver them is associated with some risk. The large variability in efficacy can be attributed to the small number of patients treated, the heterogeneity of the population and the variability in dosage, volume, and follow-up.This systematic review will help to inform and guide future clinical trials.",no,yes,yes,other,"safety, effectiveness",,retinal disease,3

This is achieved by converting one port to a large gauge one-23 or 20-gauge.We did not note the occurrence of high intraocular pressure spikes with this technique as noted by disk pallor or attenuated vessels.A hybrid 23/25-gauge technique for direct PFCL-silicone oil exchange is safe and reduces the risk of intraoperative intraocular pressure spike.",no,yes,no,other,safety,,retinal disease,3
2023-11-27,37989885,Effects of photobiomodulation in the experimental acetic acid-induced colitis: comparison between male and female.,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an important chronic and multifactorial disease, which alters the colon mucosal with a significant impact on life quality affecting both men and women. The difference between genders causes changes in the inflammatory processes, modulating the development of several diseases. The available drugs to treat UC exhibit limited outcomes and side effects; thus, new therapies are needed. Photobiomodulation (PBM) emerges as potential treatment by modulating the inflammatory process without side effects and low costs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of PBM in acetic acid-induced UC comparing the responses between male and females. For this purpose, male and female Wistar rats (36) were submitted to induction of UC by rectal administration of 10% acetic acid (colitis group) and treated or not with PBM (colitis-PBM group) (LED, 660 nm, 100 mW, 150 s) in three points: right side and left of the ventral surface and in the external anal region. Non-manipulated rats were used as control (basal group). We investigated the disease activity index (DAI score), myeloperoxidase enzyme activity (MPO) and release of cytokines in the intestine homogenates, and histological analysis. PBM reduces DAI score, MPO activity, and mast cell degranulation while increased mucous production in both females and males. Moreover, PBM reduced histopathological score as well as the levels of IL-6 and IL-4 in the bowel only in males. We also showed reduced levels of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha after PBM in both males and females, while the levels of IL-10 and IFN-gamma were increased. In conclusion, despite our study has shown some differences between males and females, PBM attenuated the biomarkers of UC in both genders constituting a potential combined treatment that is non-invasive and low cost.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3

2023-11-27,37996250,Therapy for Vitreous Seeding Caused by Retinoblastoma. A Review.,"Retinoblastoma is the most common primary malignant intraocular tumor in children. Seeding, specifically the dispersion of the tumor into the adjacent compartments, represents a  major parameter determining the degree of retinoblastoma according to the International Classification of Retinoblastoma. In this article we focused on vitreous seeding, one of the main limiting factors in the successful ""eye preservation treatment"" of retinoblastoma. This article presents an overview of the history of vitreous seeding of retinoblastoma, established treatment procedures and new-research modalities. The introduction of systemic chemotherapy in the treatment of retinoblastoma at the end of the 1990s represented a  significant breakthrough, which enabled the progressive abandonment of radiotherapy with its attendant side effects. However, the attained concentrations of chemotherapeutics in the vitreous space during systemic chemotherapy are not sufficient for the treatment of vitreous seeding, and the toxic effects of systemic chemotherapy are not negligible. A significant change came with the advent of chemotherapy in situ, with the targeted administration of chemotherapeutic drugs, namely intra-arterial and intravitreal injections, contributing to the definitive eradication of external radiotherapy and a reduction of systemic chemotherapy. Although vitreous seeding remains the most common reason for the failure of intra-arterial chemotherapy, this technique has significantly influenced the original treatment regimen of children with retinoblastoma. However, intravitreal chemotherapy has made the greatest contribution to increasing the probability of preservation of the eyeball and visual functions in patients with advanced findings. Novel local drug delivery modalities, gene therapy, oncolytic viruses and immunotherapy from several ongoing preclinical and clinical trials may represent promising approaches in the treatment of vitreous retinoblastoma seeding, though no clinical trials have yet been completed for routine use.",no,yes,no,other,"effectiveness, safety",,retinoblastoma,3
2023-11-27,37996887,Bilateral central serous retinal detachment in a patient with nephrotic syndrome: a case report.,"The aim of this report is to highlight the importance of considering nephrotic syndrome as a potential underlying cause of bilateral central serous retinal detachment in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus and to underscore the significance of a comprehensive systemic workup in these patients.A 19-year-old Iranian female patient with history of systemic lupus erythematosus presented with progressive vision loss and bilateral macular elevation. Ophthalmic examination revealed periorbital edema, chemosis, and subretinal fluid at the macula of both eyes. Optical coherence tomography confirmed the existence of subretinal fluid and serous detachment located at the macula of both eyes. On fluorescein angiography, there were no signs of subretinal leakage such as smoke stack sign or expansile dot in late phases. Laboratory tests detected hypoalbuminemia and significant proteinuria, leading to the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. Treatment with prednisolone and albumin infusion resulted in improved visual acuity and resolution of subretinal fluid.Nephrotic syndrome can be a rare underlying cause of bilateral central serous retinal detachment, and its association with systemic lupus erythematosus should be considered. Hypoalbuminemia in nephrotic syndrome alters fluid dynamics in the retina, contributing to bilateral central serous retinal detachment.

2023-11-27,37997222,Improvement of Severe Colon Stricture after Rituximab Therapy for Concomitant Mucosa-associated Lymphoid Tissue Lymphoma in a Patient with Ulcerative Colitis.,"Colorectal strictures are uncommon in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). An extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa- associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is rarely involved in the colon but may be associated with inflammatory bowel diseases. A 41-year-old female with a six-year history of UC presented with a severe stricture of the sigmoid colon that prevented the passage of a colonoscope. A histological examination revealed non-specific inflammation and fibrosis without dysplasia or cancer. Despite conventional treatment, including mesalazine and azathioprine for one year after that visit, the stricture persisted. In addition, diffuse, edematous exudative inflammation and multiple shallow ulcers were observed in the distal rectum, revealing a MALT lymphoma testing positive for CD20, CD43, CD5, and Bcl-2, but negative for CD3, CD10, CD23, and cyclin-D1. Four weekly doses of rituximab were administered. Follow-up colonoscopy performed one month after treatment revealed slight improvement in the rectal lesion without remnant histological evidence of a MALT lymphoma. In addition, the stricture showed marked improvement, and the colonoscope could pass easily through the stricture site. This is the first case report on an improvement of a severe sigmoid colon stricture in a patient with UC after rituximab treatment for a concomitant rectal MALT lymphoma.",no,yes,no,other,effectiveness,,ulcerative colitis,3
2023-11-27,37998149,A Novel Combination Therapy Tβ4/VIP Protects against Hyperglycemia-Induced Changes in Human Corneal Epithelial Cells.,"Despite the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy, the majority of adult diabetic patients develop visually debilitating corneal complications, including impaired wound healing. Unfortunately, there is limited treatment for diabetes-induced corneal damage. The current project investigates a novel, peptide-based combination therapy, thymosin beta-4 and vasoactive intestinal peptide (Tβ4/VIP), against high-glucose-induced damage to the corneal epithelium. Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) was used for real-time monitoring of barrier function and wound healing of human corneal epithelial cells maintained in either normal glucose (5 mM) or high glucose (25 mM) ± Tβ4 (0.1%) and VIP (5 nM). Barrier integrity was assessed by resistance, impedance, and capacitance measurements. For the wound healing assay, cell migration was also monitored. Corneal epithelial tight junction proteins (ZO-1, ZO-2, occludin, and claudin-1) were assessed to confirm our findings. Barrier integrity and wound healing were significantly impaired under high-glucose conditions. However, barrier function and cell migration significantly improved with Tβ4/VIP treatment. These findings were supported by high-glucose-induced downregulation of tight junction proteins that were effectively maintained similar to normal levels when treated with Tβ4/VIP. These results strongly support the premise that Tβ4 and VIP work synergistically to protect corneal epithelial cells against hyperglycemia-induced damage. In addition, this work highlights the potential for significant translational impact regarding the treatment of diabetic patients and associated complications of the cornea.",no,yes,no,in vitro,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinopathy,3
2023-11-27,37998361,The Inflammasome-Dependent Dysfunction and Death of Retinal Ganglion Cells after Repetitive Intraocular Pressure Spikes.,"The dysfunction and selective loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) is a known cause of vision loss in glaucoma and other neuropathies, where ocular hypertension (OHT) is the major risk factor. We investigated the impact of transient non-ischemic OHT spikes (spOHT) on RGC function and viability in vivo to identify cellular pathways linking low-grade repetitive mechanical stress to RGC pathology. We found that repetitive spOHT had an unexpectedly high impact on intraocular homeostasis and RGC viability, while exposure to steady OHT (stOHT) of a similar intensity and duration failed to induce pathology. The repetitive spOHT induced the rapid activation of the inflammasome, marked by the upregulation of NLRP1, NLRP3, AIM2, caspases -1, -3/7, -8, and Gasdermin D (GSDMD), and the release of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and other cytokines into the vitreous. Similar effects were also detected after 5 weeks of exposure to chronic OHT in an induced glaucoma model. The onset of these immune responses in both spOHT and glaucoma models preceded a 50% deficit in pattern electroretinogram (PERG) amplitude and a significant loss of RGCs 7 days post-injury. The inactivation of inflammasome complexes in Nlrp1-/-, Casp1-/-, and GsdmD-/- knockout animals significantly suppressed the spOHT-induced inflammatory response and protected RGCs. Our results demonstrate that mechanical stress produced by acute repetitive spOHT or chronic OHT is mechanistically linked to inflammasome activation, which leads to RGC dysfunction and death.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,"retinopathy, retinal disease",3
2023-11-27,37999495,Effects of Sesquiterpene Lactones on Primary Cilia Formation (Ciliogenesis).,"Sesquiterpene lactones (SLs), plant-derived metabolites with broad spectra of biological effects, including anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory, hold promise for drug development. Primary cilia, organelles extending from cell surfaces, are crucial for sensing and transducing extracellular signals essential for cell differentiation and proliferation. Their life cycle is linked to the cell cycle, as cilia assemble in non-dividing cells of G0/G1 phases and disassemble before entering mitosis. Abnormalities in both primary cilia (non-motile cilia) and motile cilia structure or function are associated with developmental disorders (ciliopathies), heart disease, and cancer. However, the impact of SLs on primary cilia remains unknown. This study evaluated the effects of selected SLs (grosheimin, costunolide, and three cyclocostunolides) on primary cilia biogenesis and stability in human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Confocal fluorescence microscopy was employed to analyze the effects on primary cilia formation (ciliogenesis), primary cilia length, and stability. The effects on cell proliferation were evaluated by flow cytometry. All SLs disrupted primary cilia formation in the early stages of ciliogenesis, irrespective of starvation conditions or cytochalasin-D treatment, with no effect on cilia length or cell cycle progression. Interestingly, grosheimin stabilized and promoted primary cilia formation under cilia homeostasis and elongation treatment conditions. Thus, SLs have potential as novel drugs for ciliopathies and tumor treatment.",no,yes,no,in vitro,"effectiveness, safety",,retinal disease,3

It is a widespread complication of diabetes that causes sudden vision loss. Automated retinal vessel segmentation can help to detect these changes more accurately and quickly than manual evaluation by an ophthalmologist. The proposed approach aims to precisely segregate blood vessels in retinal images while shortening the complication and computational value of the segmentation procedure. This can help to improve the accuracy and reliability of retinal image analysis and assist in diagnosing various eye diseases. Attention U-Net is an essential architecture in retinal image segmentation in diabetic retinopathy that obtained promising results in improving the segmentation accuracy especially in the situation where the training data and ground truth are limited. This approach involves U-Net with an attention mechanism to mainly focus on applicable regions of the input image along with the unfolded deep kernel estimation (UDKE) method to enhance the effective performance of semantic segmentation models.

2023-11-27,38001384,Recombinant protein delivery enables modulation of the phototransduction cascade in mouse retina.,"Inherited retinal dystrophies are often associated with mutations in the genes involved in the phototransduction cascade in photoreceptors, a paradigmatic signaling pathway mediated by G protein-coupled receptors. Photoreceptor viability is strictly dependent on the levels of the second messengers cGMP and Ca2+. Here we explored the possibility of modulating the phototransduction cascade in mouse rods using direct or liposome-mediated administration of a recombinant protein crucial for regulating the interplay of the second messengers in photoreceptor outer segments. The effects of administration of the free and liposome-encapsulated human guanylate cyclase-activating protein 1 (GCAP1) were compared in biological systems of increasing complexity (in cyto, ex vivo, and in vivo). The analysis of protein biodistribution and the direct measurement of functional alteration in rod photoresponses show that the exogenous GCAP1 protein is fully incorporated into the mouse retina and photoreceptor outer segments. Furthermore, only in the presence of a point mutation associated with cone-rod dystrophy in humans p.(E111V), protein delivery induces a disease-like electrophysiological phenotype, consistent with constitutive activation of the retinal guanylate cyclase. Our study demonstrates that both direct and liposome-mediated protein delivery are powerful complementary tools for targeting signaling cascades in neuronal cells, which could be particularly important for the treatment of autosomal dominant genetic diseases.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety",,retinal disease,3
2023-11-27,38001450,Shaoyao decoction alleviates TNBS-induced ulcerative colitis by decreasing inflammation and balancing the homeostasis of Th17/Treg cells.,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a persistent and non-specific inflammatory condition that mainly affects the bowels and has challenging treatment. UC has a growing incidence and significantly affects the well-being of patients. Many medications used to treat UC can disrupt the metabolism and immune system homeostasis, frequently leading to significant adverse effects. Hence, exploring alternative therapies, such as traditional Chinese medicine and probiotics, has recently emerged as a primary research hotspot owing to their safety. Although the therapeutic mechanism of Shaoyao decoction has not been clarified, it has demonstrated a beneficial clinical effect on UC.This study aimed to assess the effect of Shaoyao decoction on a rat model of UC and investigate its underlying mechanisms.The rat model of UC was induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS). The extent of damage to the intestines was assessed using the disease activity index (DAI), colonic mucosa damage index (CMDI), and histological scores. Immunohistochemistry was employed to detect the tissue levels of interleukin (IL)-17, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and IL-10. Additionally, the proportion of Th17 and Treg cells was detected using flow cytometry. In colon tissue, the levels of forkhead box (Fox)p3, RAR-related orphan receptor (ROR)γt, IL-6, p-STAT3, and STAT3 proteins were quantified by Western blotting.Treatment with Shaoyao decoction enhanced the overall health of rats and reduced colonic damage. Additionally, Shaoyao decoction significantly alleviated the severity of DAI, CMDI, and HS. The proportion of Th17 cells was reduced, and the proportion of Treg cells was increased by Shaoyao decoction. The expression of IL-17 and RORγt was suppressed by Shaoyao decoction, while the expression of IL-10, TGF-β1, and Foxp3 was increased. The expression of IL-6, p-STAT3, and STAT3 was decreased by Shaoyao decoction.The Shaoyao decoction alleviates the symptoms of TNBS-induced UC by decreasing inflammation and mitigating intestinal damage while preserving the balance between Th17 and Treg.

2023-11-27,38001463,Hypoxic preconditioned MSCs-derived small extracellular vesicles for photoreceptor protection in retinal degeneration.,"Photoreceptor apoptosis is an important pathogenesis of retinal degeneration and a primary cause of vision loss with limited treatment methods. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells-derived small extracellular vesicles (MSC-sEVs) have shown therapeutic value in various ocular disorders. Recent studies have revealed that hypoxic preconditioning can improve the effectiveness of MSC-sEVs in tissue regeneration. However, whether hypoxic preconditioned MSC-sEVs (Hyp-sEVs) exert superior effects on photoreceptor protection relative to normoxic conditioned MSC-sEVs (Nor-sEVs) remains unclear. Here, we reported that Hyp-sEVs further improved retinal structure, recovered retinal function, and suppressed photoreceptor apoptosis in N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced mouse model compared with Nor-sEVs. Hyp-sEVs also exhibited enhanced anti-apoptotic roles in MNU-provoked 661 W cell injury in vitro. We then analyzed the protein profiles of Nor-sEVs and Hyp-sEVs by LC-MS/MS and found that growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43) was enriched in Hyp-sEVs. The knockdown of GAP43 abolished the retinal therapeutic effects of Hyp-sEVs. Mechanistically, hypoxic stimulation-induced hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) activation was responsible for preventing tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25)-mediated GAP43 ubiquitination and degradation, leading to the upregulation of GAP43 in Hyp-sEVs. Together, our findings uncover the efficacy and mechanism of Hyp-sEVs-based photoreceptor protection and highlight the potential of Hyp-sEVs as optimized therapeutics for retinal degeneration.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinal disease,3
2023-11-27,38002251,APE1/Ref-1 as a Therapeutic Target for Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by chronic relapsing inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. The prevalence of IBD is increasing with approximately 4.9 million cases reported worldwide. Current therapies are limited due to the severity of side effects and long-term toxicity, therefore, the development of novel IBD treatments is necessitated. Recent findings support apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1/reduction-oxidation factor 1 (APE1/Ref-1) as a target in many pathological conditions, including inflammatory diseases, where APE1/Ref-1 regulation of crucial transcription factors impacts significant pathways. Thus, a potential target for a novel IBD therapy is the redox activity of the multifunctional protein APE1/Ref-1. This review elaborates on the status of conventional IBD treatments, the role of an APE1/Ref-1 in intestinal inflammation, and the potential of a small molecule inhibitor of APE1/Ref-1 redox activity to modulate inflammation, oxidative stress response, and enteric neuronal damage in IBD.",no,yes,no,other,"effectiveness, safety",,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",3

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. Patients with IBD are at increased risk of colon cancer compared to the general population. Kinase signaling pathways play critical roles in both the inflammation and regulating cellular processes such as proliferation and survival that contribute to cancer development. Here we review the interplay of kinase signaling pathways (mitogen-activated protein kinases, cyclin-dependent kinases, autophagy-activated kinases, JAK-STAT, and other kinases) and their effects on colitis-associated colon cancer. We also discuss the role of JAK-STAT signaling in the pathogenesis of IBD and the therapeutic landscape of JAK inhibitors for the treatment of IBD.",no,yes,no,other,"effectiveness, safety",,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",3
2023-11-27,38003037,Global Frequency Analyses of Canine Progressive Rod-Cone Degeneration-Progressive Retinal Atrophy and Collie Eye Anomaly Using Commercial Genetic Testing Data.,"Hundreds of genetic variants associated with canine traits and disorders have been identified, with commercial tests offered. However, the geographic distributions and changes in allele and genotype frequencies over prolonged, continuous periods of time are lacking. This study utilized a large set of genotypes from dogs tested for the progressive rod-cone degeneration-progressive retinal atrophy (prcd-PRA) G>A missense PRCD variant (n = 86,667) and the collie eye anomaly (CEA)-associated NHEJ1 deletion (n = 33,834) provided by the commercial genetic testing company (Optigen/Wisdom Panel, Mars Petcare Science & Diagnostics). These data were analyzed using the chi-square goodness-of-fit test, time-trend graphical analysis, and regression modeling in order to evaluate how test results changed over time. The results span fifteen years, representing 82 countries and 67 breeds/breed mixes. Both diseases exhibited significant differences in genotype frequencies (p = 2.7 × 10-152 for prcd-PRA and 0.023 for CEA) with opposing graphical trends. Regression modeling showed time progression to significantly affect the odds of a dog being homozygous or heterozygous for either disease, as do variables including breed and breed popularity. This study shows that genetic testing informed breeding decisions to produce fewer affected dogs. However, the presence of dogs homozygous for the disease variant, especially for prcd-PRA, was still observed fourteen years after test availability, potentially due to crosses of unknown carriers. This suggests that genetic testing of dog populations should continue.",no,yes,no,other,effectiveness,,retinal disease,3
2023-11-27,38003345,Inactivation of Group 1B Phospholipase A,"Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) enzymes influence inflammatory bowel disease in both positive and negative manners depending on the type of PLA2 that is expressed. This study explored the influence of the abundantly expressed Group 1B PLA2 (PLA2G1B) on ulcerative colitis. Wild-type C57BL/6J mice and Pla2g1b-/- mice were treated with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 5 days to induce epithelial injury, followed by another 5 days without DSS for recovery. The Pla2g1b-/- mice displayed significantly less body weight loss, colitis pathology, and disease activity indexes compared to the wild-type mice. The differences in colitis were not due to differences in the colonic lysophospholipid levels, but higher numbers of stem and progenitor cells were found in the intestines of Pla2g1b-/- mice compared to the wild-type mice. The DSS-treated Pla2g1b-/- mice also showed higher expressions of genes that are responsible for epithelial repair and lower expressions of proinflammatory cytokine genes in the colon, as well as reduced inflammatory cytokine levels in the plasma. In vitro experiments revealed the PLA2G1B stimulation of inflammatory cytokine expression by myeloid cells. PLA2G1B inactivation protects against DSS-induced colitis in mice by increasing the intestinal stem cell reservoir for epithelial repair and reducing myeloid cell inflammation in the diseased colon. Thus, PLA2G1B may be a target for colitis management.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3

Although IOP is controlled pharmacologically, no treatment is available to restore retinal and optic nerve function. In this paper, we aimed to develop a novel gene therapy for glaucoma using an AAV2-based thioredoxin 2 (Trx2)-exoenzyme C3 transferase (C3) fusion protein expression vector (scAAV2-Trx2-C3). We evaluated the therapeutic effects of this vector in vitro and in vivo using dexamethasone (DEX)-induced glaucoma models. We found that scAAV2-Trx2-C3-treated HeLa cells had significantly reduced GTP-bound active RhoA and increased phosphor-cofilin Ser3 protein expression levels. scAAV2-Trx2-C3 was also shown to inhibit oxidative stress, fibronectin expression, and alpha-SMA expression in DEX-treated HeLa cells. NeuN immunostaining and TUNEL assay in mouse retinal tissues was performed to evaluate its neuroprotective effect upon RGCs, whereas changes in mouse IOP were monitored via rebound tonometer. The present study showed that scAAV2-Trx2-C3 can protect RGCs from degeneration and reduce IOP in a DEX-induced mouse model of glaucoma, while immunohistochemistry revealed that the expression of fibronectin and alpha-SMA was decreased after the transduction of scAAV2-Trx2-C3 in murine eye tissues. Our results suggest that AAV2-Trx2-C3 modulates the outflow resistance of the trabecular meshwork, protects retinal and other ocular tissues from oxidative damage, and may lead to the development of a gene therapeutic for glaucoma.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety",,retinopathy,3

However, assessing local retinal function can be challenging; therefore, photopic and scotopic ERGs are used to record whole-retinal function. This study evaluated focal retinal function in rats exposed to continuous light using a multifocal ERG (mfERG) system. The rats were exposed to 1000 lux of fluorescent light for 24 h to induce photoreceptor degeneration. After light exposure, the rats were reared under cyclic light conditions (12 h: 5 lux, 12 h: dark). Photopic and multifocal ERGs and single-flash and multifocal visual evoked potentials (mfVEPs) were recorded 7 days after light exposure. Fourteen days following light exposure, paraffin-embedded sections were prepared from the eyes for histological evaluation. The ERG and VEP responses dramatically decreased after 24 h of light exposure, and retinal area-dependent decreases were observed in mfERGs and mfVEPs. Histological assessment revealed severe damage to the superior retina and less damage to the inferior retina. Considering the recorded visual angles of mfERGs and mfVEPs, the degenerated area shown on the histological examinations correlates well with the responses from multifocal recordings.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinal disease,3
2023-11-27,38003700,A Comprehensive Assessment of Tear-Film-Oriented Diagnosis (TFOD) in a Dacryoadenectomy Dry Eye Model.,"Tear film instability is a major cause of dry eye disease. In order to treat patients with short tear film breakup time (TBUT)-type dry eye, the development of tear film stabilizing agents is essential. However, the lack of an appropriate animal model of tear film instability has made drug development difficult. Although rabbit dry eye models have been reported in the past, there are only a few reports that focus on tear film instability. Herein, we assessed the tear film stability of a rabbit dry eye model induced by dacryoadenectomy. A clinical evaluation of the ocular surface, interferometry, and histological assessments of the cornea and conjunctiva were performed. Following the removal of the lacrimal glands, TBUT was shortened significantly, with dimple and random breakup patterns prominently observed. Furthermore, the blink rate in this model increased after dacryoadenectomy, suggesting that this model partially captured the phenotypes of human short TBUT-type dry eye and may be useful as an animal model for investigating potential drug candidates.",no,yes,no,animal,effectiveness,,dry eye,3
2023-11-27,38004039,Prophylactic Coloprotective Effect of ,"Background and Objectives: Urtica dioica, a source of bioactive functional compounds, provides nutritional and gastrointestinal therapeutic benefits. This study attempted to investigate the prophylactic coloprotective action of an aqueous extract of Urtica dioica (AEUD) on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis (UC). Materials and Methods: Phenolic compounds, total sugar, and mineral levels were determined in AEUD. Then, AEUD at different doses (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg, BW, p.o.) and mesalazine (MESA) as a standard treatment (100 mg/kg, BW, p.o.) were given orally for 21 days. Acute colitis was induced by administering drinking water with 5% (w/v) DSS for 7 days. Body weight variation, fecal occult blood, and stool consistency were determined daily. The severity of colitis was graded according to colon length, disease activity index (DAI), histological evaluations, and biochemical alterations. Rats orally administered DSS regularly developed clinical and macroscopic signs of colitis. Results: Due to its richness in phenolic and flavonoid compounds (247.65 ± 2.69 mg EAG/g MS and 34.08 ± 0.53 mg EQt/g MS, respectively), AEUD markedly ameliorated DAI, ulcer scores, colon length shortening, colonic histopathological changes, and hematological and biochemical modifications. Taken together, AEUD treatment notably (p < 0.01) suppressed DSS-induced UC by reducing oxidative stress via lowering MDA/H2O2 production and stimulating the effect of enzyme antioxidants as well as attenuating inflammation by decreasing CRP levels by 79.5% between the DSS and DSS + AEUD-50 groups compared to the MESA group (75.6%). Conclusions: AEUD was sufficient to exert a coloprotective effect that might be influenced by its bioactive compounds' anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capabilities.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3
2023-11-27,38004208,"Sea Cucumber Peptides Ameliorate DSS-Induced Ulcerative Colitis: The Role of the Gut Microbiota, the Intestinal Barrier, and Macrophage Polarization.","The incidence of ulcerative colitis (UC) is increasing annually. There are few treatments for UC patients, and some drugs have serious side effects. Sea cucumber peptide (SCP) has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and other biological activities, and various sea cucumber species are in pharmaceutical development. However, relevant studies on the effects of SCP on UC progression are still lacking. In this study, a mouse model of acute colitis was induced by 3% dextran sulfate (DSS), and the effect of 500 mg/kg SCP on colitis was investigated. The results showed that SCP can alleviate DSS-induced colon damage and intestinal barrier damage. SCP significantly inhibited the expression of inflammatory factors and oxidative stress in UC mice. SCP reversed the intestinal microbiota dysregulation induced by DSS, inhibited the growth of Sutterella, Prevotella_9 and Escherichia-Shigella harmful bacteria, and increased the abundance of Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group. At the same time, SCP treatment significantly inhibited the LPS-induced polarization of M1 macrophages, which may be mediated by two monopeptides, IPGAPGVP and TGPIGPPGSP, via FPR2. In conclusion, SCP can protect against colitis by modulating the intestinal microbiota composition and the intestinal barrier and inhibiting the polarization of M1 macrophages.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3
2023-11-27,38004229,Compromised NHE8 Expression Is Responsible for Vitamin D-Deficiency Induced Intestinal Barrier Dysfunction.,"Objectives: Vitamin D (VitD) and Vitamin D receptor (VDR) are suggested to play protective roles in the intestinal barrier in ulcerative colitis (UC). However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Evidence demonstrates that Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 8 (NHE8, SLC9A8) is essential in maintaining intestinal homeostasis, regarded as a promising target for UC therapy. Thus, this study aims to investigate the effects of VitD/VDR on NHE8 in intestinal protection. Methods: VitD-deficient mice, VDR-/- mice and NHE8-/- mice were employed in this study. Colitis mice were established by supplementing DSS-containing water. Caco-2 cells and 3D-enteroids were used for in vitro studies. VDR siRNA (siVDR), VDR over-expression plasmid (pVDR), TNF-α and NF-κb p65 inhibitor QNZ were used for mechanical studies. The expression of interested proteins was detected by multiple techniques. Results: In colitis mice, paricalcitol upregulated NHE8 expression was accompanied by restoring colonic mucosal injury. In VitD-deficient and VDR-/- colitis mice, NHE8 expression was compromised with more serious mucosal damage. Noteworthily, paricalcitol could not prevent intestinal barrier dysfunction and histological destruction in NHE8-/- mice. In Caco-2 cells and enteroids, siVDR downregulated NHE8 expression, further promoted TNF-α-induced NHE8 downregulation and stimulated TNF-α-induced NF-κb p65 phosphorylation. Conversely, QNZ blocked TNF-α-induced NHE8 downregulation in the absence or presence of siVDR. Conclusions: Our study indicates depressed NHE8 expression is responsible for VitD-deficient-induced colitis aggravation. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of VitD/VDR in intestine protection in UC.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3

There is an urgent need to explore the underlying mechanisms of vitamin D (VD) as an effective treatment.Dextran sulfate sodium-induced mice and lipopolysaccharide-induced HCT116 cells were used to establish the classic UC models in vivo and in vitro, respectively. Typical symbols of inflammation (IL-6, COX-2), oxidative stress (MDA, MPO, GSH), and ferroptosis (ACSL4, GPX4, SLC7A11, and Iron) were analyzed by Western blot, Immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and relative assay kits. The inflammation factors and oxidative stress injury of cells transfected with ACSL4+/+ plasmids were tested by Western blot, MDA, and MPO methods.Vitamin D attenuated the levels of COX-2, IL-6, Iron, MDA, and MPO and improved SOD1 and GSH contents in DSS + VD and LPS + VD groups, compared with model groups. Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) could relieve the levels of COX-2, IL-6, Iron, MDA, and MPO while increasing the contents of SOD1 and GSH in DSS + Fer-1 and LPS + Fer-1 compared to model groups. VD downregulated the expression of ACSL4 and upregulated GPX4 in tissues and cells. After transfected with ACSL4+/+ plasmids, we found VD's role of downregulating inflammation and oxidative stress was relieved.Vitamin D can relieve UC by inhibiting ferroptosis both in mice and in cells through the negative regulation of ACSL4, providing new insight into the therapeutic function of VD on UC.",no,yes,no,other,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3
2023-11-27,38005385,Anti-Ulcerative Colitis Effects and Active Ingredients in Ethyl Acetate Extract from Decoction of ,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an intractable disease prevalent worldwide. While ethyl acetate extract from decoction of Sargentodoxa cuneata (EAdSc) has potential anti-inflammatory activity, its effects on UC remain unknown. In this study, the constituent compounds discussed in the literature and identified by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were collected, and the blood-soluble components of EAdSc were identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The network pharmacology analysis and molecular docking analysis were performed to explore the potential underlying mechanism and active ingredients of EAdSc against UC. Furthermore, mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC were used to study the therapeutic effects and validate the mechanism of EAdSc against UC. A total of 53 compounds from EAdSc were identified in the literature and by GC-MS, and 22 blood-soluble EAdSc components were recognized. Network pharmacology analysis revealed that multiple inflammatory signaling pathways are involved in EAdSc's anti-UC activity. Furthermore, molecular docking analysis showed that the eleutheroside A, liriodendrin, epicatechin, 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol, catechin, androsin, coumaroyltyramine, and catechol may be active against UC through the TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway. EAdSc reduced the disease activity, macroscopic colon damage, and histological damage indices, as well as inhibiting DSS-induced spleen enlargement and colon shortening. In addition, EAdSc decreased the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-17, as well as the expression of TLR4, NF-κB p65, NLRP3, and Caspase-1 mRNA in colon tissues.

Most CSCR cases resolve spontaneously, and normal vision returns, while some chronic cases can result in blindness. This report is of a 30-year-old man with a recent history of Corona virus disease (COVID)-19 requiring corticosteroid treatment who developed bilateral CSCR with unilateral fibrin and a 7-month follow-up. CASE REPORT A 30-year-old male patient presented with malaise and high fever. The patient tested positive for COVID-19, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus and was admitted. During hospitalization, he received intravenous (IV) corticosteroids for 1 week (6 mg dexamethasone IV once daily). Following hospitalization, the patient received per os methylprednisolone 16 mg (16 mg once daily for 3 days, 8 mg once daily for 3 days, 4 mg once daily for 3 days, and 2 mg once daily for 3 days). One month later, the patient presented with bilateral visual acuity (VA) deterioration and acute CSCR. The diagnosis and follow-up were performed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA). The patient was followed-up for a period of 7 months, during which, although the VA improved and remained stable, the OCT findings were changing.

This study intended to explore the role of CDC42 in the progression of diabetic retinopathy, and the underlying mechanism. Human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (hRMECs) were cultured in 5.5 mM glucose (normal glucose) or 25 mM glucose (high glucose; HG) medium, respectively. CDC42 overexpression plasmid and small interference RNA (oe-CDC42 and si-CDC42) or corresponding negative controls (oe-NC and si-NC) were transfected into hRMECs under HG. Then, platelet-activating factor C-16 (C16-PAF) (MEK/ERK pathway activator) was added to si-CDC42 or si-NC transfected hRMECs under HG. Our study showed that HG increased CDC42 mRNA and protein, cell viability, invasive cell count, branch points, and tube length but reduced cell apoptosis in hRMECs. CDC42 upregulation enhanced cell viability, invasive cell count, branch points, tube length, p-MEK, and p-ERK, but attenuated cell apoptosis. Downregulation of CDC42 exhibited opposite trends. In addition, C16-PAF also increased cell viability, invasive cell count, branch points, and tube length, p-MEK, and p-ERK, but retarded cell apoptosis. Notably, C16-PAF diminished the effect of CDC42 downregulation on the above-mentioned functions in hRMECs under HG. Conclusively, CDC42 promotes HG-induced hRMEC viability and invasion, as well as angiogenesis, but inhibits apoptosis by activating the MEK/ERK pathway, which may be responsible for the progression of diabetic retinopathy.",no,yes,no,in vitro,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinopathy,3

This study aims to investigate how Veillonella ratti (V. ratti) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) interact with each other and alleviate dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) in a mouse model. We assess their metabolic interactions regarding carbon sources through co-culturing in a modified medium. In the in vitro experiments, V. ratti and LA were inoculated in mono-cultures and co-culture, and viable cell counts, OD600, pH, lactic acid, glucose and SCFAs were measured. For the in vivo experiment, 60 C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into five groups and administered V. ratti and LA alone or in combination via oral gavage (1 × 109 CFU mL-1 per day per mouse) for 14 days. On the seventh day, 2.5% DSS was added to the drinking water to induce colitis. The effects of these probiotics on UC were evaluated by assessing intestinal barrier integrity and intestinal inflammation in the gut microenvironment. In vitro results demonstrated that co-culturing V. ratti with LA significantly increased viable cell numbers, lactic acid production, and SCFA production, while reducing pH and glucose levels in the medium. In vivo findings revealed that intervention with V. ratti, particularly in combination with LA, alleviated symptoms, including weight loss, colon shortening, and tissue damage. These probiotics mitigated intestinal inflammation by down-regulating pro-inflammatory molecules, such as IL-6, IL-1β, IL-γ, iNOS, and IFN-γ, as well as oxidative stress markers, including MDA and MPO. Concurrently, they upregulated the activity of anti-inflammatory enzymes, namely, SOD and GSH, and promoted the production of SCFAs. The combined intervention of V. ratti and LA significantly increased acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid, valeric acid, and total SCFAs in cecal contents. Furthermore, the intervention of V. ratti and LA increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria, such as Akkermansia, while reducing the abundance of harmful bacteria, such as Escherichia-Shigella and Desulfovibrio, thereby mitigating excessive inflammation. These findings highlight the enhanced therapeutic effects resulting from the interactions between V. ratti and LA, demonstrating the potential of this combined probiotic approach.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3

However, the specific molecular mechanisms that trigger PPAR-γ's anti-inflammatory ability in microglia are yet to be expounded. Thus, in this study, we aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms behind the anti-inflammatory effects of PPAR-γ in hypoxia-stimulated rat retinal microglial cells.We used shRNA expressing lentivirus to knock down PPAR-γ and CD200 genes, and we assessed hypoxia-induced polarization markers release - M1 (iNOS, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) and M2 (Arg-1, YM1, IL-4, and IL-10) by RT-PCR. We also monitored PPAR-γ-related signals (PPAR-γ, PPAR-γ in cytoplasm or nucleus, CD200, and CD200Rs) by Western blot and RT-PCR. Our results showed that hypoxia enhanced PPAR-γ and CD200 expressions in microglial cells. Moreover, PPAR-γ agonist 15d-PGJ2 elevated CD200 and CD200R1 expressions, whereas sh-PPAR-γ had the opposite effect. Following hypoxia, expressions of M1 markers increased significantly, while those of M2 markers decreased, and the above effects were attenuated by 15d-PGJ2. Conversely, knocking down PPAR-γ or CD200 inhibited the polarization of microglial cells to M2 phenotype.Our findings demonstrated that PPAR-γ performed an anti-inflammatory function in hypoxia-stimulated microglial cells by promoting their polarization to M2 phenotype via the CD200-CD200R1 pathway.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,"retinopathy, retinal disease",3

Although excitotoxicity is considered the primary mechanism of cell death during an ischemic event, antagonists of glutamatergic receptors have been unsuccessful in clinical trials with patients suffering ischemia or stroke. Our main purpose was to analyze if the transient receptor potential channel 7 (TRPM7) could contribute to retinal dysfunction in retinal pathologies associated with ischemia. By using an experimental model of acute retinal ischemia, we analyzed the changes in retinal function by electroretinography and the changes in retinal morphology by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT-angiography (OCTA). Immunohistochemistry was performed to assess the pattern of TRPM7 and its expression level in the retina. Our results show that ischemia elicited a decrease in retinal responsiveness to light stimuli along with reactive gliosis and a significant increase in the expression of TRPM7 in Müller cells.

Six weeks before ONC, mice received rAAV-shRNA (Park7)-EGFP or rAAV-EGFP intravitreally. Western blotting was used to detect Park7 levels. RGC survival was measured using immunofluorescence. Retinal cell apoptosis was detected using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase nick-end-labelling. An electroretinogram (ERG) and the optomotor response (OMR) were used to assess RGC function. Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) levels were assessed using western blotting.ONC injury increased the relative expression of Park7 significantly and decreased RGC survival, the amplitude of the photopic negative response (PhNR), and OMR. Intravitreal injection of rAAV-shRNA(Park7)-EGFP downregulated Park7 expression and was clearly demonstrated by the green fluorescence protein in many retinal layers. Moreover, Park7 downregulation aggravated the decrease in RGC survival and amplitude of PhNR as well as the visual acuity after ONC. However, inhibition of Park7 significantly increased Keap1 levels, decreased the total and nuclear Nrf2 levels, and reduced HO-1 levels.Park7 downregulation enhanced RGC injury and decreased retinal electrophysiological response and OMR after ONC in mice via the Keap1-Nrf2-HO-1 signaling pathway.

We aimed to determine whether ZMG, alone or in combination with Emu Oil, could reduce acute colitis severity in rats. Male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 8/group) were orally-administered either vehicle, ZMG, Emu Oil (EO) or ZMG combined with EO (ZMG/EO) daily. Rats were provided ad libitum access to drinking water (Groups 1-4) or dextran sulphate sodium (DSS; 2%w/v; Groups 5-8) throughout the trial (days 0-5) before euthanasia on day 6. Disease activity index, crypt depth, degranulated mast cells (DMCs) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were assessed. p < 0.05 was considered significant. DSS increased disease severity (days 3-6) compared to normal controls (p < 0.05). Importantly, in DSS-administered rats, ZMG/EO (day 3) and ZMG (day 6) reduced disease activity index compared to controls (p < 0.05). Following DSS consumption, distal colonic crypts lengthened (p < 0.01), occurring to a greater extent with EO compared to ZMG and ZMG/EO (p < 0.001). DSS increased colonic DMC numbers compared to normal controls (p < 0.001); an effect decreased only by EO (p < 0.05). Colonic MPO activity increased following DSS consumption (p < 0.05); notably, ZMG, EO and ZMG/EO treatments decreased MPO activity compared to DSS controls (p < 0.001). EO, ZMG and ZMG/EO did not impact any parameter in normal animals. Emu Oil and ZMG independently decreased selected indicators of colitic disease severity in rats; however, the combination did not reveal any additional benefit.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3
2023-11-29,37554103,Association between diabetic retinopathy and diabetic foot ulcer in patients with diabetes: A meta-analysis.,"This study aimed to explore the relationship between diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) to provide evidence for the prevention of diabetic complications. PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database and Wanfang Data databases were searched from their inception until March 2023 for studies on the relationship between DR and DFU. Two researchers independently screened the literature and extracted data according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The meta-analysis was performed using the RevMan 5.3 software. Eleven articles referring to 10 208 patients were included, of whom 2191 patients had DFU and 8017 patients did not have DFU. The meta-analysis results showed that DR significantly increased the incidence of DFU (47.94% vs. 16.38%; OR, 4.13; 95% CI, 2.33-7.33; p < 0.001). The results of this study suggest that patients with DR have a higher risk of developing DFU, highlighting the importance of regular screening for these two complications to prevent serious adverse outcomes of diabetes.

In addition to a reduction in quality of life, DED causes vision loss and when severe, blindness. Mitochondrial dysfunction occurs as a consequence of hyperosmolar stress. We have previously reported on a role for the insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) in the regulation of mitochondrial ultrastructure and metabolism in mucosal surface epithelial cells; however, this appears to be context-specific. Due to the finding that IGFBP-3 expression is decreased in response to hyperosmolar stress in vitro and in an animal model of DED, we next sought to determine whether the hyperosmolar stress-mediated decrease in IGFBP-3 alters mitophagy, a key mitochondrial quality control mechanism. Here we show that hyperosmolar stress induces mitophagy through differential regulation of BNIP3L/NIX and PINK1-mediated pathways. In corneal epithelial cells, this was independent of p62. The addition of exogenous IGFBP-3 abrogated the increase in mitophagy. This occurred through regulation of mTOR, highlighting the existence of a new IGFBP-3-mTOR signaling pathway. Together, these findings support a novel role for IGFBP-3 in mediating mitochondrial quality control in DED and have broad implications for epithelial tissues subject to hyperosmolar stress and other mitochondrial diseases.",no,yes,no,in vitro,"effectiveness, biomarker",,dry eye,3
2023-11-29,37695084,Improved Reverse Postauricular Island Flap for Repair of Lower Conjunctival Fornix Retraction.,"Repair of lower conjunctival fornix retraction is a great challenge for plastic surgeons in the aspects of orbital prosthesis retaining and cosmetic appearance. Hereby, a 25-year-old woman, suffering from lower conjunctival fornix retraction after the removal of retinoblastoma and radiotherapy, was undertaking the treatment with an improved reverse postauricular island flap for expansion of the lower conjunctival fornix, and volume augmentation of the anophthalmic socket in one stage. The flap was based on the parietal branch of the superficial temporal artery and its vascular architecture to the postauricular vascular system, and successfully transferred by passing through a subcutaneous tunnel. The satisfactory result indicated that the mentioned technique may be a good option in surgical rehabilitation of the stable depth of the lower conjunctival fornix, not only from the reliable blood supply and the suitable thickness of the flap but also from the less donor morbidity without an exposed unsightly scar.Level V.",no,yes,no,other,effectiveness,,retinopathy,3
2023-11-29,37742895,"An antioxidative, green and safe nanofibers-based film containing pullulan, sodium hyaluronate and Ganoderma lucidum fermentation for enhanced skincare.","Dry masks made of natural active ingredients that are packaged in sustainable paper and free of irritating additives (e.g. preservatives, stabilizers) are a trend in the concept of healthy skincare, which possess the advantages of portability, safety and environmental friendliness. The bioactive ingredients obtained from natural plant fermentation are gradually becoming an important alternative additive for facial skincare. Herein, a novel dry facial healthcare mask was fabricated by electrospinning incorporating natural ingredients including pullulan (Pu), sodium hyaluronate (SH), and Ganoderma lucidum fermentation (GLF). The morphology, dissolving capacity, bioactivity, and safety of the obtained masks were investigated in vitro, and their antioxidation and moisturizing activities were verified at the cellular level. The results indicated that the fibrillary films based on pullulan could be dissolved in water within 20 s with good water retention capacity and film with high concentration of GLF (Pu/SH/GLF-3) could scavenge 79 % of DPPH. The films had good ability to resist microbial contamination and non-eye irritation via observing colony growth for 12 months after ultraviolet sterilization and the ocular irritation test of chicken chorioallantoic membrane. Meanwhile, cell experiments further confirmed that they did not exhibit cytotoxicity and could increase the expression of proteins related to moisturizing and antioxidation. The fascinating films have promising application prospects in cosmetic masks.

2023-11-29,37934489,Platinum Nanozymes Counteract Photoreceptor Degeneration and Retina Inflammation in a Light-Damage Model of Age-Related Macular Degeneration.,"Degeneration of photoreceptors in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is associated with oxidative stress due to the intense aerobic metabolism of rods and cones that if not properly counterbalanced by endogenous antioxidant mechanisms can precipitate photoreceptor degeneration. In spite of being a priority eye disease for its high incidence in the elderly, no effective treatments for AMD exist. While systemic administration of antioxidants has been unsuccessful in slowing down degeneration, locally administered rare-earth nanoparticles were shown to be effective in preventing retinal photo-oxidative damage. However, because of inherent problems of dispersion in biological media, limited antioxidant power, and short lifetimes, these NPs are still confined to the preclinical stage. Here we propose platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs), potent antioxidant nanozymes, as a therapeutic tool for AMD. PtNPs exhibit high catalytic activity at minimal concentrations and protect primary neurons against oxidative insults and the ensuing apoptosis. We tested the efficacy of intravitreally injected PtNPs in preventing or mitigating light damage produced in dark-reared albino Sprague-Dawley rats by in vivo electroretinography (ERG) and ex vivo retina morphology and electrophysiology. We found that both preventive and postlesional treatments with PtNPs increased the amplitude of ERG responses to light stimuli. Ex vivo recordings demonstrated the selective preservation of ON retinal ganglion cell responses to light stimulation in lesioned retinas treated with PtNPs. PtNPs administered after light damage significantly preserved the number of photoreceptors and inhibited the inflammatory response to degeneration, while the preventive treatment had a milder effect. The data indicate that PtNPs can effectively break the vicious cycle linking oxidative stress, degeneration, and inflammation by exerting antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions. The increased photoreceptor survival and visual performances in degenerated retinas, together with their high biocompatibility, make PtNPs a potential strategy to cure AMD.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety",,retinal disease,3
2023-11-29,37939210,MicroRNA-200 Loaded Lipid Nanoparticles Promote Intestinal Epithelium Regeneration in Canonical MicroRNA-Deficient Mice.,"Intestinal epithelium undergoes regeneration after injuries, and the disruption of this process can lead to inflammatory bowel disease and tumorigenesis. Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) residing in the crypts are crucial for maintaining the intestinal epithelium's homeostasis and promoting regeneration upon injury. However, the precise role of DGCR8, a critical component in microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis, in intestinal regeneration remains poorly understood. In this study, we provide compelling evidence demonstrating the indispensable role of epithelial miRNAs in the regeneration of the intestine in mice subjected to 5-FU or irradiation-induced injury. Through a comprehensive pooled screen of miRNA function in Dgcr8-deficient organoids, we observe that the loss of the miR-200 family leads to the hyperactivation of the p53 pathway, thereby reducing ISCs and impairing epithelial regeneration. Notably, downregulation of the miR-200 family and hyperactivation of the p53 pathway are verified in colonic tissues from patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC). Most importantly, the transient supply of miR-200 through the oral delivery of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) carrying miR-200 restores ISCs and promotes intestinal regeneration in mice following acute injury. Our study implies the miR-200/p53 pathway as a promising therapeutic target for active UC patients with diminished levels of the miR-200 family. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the clinical application of LNP-miRNAs could enhance the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of existing therapeutic modalities for intestinal diseases.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3
2023-11-29,37939611,Herba Patriniae and its component Isovitexin show anti-colorectal cancer effects by inducing apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest via p53 activation.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most prevalent cancer of the digestive tract. Herba Patriniae (also known as Bai Jiang Cao, HP) have been widely used to manage diarrhea, ulcerative colitis, and several cancers, including CRC. Nonetheless, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pharmacological action of HP on CRC remain unclear. This study investigated the underlying mechanisms of HP against CRC using network pharmacology analysis and in vitro and in vivo experiments. The results revealed nine bioactive compounds of HP. Furthermore, 3460 CRC-related targets of the identified active compounds were predicted from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Furthermore, 65 common targets were identified through the intersection of two related targets. Moreover, ten hub genes, including CDK4, CDK2, CDK1, CCND1, CCNB1, CCNA2, MYC, E2F1, CHEK1, and CDKN1A were identified through the topological analysis. Meanwhile, the GO and KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the core target genes were majorly enriched in the p53 and HIF-1 signaling pathways. Moreover, HP promoted apoptosis and suppressed cell proliferation by activating the p53 signaling pathway in a dose-dependent manner, while a similar effect was observed for Isovitexin (the primary component of HP). Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of HP and its component Isovitexin against CRC, providing a theoretical foundation for additional experimental verification of its clinical application.",no,yes,no,other,effectiveness,,ulcerative colitis,3

As in adult patients, sight-threatening ocular manifestations may lead to diagnosis. In this study, we aimed to report a series of cases of PBD with ocular manifestations and provide a review of the literature.Retrospective case series of PBD patients with ocular manifestations. Demographic, ophthalmological and systemic data at presentation and during follow-up were collected and analyzed.Four patients, aged 13.0 ± 2.9 years (9-16) were included. Posterior uveitis with retinal vasculitis, papillitis and macular edema was present in all patients, with associated anterior uveitis in 2 cases. Other features included occlusive vasculitis (2/4) and necrotizing retinitis (2/4). All patients were improved by systemic treatments except one patient with severe bilateral optic neuropathy. Ocular manifestations were the presenting symptoms in 3/4 cases.Ocular manifestations and systemic associations of PBD are comparable to those encountered in adult patients.

Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) is a component of the microenvironment associated with some autoimmune diseases. Previous studies have indicated that wet AMD patients have elevated serum IL-17A levels. However, the effect of IL-17A on AMD progression needs to be better understood. We aimed to investigate the role of IL-17A in a laser-induced CNV mouse model.We established a laser-induced CNV mouse model in wild-type (WT) and IL-17A-deficient mice and then evaluated the disease severity of these mice by using fluorescence angiography. We performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to analyze the levels of IL-17A and to investigate the immune cell populations in the eyes of WT and IL-17A-deficient mice. We used ARPE-19 cells to clarify the effect of IL-17A under oxidative stress.In the laser-induced CNV model, the CNV lesions were larger in IL-17A-deficient mice than in WT mice. The numbers of γδ T cells, CD3+CD4+RORγt+ T cells, Treg cells, and neutrophils were decreased and the number of macrophages was increased in the eyes of IL-17A-deficient mice compared with WT mice. In WT mice, IL-17A-producing γδ T-cell numbers increased in a time-dependent manner from day 7 to 28 after laser injury. IL-6 levels increased and IL-10, IL-24, IL-17F, and GM-CSF levels decreased in the eyes of IL-17A-deficient mice after laser injury. In vitro, IL-17A inhibited apoptosis and induced the expression of the antioxidant protein HO-1 in ARPE-19 cells under oxidative stress conditions. IL-17A facilitated the repair of oxidative stress-induced barrier dysfunction in ARPE-19 cells.Our findings provide new insight into the protective effect of IL-17A in a laser-induced CNV model and reveal a novel regulatory role of IL-17A-producing γδ T cells in the ocular microenvironment in wet AMD.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinal disease,3
2023-11-29,38012786,Application of patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells and organoids in inherited retinal diseases.,"Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) can induce severe sight-threatening retinal degeneration and impose a considerable economic burden on patients and society, making efforts to cure blindness imperative. Transgenic animals mimicking human genetic diseases have long been used as a primary research tool to decipher the underlying pathogenesis, but there are still some obvious limitations. As an alternative strategy, patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), particularly three-dimensional (3D) organoid technology, are considered a promising platform for modeling different forms of IRDs, including retinitis pigmentosa, Leber congenital amaurosis, X-linked recessive retinoschisis, Batten disease, achromatopsia, and best vitelliform macular dystrophy. Here, this paper focuses on the status of patient-derived iPSCs and organoids in IRDs in recent years concerning disease modeling and therapeutic exploration, along with potential challenges for translating laboratory research to clinical application. Finally, the importance of human iPSCs and organoids in combination with emerging technologies such as multi-omics integration analysis, 3D bioprinting, or microfluidic chip platform are highlighted.

2023-11-29,38013284,Network pharmacology identifies the inhibitory effect of Yiqiyangyinquyu prescription on salivary gland inflammation in Sjögren's syndrome.,"This study aimed to explore the mode of action of Yiqiyangyinquyu prescription (YP) against Sjögren's syndrome (SS) by combining network pharmacology with molecular docking techniques. YP's active components and target proteins were identified using the BATMAN-traditional Chinese medicine database. Concurrently, targets associated with SS were extracted from databases, including Genecards, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, and Therapeutic Target Database. The standard targets were then imported into the STRING database to construct a protein-protein interaction network. We then conducted gene ontology and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes enrichment analyses, which were succeeded by molecular docking studies to validate core active components and key targets. Finally, in vitro experiments and molecular dynamics simulation were conducted to substantiate the therapeutic efficacy of YP in treating SS. A total of 206 intersection targets and 46 active compounds were identified. Gene ontology analysis unveiled that YP targets were primarily enriched in cellular responses to chemical stress, inflammation, and cell proliferation. Key enriched signaling pathways encompassed the interleukin 17, hypoxia-inducible factor-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), and advanced glycation end products-receptor for AGEs (AGE-RAGE) signaling pathways. Molecular docking results demonstrated high-affinity between neotanshinone C, tanshiquinone B, miltionone I, TNF-α, interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Noteworthy, TNF-α, considered the most important gene in YP against SS, binds to YP most stably, which was further validated by molecular dynamics simulation. In vitro experiments confirmed YP's capacity to reduce TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 expression, effectively alleviating SS-related inflammation. YP demonstrated a significant anti-inflammatory effect by suppressing inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β), providing experimental evidence for its clinical application in treating SS.",no,yes,no,in vitro,effectiveness,,Sjögren's syndrome,3

Lupus retinopathy is reported in around 10% of patients with SLE; however, it is rarely the initial presenting feature of the disease. We report a unique case of bilateral retinal vasculitis as the initial presentation of SLE with secondary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). CASE REPORT A 34-year-old man, previously healthy, presented to the eye clinic for the first time with painless reduced vision for 3 weeks. A review of systems revealed generalized fatigue, myalgia, arthralgias, and weight loss of around 10 kg in the last 3 months. On ophthalmic examination, his visual acuity was reduced bilaterally, more in the right eye. A fundus exam revealed bilateral diffuse multiple cotton-wool spots, dot and blot hemorrhage covering the posterior pole, and venous congestion and beading. In addition, there was cystoid macular edema (CME) in the fovea of both eyes, and fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) showed bilateral areas of peripheral and macular hypo-fluorescence, multiple hyper-fluorescent knob-like aneurysmal dilatations, and vascular leaking and staining. He was diagnosed with SLE by the rheumatology team based on the clinical presentations and laboratory investigations. The patient was managed with intravenous methylprednisolone and discharged on oral prednisone with a tapering regimen. Eighteen months after, he reported significant improvement in his vision with regular follow-ups.

2023-11-29,38014839,N6-methyladenosine modification of TSC1 mRNA contributes to macrophage polarization regulated by Coptisine in DSS-induced ulcerative colitis.,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a global refractory disease characterized by recurrent episodes. Coptisine (COP) is an isoquinoline alkaloid derived from Coptis chinensis, which has strong anti-inflammatory activity. Macrophages are key cells mediating inflammation. It is reported that N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation regulates the polarization of macrophages and affects the development of inflammation. COP exerts an exact inhibitory effect on macrophages inflammation, while the specific mechanism remains unclear. The current study is designed to conduct a further investigation into the protective mechanism of COP against dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) -induced UC in mice.Using a DSS-induced UC model, we evaluated the pharmacodynamic effect of COP on UC mice, and verified the regulatory mechanism of COP on macrophage polarization in vivo and in vitro. The methylation level of m6A was detected by methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequence (MeRIP) -qPCR, and the expression level of Methyltransferase Like (METTL)14 was determined by western blotting. Then METTL14 was knocked down in macrophages, and its effects on Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1) mRNA and m6A methylation regulation were observed.COP improved the symptoms, alleviated tissue damage and reduced inflammation levels in DSS-induced UC mice. COP increased TSC1 expression, inhibited the Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) / Extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) signaling pathway, and thus inhibited macrophage M1 polarization, whereas COP increased CCAAT Enhancer Binding Protein beta (c/EBPβ) expression, and thus promoted macrophage M2 polarization. COP also significantly increased the expression of METTL14, which enhanced m6A methylation and ultimately improved the stability of TSC1 mRNA.COP was effective in treating UC and could regulate the polarization of macrophages. The possible mechanisms might be related to m6A modification-mediated TSC1.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3

GSK840, a small-molecule compound, was used to specifically inhibit RIPK3/MLKL-dependent necroptosis. Retinal structure and function evaluation was performed by using hematoxylin and eosin staining, optical coherence tomography, and electroretinography. Propidium Iodide (PI) staining was used for detection of necroptotic cell death, whereas Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence were used to assess necroptosis-related proteins and inner retinal neurons.RIPK3/MLKL-dependent necroptosis was rapidly activated in RGCs following retinal IR or OGDR. GSK840 helped maintain relatively normal inner retinal structure and thickness by preserving inner retinal neurons, particularly RGCs. Meanwhile, GSK840 ameliorated IR-induced visual dysfunction, as evidenced by the improved amplitudes of photopic negative response, a-wave, b-wave, and oscillatory potentials. And GSK840 treatment significantly reduced the population of PI+ RGCs after injury.

A total of 21 Sprague-Dawley rats were selected as the objects and divided into control (n=7), model (n=7) and inhibitor (n=7) groups. The rats in control group did not receive any treatment. The diabetic retinopathy model was established using streptozotocin and vascular endothelial growth factor in model group, while the rats in inhibitor group were treated with AMG 487, an inhibitor of the IP-10/CXCR3 signaling pathway, based on the treatment in model group. The changes in gene expression patterns in rats with diabetic retinopathy were screened by sequencing. After the differential genes were determined, the pathways mainly related to the complication were obtained via enrichment analysis. The expression of the IP-10/CXCR3 signaling pathway, the apoptotic cells and the expression of inflammatory molecules (IL-6, IL-12, TNF-α and IL-1β) in each group of rats were detected. It was shown in volcano plot that there were some differentially expressed genes (fold change >1.2, P<0.01) in retinal tissues of rats in control and model groups. Meanwhile, the heatmap displayed that there were great differences in the gene expression patterns between control and model groups, and the gene expressions of IP-10 and CXCR3 in model group were higher than those in control group (P<0.05). The differential genes in control and model groupwere enriched in such processes as the cAMP metabolic regulatory pathway, chemotaxis of immunocytes, proliferation of endothelial cells, response of cytokine receptors, apoptosis, mTOR signaling pathway and TGF-β-related signaling pathway. The mRNA expressions of IP-10 and CXCR3 in model group were higher than those in control group (P<0.05), while they were notably lower in inhibitor group than those in model group (P<0.05). Besides, the protein levels of IP-10 and CXCR3 were identical to the mRNA levels. The apoptotic cells were increased markedly in model group compared with those in control group (P<0.05) and inhibitor group (P<0.05). Model group exhibited higher expression levels of IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β in retinal tissues than control group (P<0.05), while inhibitor group had distinctly lower expression levels of IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β in retinal tissues than model group (P<0.05).

This study aimed at investigating the effects of the MIAT/miR-203-3p/SNAI2 axis on RIRI. RIRI was produced by inducing an exceedingly high intraocular pressure (IOP) in mice. Mouse retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) to mimic in vitro models. Relevant oligonucleotides or plasmids were transfected into OGD/R-induced RGCs in vitro or injected into RIRI mice models in vivo via a vitreous cavity. The findings of our paper indicated that MIAT and SNAI2 were highly expressed and miR-203-3p was lowly expressed in mouse RIRI tissues and OGD/R-induced RGCs. Interfering MIAT promoted the viability of OGD/R-induced RGCs, decreased apoptosis, and reduced oxidative stress in vitro. Silencing MIAT increased retinal neuronal cell numbers and decreased retinal neuronal cell apoptosis in mouse RIRI tissues in vivo. MIAT sponged miR-203-3p, and miR-203-3p targeted and inhibited SNAI2 expression. SNAI2 up-regulation or miR-203-3p down-regulation reversed the protective effects of MIAT down-regulation on RIRI in mice and OGD/R-induced RGCs. MIAT sponges miR-203-3p upregulated the expression of SNAI2, thereby promoting RIRI in mice. In summary, MIAT may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of chronic RIRI.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinal disease,3

The Ins2Akita (Akita) diabetic mouse presents the characteristics of DR and experimental drugs can be tested on this model to check their efficacy before going to the clinic. Topical administration of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) has been recently demonstrated to prevent DR in the Akita mouse, reverting the thinning of retinal layers and protecting the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) from death. In this study, we characterize the effects of topical NGF on neuroretina function, quantified with the electroretinogram (ERG). In particular, we show that NGF can ameliorate RGC conduction in the retina of Akita mice, which correlates with a recovery of retinal nerve fiber plus ganglion cell layer (RNFL-GCL) structure.

2023-11-30,37890757,Aberrant SUMO2/3 modification of RUNX1 upon SENP1 inhibition is linked to the development of diabetic retinopathy in mice.,"Our previous report established that RUNX family transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) promotes proliferation of mouse retinal microvascular endothelial cells (mRMECs) and exacerbates diabetic retinopathy (DR). However, the mechanism behind the upregulation of RUNX1 remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the possible correlation between histone SUMOylation and RUNX1 in DR, as well as the involved molecules. A mouse model of diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (STZ). These mice had increased retinal thickness and elevated production of inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, they showed elevated levels of SUMO1 and SUMO2/3, but reduced levels of SUMO specific peptidase 1 (SENP1) in retinal tissues. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot assays revealed that the RUNX1 protein was primarily modified by SUMO2/3, and SENP1 inhibited SUMO2/3 modification, thereby reducing RUNX1 expression. Overexpression of SENP1 alleviated symptoms in mice and alleviated inflammation. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the SENP1 overexpression suppressed the proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis of high-glucose-induced mRMECs. However, further overexpression of RUNX1 counteracted the alleviating effects of SENP1 both in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the downregulation of SENP1 in DR leads to SUMO2/3-dependent activation of RUNX1. This activation promotes proliferation of mRMECs and exacerbates DR symptoms in mice.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinopathy,3
2023-11-30,37898288,Canagliflozin ameliorates ulcerative colitis via regulation of TLR4/MAPK/NF-κB and Nrf2/PPAR-γ/SIRT1 signaling pathways.,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is one of the most common subtypes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that affects the colon and is characterized by severe intestinal inflammation. Canagliflozin is a widely used antihyperglycemic agent, a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor that enhances urinary glucose excretion. This study aims to provide insights into the potential benefits of canagliflozin as a treatment for UC by addressing possible cellular signals. Acetic acid (AA; 4% v/v) was administered intrarectally to induce colitis. Canagliflozin is given orally at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day. Canagliflozin attenuates inflammation in AA-induced colitis, evidenced by significant and dose-dependently downregulation of p38 MAPK, NF-κB-p65, IKK, IRF3, and NADPH-oxidase as well as colonic levels of IL-6 and IL-1β and MPO enzymatic activity. Canagliflozin mitigates colonic oxidative stress by decreasing MDA content and restoring SOD enzymatic activities and GSH levels mediated by co-activating of Nrf2, PPARγ, and SIRT1 pathways. Moreover, an in-silico study confirmed that canagliflozin was specific to all target proteins in this study. Canagliflozin's binding affinity with its target proteins indicates and confirms its effectiveness in regulating these pathways. Also, network pharmacology analysis supported that canagliflozin potently attenuates UC via a multi-target and multi-pathway approach.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3

Traditional treatment options for GA are limited, highlighting the need for new therapeutic approaches. In recent years, targeting the complement system has emerged as a promising strategy for the treatment of GA.This expert opinion article reviews the investigational drugs inhibiting the complement cascade for the treatment of GA. Specifically, it focuses on the recent FDA approved pegcetacoplan, a C3 complement inhibitor, and avacincaptad pegol, a C5 complement inhibitor, highlighting their potential efficacy and safety profiles based on clinical trial data.FDA approval of intravitreal pegcetacoplan and avacincaptad pegol marks significant progress in the landscape of GA treatment. However, variable results from trials underscore the complex nature of GA and the importance of patient selection.

2023-11-30,37956941,Blockade of interleukin-6 trans-signaling prevents mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular senescence in retinal endothelial cells.,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a multifaceted cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Its activity extends through cis- and trans-signaling (TS) pathways, with cis-signaling limited to specific cell types possessing the membrane-bound IL-6 receptor, while trans-signaling broadly activates various cells without the membrane bound IL-6 receptor, including retinal endothelial cells. In this study, we determined the effects of interleukin-6 trans-signaling on mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular senescence in human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs). HRECs were cultured and treated with IL-6 + soluble IL-6R or Hyper IL-6 to activate trans-signaling, along with sgp130Fc for inhibition. RT-PCR was used to analyze gene expression changes associated with inflammation and senescence. Cellular senescence was assessed using SA β-gal staining. Mitochondrial function was evaluated using Seahorse XFe24 Bioanalyzer. IL-6 trans-signaling induced inflammatory gene expression as indicated by the upregulation of ICAM1, MCP1, and SERPINA3 levels. Additionally, it reduced mitochondrial respiration and oxidative phosphorylation, and these effects were counteracted by sgp130Fc. Moreover, IL-6 trans-signaling led to altered expression of apoptosis-associated genes, including downregulation of FIS1, BCL2, and MCL1, while promoting cellular senescence, a phenomenon mitigated by sgp130Fc. These results not only deepen our understanding of IL-6 in DR but also carry broader implications for age-related diseases and the aging process itself. This study underscores the potential therapeutic value of targeting IL-6 trans-signaling with sgp130Fc as a promising anti-inflammatory approach for DR and potentially other inflammatory conditions. Further in-vivo investigations are warranted to elucidate the function of IL-6 trans-signaling in aging-related pathologies and overall organismal health.",no,yes,no,in vitro,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinopathy,3
2023-11-30,38016793,Patient perspectives and barriers in the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration in Denmark: a qualitative study.,"This qualitative study aims to identify patient-reported barriers to treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and investigate their impact on quality of life.Using a qualitative explorative design.Semi-structured individual or dyadic interviews were conducted with patients and their relatives.Twenty-one patients completed the interview, with four of them having a relative present.Gadamer's hermeneutics guided the epistemological approach, and maximum variation sampling was employed to capture diverse patient experiences. An advisory board consisting of patients, relatives and ophthalmologists ensured the relevance of the study. Thematic analysis was conducted using NVivo software.To investigate patient-reported barriers to the recommended treatment for nAMD and impact on quality of life.The study included 21 patients with nAMD, with a median age of 79 years. Five themes emerged: (1) good compliance with intravitreal treatment, (2) the dual role of relatives, (3) treatment commute, (4) hospital barriers, (5) preventive health literacy.This study highlights the resilience and adherence of patients with nAMD in Denmark to their treatment despite various barriers. While the therapy may have negative effects on their well-being, patients do not opt out of treatment. These findings underscore the importance of personalised treatment plans that provide, for example, convenient access to care and clear future agreements at the hospital. By adopting more patient-centred approaches, healthcare providers can enhance patient satisfaction and improve treatment adherence, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes and quality of life.",no,yes,no,other,effectiveness,,retinal disease,3
2023-11-30,38017509,Bilateral co-secretory lesions presenting with coexisting Cushing syndrome and primary aldosteronism: a case report.,"There is an increasing number of cases of aldosterone- and cortisol-producing adenomas (A/CPAs) reported in the context of primary aldosteronism (PA). Most of these patients have PA complicated with subclinical Cushing's syndrome; cases of apparent Cushing's syndrome (CS) complicated with aldosteronism are less reported. However, Co-secretory tumors were present in the right adrenal gland, a cortisol-secreting adenoma and an aldosterone-producing nodule (APN) were present in the left adrenal gland, and aldosterone-producing micronodules (APMs) were present in both adrenal glands, which has not been reported. Here, we report such a case, offering profound insight into the diversity of clinical and pathological features of this disease.The case was a 45-year-old female from the adrenal disease diagnosis and treatment centre in West China Hospital of Sichuan University. The patient presented with hypertension, moon-shaped face, central obesity, fat accumulation on the back of the neck, disappearance of cortisol circadian rhythm, ACTH < 5 ng/L, failed elevated cortisol inhibition by dexamethasone, orthostatic aldosterone/renin activity > 30 (ng/dL)/(ng/mL/h), and plasma aldosterone concentration > 10 ng/dL after saline infusion testing. Based on the above, she was diagnosed with non-ACTH-dependent CS complicated with PA. Adrenal vein sampling showed no lateralization for cortisol and aldosterone secretion in the bilateral adrenal glands. The left adrenocortical adenoma was removed by robot-assisted laparoscopic resection. However, hypertension, fatigue and weight gain were not alleviated after surgery; additionally, purple striae appeared in the lower abdomen, groin area and inner thigh, accompanied by systemic joint pain. One month later, the right adrenocortical adenoma was also removed. CYP11B1 were expressed in the bilateral adrenocortical adenomas, and CYP11B2 was also expressed in the right adrenocortical adenomas. APN existed in the left adrenal gland and APMs in the adrenal cortex adjacent to bilateral adrenocortical adenomas. After another surgery, her serum cortisol and plasma aldosterone returned to normal ranges, except for slightly higher ACTH.This case suggests that it is necessary to assess the presence of PA, even in CS with apparent symptoms. As patients with CS and PA may have more complicated adrenal lesions, more data are required for diagnosis.",no,yes,no,other,"effectiveness, safety",,Cushing's syndrome,3
2023-11-30,38018498,Neuroprotective Effects of Human Adipose-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Oxygen-Induced Retinopathy.,"This study was designed to provide evidence of the neuroprotective of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADSCs) in oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). In vivo, hADSCs were intravitreally injected into OIR mice. Various assessments, including HE (histological evaluation), TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling) staining, electroretinogram (ERG) analysis, and retinal flat-mount examination, were performed separately at postnatal days 15 (P15) and 17 (P17) to evaluate neurological damage and functional changes. Western blot analysis of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was conducted at P17 to elucidate the neuroprotective mechanism. The P17 OIR group exhibited a significant increase in vascular endothelial cell nuclei and neovascularization that breached the ILM (inner limiting membrane) to the P17 control group. In addition, the retinal nonperfusion areas in the P17 OIR group and the number of apoptotic retinal cells in the P15 OIR group were significantly higher than in the corresponding hADSCs treatment group and control group. There was no significant thickness change in the inner nuclear layer (INL) but the outer nuclear layer (ONL) in the P17 OIR treatment group compared with the P17 OIR group. The cell density in the INL and ONL at P17 in the hADSCs treatment group was not significantly different from the OIR group. The amplitude of a-wave and b-wave in scotopic ERG analysis for the P17 OIR group was significantly lower than in the P17 hADSCs treatment group and the P17 control group. Furthermore, the latency of the a-wave and b-wave in the P17 OIR group was significantly longer than in the P17 hADSCs treatment group and the P17 control group. In addition, the expression levels of CNTF and BDNF in the P17 OIR group were statistically higher than those in the P17 control group, whereas the expression of GDNF was statistically lower in the P17 OIR group, compared with the P17 control group. The expression of CNTF and GDNF in the P17 hADSCs treatment group was statistically higher than in the P17 OIR group. However, the expression of BDNF in the P17 hADSCs treatment group was statistically lower than in the P17 OIR group.

Vahl extract ameliorates ulcerative colitis via inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation through the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway.,"Ulcerative colitis (UC), a chronic inflammatory disease, is caused by abnormal immune system reactions resulting in inflammation and ulcers in the large intestine. Phillygenin (PHI) is a natural compound found in Forsythia suspensa (Thunb.) Vahl, which is known for its antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, antiobesity, and other biological activities. However, the therapeutic role and molecular mechanisms of PHI on UC are still insufficiently researched.In this study, dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and 2.5% 2,4,6-trinitro-Benzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced acute UC were used to investigate the therapeutic effects of PHI. We evaluated the effects of PHI on disease activity index (DAI), body weight, mortality, intestinal mucosal barrier, cytokine secretion, and macrophage infiltration into colon tissue using various techniques such as flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), RT-qPCR, and Western blot analysis.Our findings revealed that PHI has therapeutic properties in UC treatment. PHI was able to maintain body weight, reduce DAI and mortality, restore the intestinal mucosal barrier, and inhibit cytokine secretion. Flow cytometry assay and immunofluorescence indicated that PHI reduces macrophage infiltration into colon tissue. Mechanistically, PHI may exert anti-inflammatory effects by downregulating the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway and inhibiting the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.In conclusion, PHI possesses significant anti-inflammatory properties and is expected to be a potential drug for UC treatment. Our study delves into the underlying mechanisms of PHI therapy and highlights the potential for further research in developing PHI-based treatments for UC.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,3
2023-11-30,38018589,Long-term oral administration of burdock fructooligosaccharide alleviates DSS-induced colitis in mice by mediating anti-inflammatory effects and protection of intestinal barrier function.,"Ulcerative colitis, a typical subtype of inflammatory bowel disease, can cause many serious complications. Burdock fructooligosaccharide (BFO), a linear inulin with a purity of 99.439% and a molecular weight of 2345 Da, demonstrates anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties.The Kunming mice were divided into two experimental models: a normal pretreatment model and a colitis experimental model. During the experimental treatment period, we assessed changes in weight and disease activity index (DAI), quantified the intestinal index, and determined myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and reactive oxide species (ROS) levels in colitis mice. We also photographed colon morphology to investigate alterations in the integrity of the intestinal barrier function. Finally, we performed ELISA and qRT-PCR to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of BFO treatment on colitis mice.The long-term oral administration of BFO alone exhibited protective effects by preventing disruption of the intestinal functional structure and increasing the colon index in mice. However, in a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model, BFO administration facilitated quick recovery of body weight and effectively reduced the DAI, especially in the BFO-H group (500 mg/kg/day). BFO treatment maintained the integrity of the intestinal barrier by attenuating the crypt distortion and increasing the goblet cells count It restored the DSS-induced colon shortening and reduced the symptoms of colitis. These effects may be attributed to the appropriate concentrations of BFO effectively inhibiting MPO activity, clearing excessive ROS, and relieving spleen abnormalitie. BFO also attenuated the overexpression and excessive secretion of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and MCP-1) induced by DSS, reduced intestinal inflammation, and consequently protected the intestinal barrier function.BFO effectively alleviated the symptoms of DSS-induced colitis by mediating anti-inflammatory effects and protecting the intestinal barrier integrity, thereby potentially facilitating the utilization of safer and more efficacious polysaccharides for managing chronic inflammatory diseases.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety",,ulcerative colitis,3
2023-11-30,38019490,Too Much of a Good Thing: Extended Duration of Gut Microbiota Depletion Reverses Protection From Experimental Autoimmune Uveitis.,"Using the model of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) induced by immunization with a retinal antigen, two studies have reported contradictory results on disease development following oral antibiotic treatment (ABX). We showed that long-term ABX did not affect EAU, but another study showed that short-term ABX was protective. We therefore studied the effects of ABX on EAU, gut microbiota, and host immune responses as a function of treatment duration.EAU-susceptible mice were treated orally with broad-spectrum antibiotics starting at least 10 weeks (long-term) or 1 week (short-term) before immunization until termination of the experiment. Gut microbiota were characterized by 16S amplicon sequencing, and host gut immune elements were studied phenotypically and functionally.Long-term ABX had no effect, whereas short-term ABX delayed EAU, as previously reported by us and others, respectively. Microbial sequencing revealed progressive reduction of gut microbiota that showed some differences in the two ABX groups. Interestingly, duration of ABX was associated with a gradual disappearance of the CD4+ and CD4+CD8+ subset of gut intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). This IEL subset is microbiota dependent and is absent in germ-free mice. Relative abundance of Lactobacillus reuteri correlated with the frequencies of CD4+CD8+ IELs. IELs suppressed antigen-specific activation of autoreactive T cells in culture.Gut microbiota may play dual roles in uveitis development: They promote EAU development but also help maintain IEL populations that have regulatory function against autoreactive T cells. We propose that the progressive loss of this population during long-term ABX reverses the EAU-ameliorating effects of microbiota depletion.",no,yes,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,retinal disease,3

In this case-control study, 56 eyes of 29 axSpA patients and 61 eyes of 31 healthy controls (HCs) were evaluated using OCT-A. The capillary plexus density (CPD) of vessels in the parafovea and perifovea regions was evaluated from the superficial capillary plexus (SCP) and deep capillary plexus (DPC) flow areas. The CPD of vessels in the fundus was evaluated from the radial peripapillary capillary (RPC) flow area. Foveal avascular zone (FAZ) size was measured. In axSpA patients and HCs, the mean CPD (%) in the whole retina was 50.75 ± 2.59 and 52.43 ± 2.10 (p < 0.001) in SCP, 54.00 ± 5.83 and 58.37 ± 4.36 (p < 0.001) in DCP, and 50.13 ± 2.32 and 50.13 ± 2.26 (p = 0.984) in RPC flow areas, respectively, and the mean FAZ (mm) was 0.275 ± 0.10 and 0.294 ± 0.07 (p = 0.281), respectively. A significant negative correlation was detected between the CPD and disease duration in the parafovea (ρ: - 0.306, p = 0.022), parafovea superior-hemi (ρ = - 0299, p = 0.025), parafovea inferior-hemi (ρ = - 0.270, p = 0.044), parafovea temporal (ρ = - 0.349, p = 0.008) and parafovea nasal regions (ρ = - 0.356, p = 0.007) in the DCP flow area. CPD was found to be lower in the macula, while similar in the fundus region in axSpA patients compared to HCs. The decrease in CPD was correlated with disease duration, but not with disease activity in axSpA. Small vessel structures may be affected in axSpA.

His examination revealed signs of retinal vascular disease in both eyes, with an ophthalmic artery occlusion in his affected left eye and a hemiretinal vein occlusion in his asymptomatic right eye. An extensive medical workup was significant for HIV positivity; he was ultimately diagnosed with AIDS, and ocular findings were attributed to an associated occlusive vasculitis. He developed anterior segment neovascularization in the left eye for which he received intravitreal bevacizumab and panretinal photocoagulation. He ultimately required cyclophotocoagulation in the left eye for poorly controlled intraocular pressure in the setting of neovascular glaucoma.Although HIV is most classically associated with a retinal microangiopathy, testing should be considered in cases of occlusive retinal vasculitis because it is a rare cause of such findings.",no,yes,no,other,diagnostic,,retinal disease,2

Optical coherence tomography demonstrated focal retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) thickening that corresponded to the hyperreflective lesions on NIR. On subsequent optical coherence tomography scans, the hyperreflective areas resolved with the development of ellipsoid zone attenuation, RPE disruption, and atrophy, which colocalized with hyporeflectivity on NIR.This report describes the progression of pentosan polysulfate maculopathy over almost 10 years of PPS treatment and highlights the importance of NIR as a tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of PPS maculopathy. Pentosan polysulfate lesions present as areas of focal RPE thickening with ensuing development of ellipsoid zone loss and RPE drop-out.

Three patients of two families who had poor vision since infancy were studied. Genetic testing of the ATOH7 gene was performed.The three patients had varying degrees of intraocular vascular proliferation associated with advanced retinal detachments as falciform retinal folds or total retinal detachments. This state is referred to as congenital retinal nonattachment. One eye of a sibling had fluorescein angiographic findings of excessive branching of the retinal vessels and fluorescent dye leakage that were consistent with those of familial exudative vitreoretinopathy. Bilateral hypoplasia of the optic nerve was found in all three patients by magnetic resonance imaging. Genetic analysis showed a known in-frame deletion of the ATOH7 gene in all three patients.This is the first report of a patient with a mutation in the ATOH7 gene that had typical vascular patterns of familial exudative vitreoretinopathy in the peripheral retina.

Images were classified based on the international classification for DR. Sensitivity, specificity, kappa statistics (K/Kw) were calculated on an eye and person-level.Distribution of DR severity by AU/UWF images (%) by eye was no DR 41.3/36.0, mild non-proliferative DR (NPDR) 18.7/17.8, moderate 10.2/10.7, severe 16.4/15.1, proliferative DR (PDR) 13.3/20.4. Agreement between UWF and AU was exact in 64.4%, within 1-step 90.7%, k = 0.55 (95% CI:0.45-0.65), and kw = 0.79 (95% CI:0.73-0.85) by eye, and exact in 68%, within 1-step 92.9%, k = 0.58 (95% CI:0.50-0.66), and kw = 0.76 (95% CI:0.70-0.81) by person.

2023-11-01,37002809,The adhesion G protein-coupled receptor VLGR1/ADGRV1 controls autophagy.,"VLGR1/ADGRV1 (very large G protein-coupled receptor-1) is the largest known adhesion G protein-coupled receptor. Mutations in VLGR1/ADGRV1 cause Usher syndrome (USH), the most common form of hereditary deaf-blindness, and have been additionally linked to epilepsy. Although VLGR1/ADGRV1 is almost ubiquitously expressed, little is known about the subcellular function and signalling of the VLGR1 protein and thus about mechanisms underlying the development of diseases. Using affinity proteomics, we identified key components of autophagosomes as putative interacting proteins of VLGR1. In addition, whole transcriptome sequencing of the retinae of the Vlgr1/del7TM mouse model revealed altered expression profiles of gene-related autophagy. Monitoring autophagy by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry of the LC3 and p62 as autophagy marker proteins revealed evoked autophagy in VLGR1-deficient hTERT-RPE1 cells and USH2C patient-derived fibroblasts. Our data demonstrate the molecular and functional interaction of VLGR1 with key components of the autophagy process and point to an essential role of VLGR1 in the regulation of autophagy at internal membranes. The close association of VLGR1 with autophagy helps to explain the pathomechanisms underlying human USH and epilepsy related to VLGR1 defects.",no,yes,no,animal,biomarker,,retinal disease,2

2023-11-01,37572202,Retinal microvascular complexity as a putative biomarker of biological age: a pilot study.,"Physiological changes associated with aging increase the risk for the development of age-related diseases. This increase is non-specific to the type of age-related disease, although each disease develops through a unique pathophysiologic mechanism. People who age at a faster rate develop age-related diseases earlier in their life. They have an older ""biological age"" compared to their ""chronological age"". Early detection of individuals with accelerated aging would allow timely intervention to postpone the onset of age-related diseases. This would increase their life expectancy and their length of good quality life. The goal of this study was to investigate whether retinal microvascular complexity could be used as a biomarker of biological age. Retinal images of 68 participants ages ranging from 19 to 82 years were collected in an observational cross-sectional study. Twenty of the old participants had age-related diseases such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and/or Alzheimer's dementia. The rest of the participants were healthy. Retinal images were captured by a hand-held, non-mydriatic fundus camera and quantification of the microvascular complexity was performed by using Sholl's, box-counting fractal, and lacunarity analysis. In the healthy subjects, increasing chronological age was associated with lower retinal microvascular complexity measured by Sholl's analysis. Decreased box-counting fractal dimension was present in old patients, and this decrease was 2.1 times faster in participants who had age-related diseases (p = 0.047). Retinal microvascular complexity could be a promising new biomarker of biological age. The data from this study is the first of this kind collected in Montenegro.

2023-11-01,37788001,Diabetes Reshapes the Circadian Transcriptome Profile in Murine Retina.,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common complication of diabetes and has a high prevalence. Dysregulation of circadian rhythmicity is associated with the development of DR. This research aimed to investigate rhythmical transcriptome alterations in the retina of diabetic mice.C57BL/6J mice were used to establish a diabetes model by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ). After 12 weeks, retinas were collected continuously at 4-hour intervals over 1 day. Total RNA was extracted from normal and STZ-treated retinas and RNA sequencing was performed. Meta2d algorithm, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes, Phase Set Enrichment Analysis, and time-series cluster analysis were used to identify, analyze and annotate the composition, phase, and molecular functions of rhythmic transcripts in retinas.The retina exhibited powerful transcriptome rhythmicity. STZ-induced diabetes markedly modified the transcriptome characteristics of the circadian transcriptome in the retina, including composition, phase, and amplitude. Moreover, the diabetic mice led to re-organized temporal and clustering enrichment pathways in space and time and affected core clock machinery.Diabetes impairs the circadian rhythm of the transcriptomic profile of retinas. This study offers new perspectives on the negative effects of diabetes on the retina, which may provide important information for the development of new treatments for DR.",no,yes,no,animal,biomarker,,retinopathy,2
2023-11-01,37788003,Optical Density Ratio of Subretinal Fluid in Choroidal Melanomas Versus Choroidal Naevi Assessed by Optical Coherence Tomography.,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether optical density ratio (ODR) of subretinal fluid (SRF) on optical coherence tomography (OCT) differs between choroidal naevi and melanomas.One hundred ninety-nine patients (one eye per patient) presenting choroidal melanoma or choroidal naevus with SRF on OCT, evaluated between February and June 2019, were retrospectively included. Other retinal conditions, opaque media, and low-quality OCT were excluded. Mean pixel intensity of SRF (range = 0-255) was quantified using a semi-automated procedure by a masked observer on standard horizontal OCT sections. Mean vitreous intensity served as the reference for ODR.One hundred twenty-eight patients with choroidal melanoma and 71 patients with choroidal naevus were included in this study. ODR (mean ± SD) was higher in melanomas (181 ± 64) than in naevi (78 ± 48, P < 0.0001). ODR was correlated to lesion thickness (P < 0.0001, r = 0.27), largest basal diameter (P = 0.028, r = 0.16) and, among naevi, to the number of risk factors for growth into melanoma (P = 0.032, r = 0.22). Among 110 patients with naevi or melanoma who underwent fluorescein angiography, ODR was 120.7 ± 550.1 in eyes presenting angiographic pinpoints versus 14.19 ± 26.0 in eyes that did not (P = 0.06). Fourteen eyes with naevi that transformed into melanoma over 3 years had a mean baseline ODR of 94.7 ± 243.5 compared to 4.01 ± 9.74 in 28 matched naevi eyes of similar size that did not transform (P = 0.027).SRF ODR is higher in choroidal melanoma compared to choroidal naevi. This OCT-derived imaging marker is also higher in choroidal naevi with the potential to transform into melanoma, compared to stationary naevi.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"diagnostic, biomarker",,"retinopathy, retinal disease",2
2023-11-01,37789460,Fecal short chain fatty acids and urinary 3-indoxyl sulfate do not discriminate between patients with Crohn´s disease and ulcerative colitis and are not of diagnostic utility for predicting disease severity.,"Urinary 3-indoxyl sulfate levels as well as fecal short chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations are surrogate markers for gut microbiota diversity. Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a disease closely associated with IBD, have decreased microbiome diversity. In this paper, the fecal SCFAs propionate, acetate, butyrate and isobutyrate of patients with IBD and patients with PSC-IBD and urinary 3-indoxyl sulfate of IBD patients were determined to study associations with disease etiology and severity.SCFA levels in feces of 64 IBD patients and 20 PSC-IBD patients were quantified by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Urinary 3-indoxyl sulfate levels of 45 of these IBD patients were analysed by means of reversed-phase liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Feces of 17 healthy controls and urine of 13 of these controls were analyzed in parallel. These cohorts had comparable sex distribution and age.Urinary 3-indoxyl sulfate concentrations (normalized to urinary creatinine levels) was increased (P = 0.030) and fecal isobutyrate levels (normalized to dry weight of the stool sample) of IBD patients were decreased (P = 0.035) in comparison to healthy controls. None of the analyzed metabolites differed between patients with Crohn´s disease (CD) and patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Fecal acetate and butyrate positively correlated with fecal calprotectin (P = 0.040 and P = 0.005, respectively) and serum C-reactive protein (P = 0.024 and P = 0.025, respectively) in UC but not CD patients. UC patients with fecal calprotectin levels above 150 µg/g, indicating intestinal inflammatory activity, had higher fecal acetate (P = 0.016), butyrate (P = 0.007) and propionate (P = 0.046) in comparison to patients with fecal calprotectin levels < 50 µg/g. Fecal SCFA levels of PSC-IBD and IBD patients were comparable.Current findings suggest that analysis of urinary 3-indoxyl-sulfate as well as fecal SCFAs has no diagnostic value for IBD and PSC-IBD diagnosis or monitoring of disease severity.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"diagnostic, biomarker",,"crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis",2

The purpose of this study was to determine the types of inflammatory cells involved in IRDs, by deep profiling the composition of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with a CRB1-associated IRD.This study included 33 patients with an IRD with confirmed CRB1 mutations and 32 healthy controls. A 43-parameter flow cytometry analysis was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from venous blood. FlowSOM and manual Boolean combination gating were used to identify and quantify immune cell subsets.Comparing patients with controls revealed a significant increase in patients in the abundance of circulating CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells that express sialyl Lewis X antigen. Furthermore, we detected a decrease in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and an IgA+CD24+CD38+ transitional B-cell subset in patients with an IRD.Patients with a CRB1-associated IRD show marked changes in blood leukocyte composition, affecting lymphocyte and dendritic cell populations.

In terms of primary or secondary diagnoses, 68% of patients had valve disease, 46.9% had AF and 29.2% had HF. A cardiac diagnosis was made in 85.9%. In multivariable analyses, NT-proBNP predicted HF with LVEF<40% (OR: 10.2, 95% CI: 5.63 to 18.3) and HF with any LVEF (OR: 6.13, 95% CI: 3.79 to 9.93). In canonical linear discriminant analyses, NT-proBNP correctly identified 54.5% of patients with HF. The remainder were misclassified as valvular disease, AF or no cardiac diagnosis.Among patients with an NT-proBNP>400 ng/L referred through a primary care HF pathway, most patients had valve disease or AF rather than HF. NT-proBNP cannot discriminate among HF, valve disease and AF. On this basis, NT-proBNP may be best employed in detecting cardiac disease in general rather than HF per se.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,diagnostic,natriuretic,,2
2023-11-01,37796490,Deep Optic Nerve Head Morphology in Tilted Disc Syndrome and Its Clinical Implication on Visual Damage.,"To study deep optic nerve head (ONH) morphology in tilted disc syndrome (TDS) and identify factors associated with retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) defect.In patients with TDS, we evaluated the optic disc shape using the Bruch's membrane opening (BMO)-anterior scleral canal opening (ASCO) offset and measured the border tissue (BT) length, depth, and angle in the direction of the tilt, using radial ONH optical coherence tomography (OCT). We compared the parameters between the TDS groups with and without RNFL defects.Twenty-one eyes had no glaucomatous RNFL defect, and 38 eyes had a glaucomatous RNFL defect. The group with RNFL defects had a higher baseline IOP, larger tilt axis of BMO-ASCO optic disc margin (76.4° ± 14.5° vs. 87.9° ± 15.4°, P = 0.012), larger BMO-lamina cribrosa insertion (LCI) angle (25.6° ± 9.3° vs. 43.6° ± 15.2°, P < 0.001), and more lamina cribrosa (LC) defects (4.3% vs. 30.6%, P = 0.028) than without RNFL defects. The tilt axis and BMO-LCI angle were significant factors after adjusting for baseline IOP and LC defect. The BMO-LCI angle had excellent diagnostic power for glaucomatous RNFL defect in TDS, similar to the visual field mean deviation.OCT-based large deep ONH BT angle and tilt axis were factors associated with the presence of RNFL defects in TDS. The results suggest a mechanism of RNFL defect associated with structural ONH deformation. Further investigations are warranted to understand the role of ONH structures in a general population with and without optic disc tilt.",no,yes,no,other,diagnostic,,retinal disease,2
2023-11-01,37797984,5 Tear proteins in premature babies at risk of retinopathy of prematurity.,"This feasibility study aimed to investigate the feasibility of collecting and analysing tear proteins from preterm infants at risk of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Additionally, we sought to identify any tear proteins which might be implicated in the pathophysiology of ROP.Eligible infants were those undergoing ROP screening without other ocular pathology. Tear samples were obtained by Schirmer's test strips coincident with routine ROP screening. Mass spectrometry was used for proteomic analysis. All participants' parents gave written, informed consent.Samples were collected from 12 infants, including two sets of twins. Gestation ranged from 25+6 to 31+1 weeks. Median postnatal age at sampling was 30.5 days (range 19 to 66). One infant developed self-limiting ROP. An adequate sample for protein analysis was obtained from each infant. 701 proteins were identified; 261 proteins identified in the majority of tear samples, including several common tear proteins, were used for analyses.Increased risk of ROP as determined by G-ROP prediction criteria was associated with an increase in lactate dehydrogenase B (LDH-B) chain protein in tears. Older, more mature infants demonstrated increased concentration of immunoglobulin complexes within their tear samples and two sets of twins in the cohort showed exceptionally similar proteomes, supporting validity of the analysis.Tear sampling by Schirmer test strips and subsequent proteomic analysis in preterm infants is feasible. A larger study is required to investigate the potential use of tear proteomics in early identification of ROP.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinopathy,2
2023-11-01,37798369,Risk of incident autoimmune diseases in patients with newly diagnosed psoriatic disease: a nationwide population-based study.,"There are limited large population-based cohort studies on the risk of incident autoimmune diseases among patients with newly diagnosed psoriatic disease. The objective of this study was to assess the risk of autoimmune diseases in patients with newly diagnosed psoriatic disease. Using the Korean National Health Insurance Service database, patients with newly diagnosed psoriatic disease between 2007 and 2019 were included. Comparators were randomly selected and matched according to age and sex. A total of 321,354 patients with psoriatic disease and 321,354 matched comparators were included in this study. Patients with psoriatic disease had a significantly higher risk of Crohn's disease [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), 1.95; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42-2.67], ulcerative colitis (aHR, 1.65; 95% CI 1.39-1.96), systemic lupus erythematosus (aHR, 1.86; 95% CI 1.34-2.57), rheumatoid arthritis (aHR, 1.63; 95% CI 1.52-1.76), ankylosing spondylitis (aHR, 2.32; 95% CI 1.95-2.77), alopecia areata (aHR, 1.41; 95% CI 1.35-1.46), and type 1 diabetes (aHR, 1.23; 95% CI 1.11-1.37). However, the risk of Graves' disease, Hashimoto's disease, Sjögren's syndrome, and systemic sclerosis was not significantly different between the groups.

2023-11-01,37802408,Assessment of amino-terminal C-type natriuretic peptide serum level and its correlation with high-density lipoprotein structure and function in patients with end stage renal disease before and after kidney transplantation.,"We aimed to investigate serum amino-terminal C-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proCNP) and its relationship with quantitative and qualitative HDL-parameters in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) before, then 1 and 6 months after kidney transplantation (TX). Seventy patients (47 males, 23 females, mean age 51.7 ± 12.4 years) were enrolled in a prospective follow-up study. We examined serum creatinine, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, fasting glucose and lipid parameters before, then 1 and 6 months after TX. High-density lipoprotein- (HDL)-associated paraoxonase-1 (PON1) paraoxonase and arylesterase activities were measured spectrophotometrically. Lipoprotein subfractions were determined by Lipoprint. NT-proCNP and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) levels were measured by ELISA. Mean NT-proCNP was 45.8 ± 21.9 pmol/L before renal transplantation and decreased markedly 1 month and 6 months after transplantation (5.3 ± 2.5 and 7.7 ± 4.9 pmol/L, respectively, P = 1 × 10-4). During the 6 months' follow-up, PON1 arylesterase, paraoxonase and salt-stimulated paraoxonase activities improved. NT-proCNP positively correlated with procalcitonin and creatinine and negatively with GFR, LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C). There was a negative correlation between serum NT-proCNP and PON1 arylesterase activity. According to the multiple regression analysis, the best predicting variables of NT-proCNP were serum procalcitonin, creatinine and PON1 arylesterase activity. NT-proCNP might be a novel link between HDL dysfunction and impaired vascular function in ESRD, but not after kidney transplantation. Further studies in larger populations are needed to clarify the exact role of NT-proCNP in the risk prediction for cardiovascular comorbidities and complications in ESRD.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,natriuretic,,2

A metagenome assay was used to compare the microbiome composition and function of the ocular surface between diabetic children and adolescents with dry eye, diabetic children and adolescents without dry eye, and normal children.Twenty children and adolescents aged 8 to 16 with diabetes were selected from the Shanghai Children and Adolescent Diabetes Eye Study. Ten healthy children and adolescents belonging to the same age group were selected from the outpatient clinic during the same period. The participants were classified into the dry eye group (DM-DE group, n = 10), the non-dry eye group (DM-NDE group, n = 10) and the normal group (NDM group, n = 10). A conjunctival sac swab was collected for metagenomic sequencing, and the relationship between the microbiome composition and functional gene differences on the ocular surface with dry eye was studied.The classification composition and metabolic function of the microorganisms on the ocular surface of children in the 3 groups were analyzed. It was found that children's ocular microbiota was composed of bacteria, viruses and fungi. There were significant differences in α diversity and β diversity of microbial composition of ocular surface between DM-DE group and NDM group(P<0.05). There were significant differences in α and β diversity of metabolic pathways between the two groups(P<0.05). The functional pathways of ocular surface microorganisms in diabetic children with dry eyes were mainly derived from human disease, antibiotic resistance genes, carbohydrate, coenzyme and lipid transport and metabolism-related functional genes; In normal children, the functional pathways were mainly derived from replication, recombination, repair, signal transduction and defense-related functional genes.The DM-DE group have unique microbial composition and functional metabolic pathways.

2023-11-01,37803473,Study protocol of OmegaROP-2 prospective study: expression of placental fatty acid receptors in preterm newborns with retinopathy of prematurity.,"Incomplete vascularization of the retina in preterm infants carries a risk of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Progress in neonatal resuscitation in developing countries has led to the survival of an increasing number of premature infants, resulting in an increased rate of ROP and consequently in visual disability. Strategies to reduce ROP involve optimizing oxygen saturation, nutrition, and normalizing factors such as insulin-like growth factor 1 and n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA). Our previous study, OmegaROP, showed that there is an accumulation or retention of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in mothers of infants developing ROP, suggesting abnormalities in the LC-PUFA placental transfer via fatty acid transporting proteins. The present study aims to better understand the LC-PUFA transport dysfunction in the fetoplacental unit during pregnancy and to find a novel target for the prevention of ROP development.The study protocol is designed to evaluate the correlation between the expression level of placental fatty acid receptors and ROP occurrence. This ongoing study will include 100 mother-infant dyads: mother-infant dyads born before 29 weeks of gestational age (GA) and mother-infant dyads with full-term pregnancies. Recruitment is planned over a period of 46 months. Maternal and cord blood samples as well as placental tissue samples will be taken following delivery. ROP screening will be performed using wide-field camera imaging according to the International Classification of ROP consensus statement.The results of this study will have a tangible impact on public health. Indeed, if we show a correlation between the expression level of placental omega-3 receptors and the occurrence of ROP, it would be an essential step in discovering novel pathophysiological mechanisms involved in this retinopathy.NCT04819893.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinopathy,2

We performed a narrative literature review to identify the recommendations for the psychological management of SpA and associated IBD and to explore their level of implementation. Based on the findings, we developed a national survey to assess: (1) current level of knowledge and implementation of the recommendations; (2) attitudes towards the recommendations; and (3) barriers and facilitators to their implementation. The results of the review and survey were discussed by a multidisciplinary group of 9 expert rheumatologists and gastroenterologists, who defined implementation strategies to increase the uptake of the recommendations.The review included 4 articles, 2 of them included direct recommendations on the identification and management of psychological problems in patients with SpA and IBD. None assessed the level of implementation of the recommendations in routine clinical practice. Our survey showed a great lack of awareness and implementation of the recommendations, even though psychological issues are very relevant for health professionals. Lack of time, resources, and knowledge are considered the main barriers to adherence to the recommendations. We propose several implementation strategies related to educational activities, clinical practice, and others to increase the uptake of reported recommendations.Further research and efforts are required to achieve behaviour changes in clinical practice to improve the identification and management of psychological problems and needs in patients with SpA and IBD.",no,yes,no,other,,,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",2
2023-11-01,37805891,DIAGNOSTIC VALUE OF LABORATORY MARKERS OF SYNTROPIC LESIONS OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM ORGANS IN PATIENTS WITH SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS.,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects almost all internal organs, among which circulatory system organs (CSO) lesions are not only among the most common but also at the top of the list of causes of mortality. The tactics of treatment of patients with SLE without and in combination with CSO lesions are fundamentally different, and therefore, improving diagnostic methods will help to enhance the effectiveness of the management of this category of patients. The aim of the study - to determine the diagnostic value of laboratory markers of syntropic lesions of the circulatory system organs in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. The research included 125 patients with SLE with CSO lesions, among whom the vast majority were young women. Patients were stratified according to syntropy. Syntropic lesions were those whose frequency significantly increased with increasing severity of SLE: retinal angiopathy, capillaritis, Raynaud's syndrome, livedo reticularis, atherosclerosis, mitral valve insufficiency, mitral valve thickening, pericardial effusion, pulmonary hypertension, myocarditis, endocarditis, symptomatic arterial hypertension, and vein thrombosis. During the study, the diagnostic value of individual laboratory markers and their constellations in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in patients with SLE with syntropic lesions of CSO was determined step by step, and the one with the highest diagnostic value for the diagnosis of these lesions was chosen. The difference was considered statistically significant if p<0.050. The association coefficient and the contingent coefficient were used to determine the closeness of the relationship between the marker and the syntropic lesion. The relationship was considered confirmed if the association coefficient was ≥ 0.50 or the contingent coefficient was ≥ 0.30. We studied the diagnostic value of individual laboratory markers and their constellations in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in patients with SLE with syntropic CSO lesions. It was found that the best diagnostic value for the diagnosis of retinal angiopathy is the constellation of ↑ LDL + ↑ IA + ↑ anti-ds DNA + ↑ ANA; capillaritis - ↑ β-globulins + ↑ IA + ↑ anti-ds DNA + ↑ antiphospholipid antibodies Ig M + ↑ anti-Sm + ↓ C4; Raynaud's syndrome - a separate marker ↓ C3; livedo reticularis - ↑ ESR + ↑ small CIC + ↑ anti-ds DNA + ↑ anti-Sm; atherosclerosis - ↓ hemoglobin + ↑ LDL + ↑ ANA + ↓ C4; mitral valve insufficiency - ↑ ESR + ↑ anti-ds DNA + ↑ ANA + ↑ antiphospholipid antibodies Ig M; mitral valve stenosis - ↑ ESR+↑ LDL + ↑ small CK + ↑ ANA; pericardial effusion - erythropenia + ↑ C-RP + ↑ lupus anticoagulant; pulmonary hypertension - hypercholesterolemia + ↑ LDL + ↑ anti-ds DNA + ↑ ANA; myocarditis - an individual marker ↓ C4; endocarditis - ↑ ESR + ↑ total fibrinogen + ↑ γ-globulins + hypercholesterolemia + ↑ anti-Sm; symptomatic arterial hypertension - ↑ LDL + ↑ anti-ds DNA + ↑ ANA + ↑ anti-SSA (Ro); vein thrombosis - erythropenia + ↓ hemoglobin + ↑ LDL + ↑ ANA.

2023-11-01,37805905,CIRCULATING PEPTIDES OF THE TNF SUPERFAMILY AND TNF RECEPTOR SUPERFAMILY IN SUBJECTS WITH TYPE 1 DIABETES: RELATIONSHIPS WITH CLINICAL AND METABOLIC PARAMETERS.,"Tumor Necrosis Factor Superfamily (TNFSF) and Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily (TNFRSF) molecules play an essential role in the regulation of immune and inflammatory reactions and may be involved in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D). In this study, we aimed to assess serum levels of TNFSF and TNFRSF peptides in T1D subjects depending on their clinical and metabolic parameters. Fifty-eight adults with T1D and 19 individuals with normal glucose tolerance (control) were included in the study. Concentrations of TNF-α, TNF-β, TWEAK, APRIL, BAFF, LIGHT, sTNFR1, sTNFR2, and sCD30 were assessed by multiplex bead array assay. Time in range (TIR) and glucose variability (GV) were assessed by continuous glucose monitoring. Patients with T1D had increased levels of TNF-α and decreased levels of LIGHT compared to control (р=0.03 and p=0.02 respectively). Patients with TIR <70% when compared with those with TIR >70% demonstrated higher levels of TNF-α (р=0.008), APRIL (р=0.01) and lower levels of BAFF (<0.0001). Serum APRIL and BAFF correlated differently with GV. Overweight or obese patients had higher levels of sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 than those with normal body weight (sTNFR1: p=0.01; sTNFR2: p=0.02). Patients with diabetic retinopathy compared to those without showed increased levels of APRIL (р=0.008) and patients with declined renal function had higher concentrations of APRIL (р=0.03), BAFF (р=0.03), and sCD30 (p=0.04). In multiple regression analysis, HbA1c was associated with TNF-α, eGFR was predictor for sCD30 and APRIL, BMI was associated with APRIL and sTNFR1, and TIR was associated with BAFF. The results show the relationships between TNFSF and TNFRSF peptides, hyperglycemia, GV, obesity, and diabetic complications in T1D. Among the studied molecules, TNF-α, APRIL, BAFF, sTNFR1, and sCD30 can be considered as promising biomarkers for assessing metabolic and vascular risk in subjects with T1D.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinopathy,2

However, there is a limited investigation into the relationship between widely used cardiac biomarkers known as natriuretic peptides, including Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), N-Terminal Pro-B-Type Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP), and Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and COVID-19 infection specifically in patients with heart failure. These natriuretic peptides assess the hemodynamic stress on the heart wall and have the potential to serve as biomarkers for evaluating the severity of COVID-19 infection in heart failure patients. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the plasma concentration of BNP, NT-proBNP, and ANP in a medium-sized cross-sectional case-control study involving 360 heart failure patients, both infected and uninfected with COVID-19. The heart failure patients were categorized into subgroups based on their Ejection Fraction (EF) percentage, namely heart failure with reduced EF (HFrEF), heart failure with mid-range EF (HFmrEF), and heart failure with preserved EF (HFpEF). Our findings demonstrate a significant increase in plasma levels of BNP and NT-proBNP in all heart failure patients, as well as in each subgroup (HFrEF, HFmrEF, and HFpEF) when infected with COVID-19, compared to uninfected heart failure patients. These established cardiac biomarkers have the potential to be utilized as future indicators for assessing the severity of COVID-19 infection in heart failure patients, thereby enhancing heart failure management and reducing irreversible cardiac damage.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,natriuretic,,2

To provide a foundational description of mouse lacrimal gland cell types and their patterns of gene expression, we have analyzed single-cell transcriptomes from wild-type (Balb/c) mice and from two genetically based SjS models, MRL/lpr and NOD (nonobese diabetic).H2b, and defined the localization of multiple cell-type-specific protein and mRNA markers. This analysis has uncovered a previously undescribed cell type, Car6+ cells, which are located at the junction of the acini and the connecting ducts. More than a dozen secreted polypeptides that are likely to be components of tear fluid are expressed by acinar cells and show pronounced sex differences in expression. Additional examples of gene expression heterogeneity within a single cell type were identified, including a gradient of Claudin4 along the length of the ductal system and cell-to-cell heterogeneity in transcription factor expression within acinar and myoepithelial cells. The patterns of expression of channels, transporters, and pumps in acinar, Car6+, and ductal cells make strong predictions regarding the mechanisms of water and electrolyte secretion. In MRL/lpr and NOD.H2b lacrimal glands, distinctive changes in parenchymal gene expression and in immune cell subsets reveal widespread interferon responses, a T cell-dominated infiltrate in the MRL/lpr model, and a mixed B cell and T cell infiltrate in the NOD.H2b model.",no,yes,no,animal,biomarker,,"dry eye, Sjogren's syndrome",2

The study included 498 (198 women, 300 men) patients with CHF, in whom, in addition to iron metabolism, the quality of life and exercise tolerance (ET) were studied. 97 % of patients were enrolled during their stay in a hospital. ID was defined in consistency with the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines. Also, and additional analysis was performed according to ID criteria validated by the morphological picture of the bone marrow.Results    ID was detected in 174 (87.9 %) women and 239 (79.8 %) men (p=0.028) according to the ESC criteria, and in 154 (77.8 %) women and 217 (72.3 %) men (p=0.208) according to the criteria validated by the morphological picture of the bone marrow. Men with ID were older and had more severe CHF. They more frequently had HF functional class (FC) III and IV (63.4 % vs. 43.3 % in men without ID); higher concentrations of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and lower ET. HF FC III increased the probability of ID presence 3.4 times (p=0.02) and the probability of HF FC IV 13.7 times (p=0.003). This clinical picture was characteristic of men when either method of determining ID was used. In women, ID was not associated with more severe CHF.Conclusion    Based on the presented analysis, it is possible to characterize the male and female ID phenotypes. The male ID phenotype is associated with more severe CHF, low ET, and poor quality of life. In females of the study cohort, ID was not associated with either the severity of CHF or with ET.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinopathy,2
2023-11-01,37816853,Vertical asymmetry analysis of the macular microvasculature in epiretinal membrane patients with open-angle glaucoma.,"To identify the usefulness of vertical asymmetry analysis of the retinal microvasculature in epiretinal membrane (ERM) patients accompanied by open-angle glaucoma (OAG). Subjects were divided into three groups: normal controls (group 1), patients with ERM (group 2), and patients with both ERM and OAG (group 3). Retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) thicknesses, vessel density (VD), and the absolute vertical difference of pRNFL (vdRNFL), GC-IPL (vdGC-IPL), and VD (vdVD) were compared among groups. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the factors associated with OAG. Diagnostic accuracy based on the area under the curve (AUC) was conducted. The VD of the full area was 20.9 ± 1.2, 20.0 ± 1.9, and 18.8 ± 2.2 mm-1 (P < 0.001) for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The vdVD differed significantly between group 2 and group 3 (P < 0.001), whereas vdRNFL (P = 0.531) and vdGC-IPL (P = 0.818) did not show a significant difference. Multivariate logistic analyses showed that average pRNFL thickness (OR 0.924, P = 0.001) and vdVD (OR 5.673, P < 0.001) were significant factors associated with OAG in ERM patients. The AUC of the vdVD was 0.81 (95% CI 0.72-0.89), and the combination of average pRNFL thickness and vdVD had the highest AUC (0.87; 95% CI 0.78-0.95; P < 0.001). ERM patients with OAG had a significantly thinner pRNFL thickness, lower macular VD, and higher vdVD than those without OAG. Average pRNFL thickness and vdVD were significant factors associated with OAG in patients with ERM. Additionally, the combination of average pRNFL thickness and vdVD showed good diagnostic performance for OAG in patients with ERM.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,diagnostic,,"retinopathy, retinal disease",2
2023-11-01,37817246,N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide is associated with clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,"Limited data on the prognostic value of periprocedural changes of plasma N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).Data of plasma NT-proBNP were retrospectively collected in 357 patients before TAVR procedure and at discharge from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2021 in our single center. Patients were grouped as responders and non-responders according to the NT-proBNP ratio (postprocedural NT-proBNP at discharge/ preprocedural NT-proBNP). Responders were defined as NT-proBNP ratio < 1 and non-responders were defined as NT-proBNP ratio ≥ 1. Outcomes were defined according to the Valve Academy Research Consortium (VARC)-3 criteria.A total of 234 patients (65.5%) and 123 patients (34.5%) were grouped as the responders and the non-responders, respectively. Responders and non-responders were significantly different in both median preprocedural (2103.5 vs. 421.0 pg/ml, p < 0.001) and postprocedural (707.6 vs. 1009.0, p < 0.001) NT-proBNP levels. Patients in the non-responder group were more inclined to have comorbidities of hypertension (73.2% vs. 51.7%, p < 0.001), hyperlipidaemia (46.3% vs. 34.6%, p = 0.031), peripheral vascular disease (20.3% vs. 8.5%, p = 0.001) and pure aortic insufficiency (15.4% vs. 4.3%, p < 0.001). In the contrast, patients in the responder group had higher prevalence of maximum transvalvular velocity (4.6 vs. 4.2 m/s, p < 0.001), reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (58.0% vs. 63.0%, p < 0.001), heart failure (9.4% vs. 2.4%, p = 0.014), mitral regurgitation ≥ moderate (13.7% vs. 4.9%, p = 0.010), tricuspid regurgitation ≥ moderate (12.0% vs. 2.4%, p = 0.002), and pulmonary hypertension (32.9% vs. 13.0%, p < 0.001). Patients in the non-responder group were moderately longer than the responder group in total hospitalization length (14 vs. 12 days, p < 0.001). The non-responder group were significantly associated with cumulative all-cause mortality (p = 0.009) and cardiac mortality (p < 0.001) during the follow-up period.Periprocedural changes of NT-proBNP is clinically useful for the risk stratification of survival in patients after TAVR.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,natriuretic,,2
2023-11-01,37817823,Elastic Deformation of Optical Coherence Tomography Images of Diabetic Macular Edema for Deep-Learning Models Training: How Far to Go?,"- Objective: To explore the clinical validity of elastic deformation of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images for data augmentation in the development of deep-learning model for detection of diabetic macular edema (DME).Prospective evaluation of OCT images of DME (n = 320) subject to elastic transformation, with the deformation intensity represented by ([Formula: see text]). Three sets of images, each comprising 100 pairs of scans (100 original & 100 modified), were grouped according to the range of ([Formula: see text]), including low-, medium- and high-degree of augmentation; ([Formula: see text] = 1-6), ([Formula: see text] = 7-12), and ([Formula: see text] = 13-18), respectively. Three retina specialists evaluated all datasets in a blinded manner and designated each image as 'original' versus 'modified'. The rate of assignment of 'original' value to modified images (false-negative) was determined for each grader in each dataset.The false-negative rates ranged between 71-77% for the low-, 63-76% for the medium-, and 50-75% for the high-augmentation categories. The corresponding rates of correct identification of original images ranged between 75-85% ([Formula: see text]0.05) in the low-, 73-85% ([Formula: see text]0.05 for graders 1 & 2, p = 0.01 for grader 3) in the medium-, and 81-91% ([Formula: see text]) in the high-augmentation categories. In the subcategory ([Formula: see text] = 7-9) the false-negative rates were 93-83%, whereas the rates of correctly identifying original images ranged between 89-99% ([Formula: see text]0.05 for all graders).Deformation of low-medium intensity ([Formula: see text] = 1-9) may be applied without compromising OCT image representativeness in DME.

2023-11-01,37821911,Association of pulmonary transit time by cardiac magnetic resonance with heart failure hospitalization in a large prospective cohort with diverse cardiac conditions.,"Longer pulmonary transit time (PTT) is closely associated with hemodynamic abnormalities. However, the implications on heart failure (HF) risk have not been investigated broadly in patients with diverse cardiac conditions. In this study we examined the long-term risk of HF hospitalization associated with longer PTT in a large prospective cohort with a broad spectrum of cardiac conditions.All subjects were prospectively recruited to undergo cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). The dynamic images of first-pass perfusion were acquired to assess peak-to-peak pulmonary transit time (PTT) which was subsequently normalized to RR interval duration. The risk of HF was examined using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for baseline confounding risk factors.Among 506 consecutively consented patients undergoing clinical cardiac MR with diverse cardiac conditions, the mean age was 63 ± 14 years and 373 (73%) were male. After a mean follow up duration of 4.5 ± 3.0 years, 70 (14%) patients developed hospitalized HF and of these 6 died. A normalized PTT ≥ 8.2 was associated with a significantly increased adjusted HF hazard ratio of 3.69 (95% CI 2.02, 6.73). The HF hazard ratio was 1.26 (95% CI 1.18, 1.33) for each 1 unit increase in PTT which was higher among those preserved (1.70, 95% CI 1.20, 2.41) compared to those with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (< 50%) (1.18, 95% CI 1.09, 1.27). PTT remained a significant risk factor of hospitalized HF after additional adjustment for N-terminal pro-hormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) or left ventricular global longitudinal strain with additionally demonstrated incremental model improvement through likelihood ratio testing.Our findings support the role of PTT in assessing HF risk among patients with broad spectrum of cardiac conditions with reduced as well as preserved ejection fraction. Longer PTT duration is an incremental risk factor for HF when baseline global longitudinal strain and NT-proBNP are taken into consideration.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,natriuretic,,2
2023-11-01,37823571,Correlation of leucocyte and platelet indices in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with microvascular complications at a tertiary care hospital in south India - A prospective cross-sectional study.,"Objective. The present study was directed to assess the correlation between leukocyte and platelet indices and microvascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods. A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted between January 2020 and May 2021 at a tertiary healthcare center. Sixty T2DM patients, who fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria, were included into the study and divided into 2 groups: T2DM patients with microvascular complications and T2DM patients without vascular complications. Clinical history was taken and examinations (routine complete blood count) were done to obtain platelet indices, neutrophillymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR) were obtained and tabulated. A correlation was statistically analyzed from the obtained data, p value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Results. From the patients with microvascular complications, 18 cases suffered from retinopathy and nephropathy. Majority of the participants suffered from moderate non-proliferative retinopathy. The creatine median and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) were significantly higher in T2DM patients with microvascular complications (p<0.0001 and p<0.0054, respectively) compared to T2DM patients without vascular complications. No significant correlation was found between platelet indices, NLR, PLR with regard to fasting blood sugar, post prandial blood sugar, HbA1C in T2DM patients. Conclusions. Since no significant correlation was found between the different platelet indices and microvascular complications, it is evident that these markers cannot be used as the predictors of microvascular complications in T2DM patients.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinopathy,2
2023-11-01,37824135,Presumed Müller Cell Activation in Multiple Evanescent White Dot Syndrome.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the foveal changes occurring in multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (MEWDS) using multimodal imaging techniques with a specific focus on hyper-reflective dots (HRDs).This was a retro-prospective observational study including 35 eyes with active MEWDS. Structural and en face optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed, with follow-up visits at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 2 months from baseline. HRD percentage area (HRD % area) was calculated in a 600 µm fovea centered circle on en face OCT, after background subtraction and image binarization. HRD % area was compared with 23 fellow control eyes. Longitudinal changes in the HRD % areas were assessed using repeated-measure statistics.HRDs were observed as scattered hyper-reflective spots on the vitreoretinal interface on en face OCT images, colocalizing with HRDs or vertical hyper-reflective lines on structural OCT images. The baseline evaluation showed a significantly higher HRD % area in MEWDS eyes compared to fellow eyes (0.10 ± 0.03 vs. 0.08 ± 0.04, P = 0.01). The HRD % area correlated positively with LogMAR visual acuity and inversely with the duration of symptoms. Longitudinal analysis revealed a significant reduction in the HRD % area over time. There was no significant interaction between the rate of HRD disappearance and clinical or demographic factors at baseline.As HRD potentially represents the end-feet projections of activated Müller cells on the retinal surface, this study supports the involvement of Müller cells in the pathogenesis of the disease. The findings highlight the potential of en face OCT imaging for monitoring the progression of MEWDS.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinal disease,2
2023-11-01,37828486,Causal effects of inflammatory bowel diseases on the risk of kidney stone disease: a two-sample bidirectional mendelian randomization.,"Existing epidemiological observational studies have suggested interesting but inconsistent clinical correlations between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), and kidney stone disease (KSD). Herein, we implemented a two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the causal relationship between IBD and KSD.Data on IBD and KSD were obtained from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) summary statistics and the FinnGen consortium, respectively. Strict selection steps were used to screen for eligible instrumental SNPs. We applied inverse variance weighting (IVW) with the fix-effects model as the major method. Several sensitivity analyses were used to evaluate pleiotropy and heterogeneity. Causal relationships between IBD and KSD were explored in two opposite directions. Furthermore, we carried out multivariable MR (MVMR) to obtain the direct causal effects of IBD on KSD.Our results demonstrated that CD could increase the risk of KSD (IVW: OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.03-1.10, p < 0.001). Similar results were found in the validation group (IVW: OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.01-1.08, p = 0.013) and in the MVMR analysis. Meanwhile, no evidence of a causal association between UC and KSD was identified. The reverse MR analysis detected no causal association.This MR study verified that CD plays a critical role in developing kidney stones and that the effect of UC on KSD needs to be further explored.",no,yes,no,other,biomarker,,"crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis",2
2023-11-01,37831445,Association of Subretinal Fluid Duration and Baseline Chorioretinal Structure With Optical Coherence Tomography in Central Serous Chorioretinopathy.,"This study investigated the association between subretinal fluid (SRF) duration and baseline chorioretinal structure in patients with naïve (first-episode and untreated) central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC).We divided 59 patients into non-prolonged (<3 months) and prolonged (>3 months) groups based on SRF fluid persistence from the initial visit. The follow-up period varied as the shorter duration was chosen between SRF disappearance time and 3 months from the initial visit. We measured the central retinal thickness (CRT), central choroidal thickness (CCT), SRF height (SRFH), and outer nuclear layer thickness (ONL) using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) at the initial visit and recorded SRF duration. We compared these parameters between the groups, conducted multivariate analysis for SRF duration of more than 3 months, and investigated the correlation among CCT and CRT, SRFH, or ONL, and among SRF duration and CRT, CCT, SRFH, or ONL.CCT was significantly thicker in the prolonged than in the non-prolonged group at the initial visit (P = 0.044) and significantly correlated with CRT and SRFH (P = 0.007, r = 0.35 and P = 0.002, r = 0.39). SRF duration significantly correlated with CRT and SRFH (P = 0.009, r = 0.40 and P = 0.003, r = 0.41). The optimal model for SRF duration more than 3 months included age (P = 0.054) and CCT (P = 0.008).Thicker baseline CCT can lead to a longer SRF duration in naïve CSC.This association aids in early detection of cases at a higher risk of prolonged SRF.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinal disease,2
2023-11-01,37833928,Involvement of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) in Autoimmune Diseases.,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a complex reversible biological process characterized by the loss of epithelial features and the acquisition of mesenchymal features. EMT was initially described in developmental processes and was further associated with pathological conditions including metastatic cascade arising in neoplastic progression and organ fibrosis. Fibrosis is delineated by an excessive number of myofibroblasts, resulting in exuberant production of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, thereby compromising organ function and ultimately leading to its failure. It is now well acknowledged that a significant number of myofibroblasts result from the conversion of epithelial cells via EMT. Over the past two decades, evidence has accrued linking fibrosis to many chronic autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including systemic sclerosis (SSc), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren's syndrome (SS), and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In addition, chronic inflammatory states observed in most autoimmune and inflammatory diseases can act as a potent trigger of EMT, leading to the development of a pathological fibrotic state. In the present review, we aim to describe the current state of knowledge regarding the contribution of EMT to the pathophysiological processes of various rheumatic conditions.",no,yes,yes,other,,,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",2

Multiple consecutive en face OCTA images were acquired. Bias field correction, spatial alignment, and normalization of intensities across the images were performed followed by pixelwise computation of standard deviation divided by the mean to generate a CoV map. Region of interest-based CoV values, derived from this map, for arterioles, venules, and the microvasculature were compared between regions with macular ischemia and control areas of the same eye. Control areas were regions of the same macula that were not affected by the BRVO and had normal retinal vascular structure as seen on multimodal imaging and normal retinal vascular density measurements as quantified using OCTA.CoV increased by a mean value of 17.6% within the microvasculature of ischemic regions compared to the control microvasculature (P < 0.0001). CoV measurements of microvasculature were consistently greater in the ischemic area of all 13 eyes compared to control. There were no differences in CoV measurements between ischemic and control areas for arterioles (P = 0.13) and venules (P = 1.0).Greater variability in microvasculature perfusion occurs at sites of macular ischemia due to BRVO. We report a novel way for quantifying macular perfusion variability using OCTA.

Dry eye-related examinations and retinal thickness measurement were conducted. The odds ratio (OR) was calculated with logistic regression analyses of ocular data in relation to the presence of visual symptoms.A total of 6078 patients (3920 women, mean age 49.0 ± 20.4 years) were analyzed. The prevalence of each symptom was 31.8% for eye strain, 22.5% for blurred vision and 16.0% for photophobia. A significant risk factor for eye strain was short tear break-up time (TBUT) (OR 1.88), superficial punctate keratitis (SPK) (OR 1.44), and thickness of ganglion cell complex (GCC) (OR 1.30). Risk factors for blurred vision were short TBUT (OR 1.85), SPK (OR 1.24) and GCC (OR 0.59). Risk factors for photophobia were short TBUT (OR 1.77) and SPK (OR 1.32). Schirmer test value, peripapillary nerve fiber layer thickness and full macular thickness were not associated with the tested symptoms.The current study successfully identified female gender, short TBUT, and SPK as significant risk factors for eye strain, blurred vision, and photophobia with considerable ORs.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,"dry eye, retinal disease",2
2023-11-01,37863656,Role of ciliopathy protein TMEM107 in eye development: insights from a mouse model and retinal organoid.,"Primary cilia are cellular surface projections enriched in receptors and signaling molecules, acting as signaling hubs that respond to stimuli. Malfunctions in primary cilia have been linked to human diseases, including retinopathies and ocular defects. Here, we focus on TMEM107, a protein localized to the transition zone of primary cilia. TMEM107 mutations were found in patients with Joubert and Meckel-Gruber syndromes. A mouse model lacking Tmem107 exhibited eye defects such as anophthalmia and microphthalmia, affecting retina differentiation. Tmem107 expression during prenatal mouse development correlated with phenotype occurrence, with enhanced expression in differentiating retina and optic stalk. TMEM107 deficiency in retinal organoids resulted in the loss of primary cilia, down-regulation of retina-specific genes, and cyst formation. Knocking out TMEM107 in human ARPE-19 cells prevented primary cilia formation and impaired response to Smoothened agonist treatment because of ectopic activation of the SHH pathway. Our data suggest TMEM107 plays a crucial role in early vertebrate eye development and ciliogenesis in the differentiating retina.",no,yes,no,animal,biomarker,,retinopathy,2
2023-11-01,37863966,Disease-specific loss of microbial cross-feeding interactions in the human gut.,"Many gut microorganisms critical to human health rely on nutrients produced by each other for survival; however, these cross-feeding interactions are still challenging to quantify and remain poorly characterized. Here, we introduce a Metabolite Exchange Score (MES) to quantify those interactions. Using metabolic models of prokaryotic metagenome-assembled genomes from over 1600 individuals, MES allows us to identify and rank metabolic interactions that are significantly affected by a loss of cross-feeding partners in 10 out of 11 diseases. When applied to a Crohn's disease case-control study, our approach identifies a lack of species with the ability to consume hydrogen sulfide as the main distinguishing microbiome feature of disease. We propose that our conceptual framework will help prioritize in-depth analyses, experiments and clinical targets, and that targeting the restoration of microbial cross-feeding interactions is a promising mechanism-informed strategy to reconstruct a healthy gut ecosystem.",no,yes,no,other,biomarker,,crohn's disease,2

All eyes were classified as having posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) or not having PVD. The sensitivity of Optos imaging for the visibility of vitreous floaters was evaluated. The associated factors with the visibility of vitreous floaters on Optos images were analyzed in univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses.The mean age of all patients was 56.19 ± 13.89 years old, and 66.67% of patients were female. The vitreous floaters were visible on the ultrasound B scan in all eyes, but only in 47.62% of Optos images (55.29% in eyes with PVD and 15% in eyes without PVD). In the multiple binary logistic regression analysis, age (OR = 1.094, 95%CI = 1.063-1.125, P < 0.001), spherical equivalent (OR = 0.869, 95%CI = 0.791-0.955, P = 0.004) and the distance of the floaters from the retina (OR = 1.191, 95%CI = 1.059-1.339, P = 0.003) were significantly correlated with the visibility of vitreous floaters on Optos images. On Optos images, 25.71% of VDM eyes presented additional retinal abnormalities.Optos imaging has a low sensitivity for vitreous floaters, particularly in eyes without PVD.

We used Colaizzi content analysis to synthesize the themes.The two main themes in this study were inappropriate coping mechanisms and physical and psychological stress. The primary initiators of physical and psychological stress in adolescents with Crohn's disease were weak disease perception, symptom distress, negative emotions, lack of support, and multiple stressors. The decrease in self-management and self-control induced by the initiators led to changes in cognition, emotions, and attitudes, which subsequently led to poor coping behavior.Adolescents with Crohn's disease can better combat the condition by implementing appropriate coping strategies. Their mental health should be given attention, and a multidisciplinary team should be assembled to provide them with supportive care.",no,yes,no,other,,,crohn's disease,2

The adipocytokines are closely associated with the occurrence and development of diabetes and its related complications. Literature confirms that the level of adiponectin in patients with DR is significantly higher; however, the relationship between other adipocytokines (leptin, chemerin, apelin, and omentin-1) and DR remains unclear.This study aimed to systematically evaluate the association between adipocytokines (leptin, chemerin, apelin, and omentin-1) and DR.The PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, EBSCO and Willy databases were used to search for potential studies with keywords such as ""diabetic retinopathy"" or ""DR"" in combination with the terms ""leptin,"" ""chemerin"", ""apelin"" or ""omentin-1"" in the search titles or abstracts. Standardized mean differences (SMD) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined as the results of the meta-analysis.After screening, 18 articles were included in the meta-analysis including 750 DR cases and 993 controls. Leptin and chemerin levels in patients with DR were significantly higher than those in the control group (SMD: 0.68, 95% CI [0.1, 1.26]; SMD: 0.79, 95% CI [0.35, 1.23]). The omentin-1 levels in patients with DR were significantly lower than those in the controls (SMD: -0.85, 95% CI [-1.08, -0.62]).To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to evaluate the leptin, chemerin, apelin, and omentin-1 levels in patients with DR.

Pre-term infants were grouped as those without ROP (no ROP; n = 14) and with ROP (ROP; n = 15). Sterile Schirmer's strips were used to collect the tear fluid from pre-term infants. Inflammatory factors such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, MCP1 (Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein 1; CCL2), RANTES (Regulated on Activation, Normal T Cell Expressed and Secreted; CCL5), and soluble L-selectin (sL-selectin) were measured by cytometric bead array using a flow cytometer.Birth weight (BW) and gestation age (GA) were significantly (P < 0.05) lower in pre-term infants with ROP compared with those without ROP. Higher levels of RANTES (P < 0.05) and IL-8 (P = 0.09) were observed in the tear fluid of pre-term infants with ROP compared with those without ROP. Lower levels of tear fluid IL-6 (P = 0.14) and sL-selectin (P = 0.18) were measured in pre-term infants with ROP compared with those without ROP. IL-8 and RANTES were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the tear fluid of pre-term infants with stage 3 ROP compared with those without ROP. Tear fluid RANTES level was observed to be inversely associated with GA and BW of pre-term infants with ROP and not in those without ROP. Furthermore, the area under the curve and odds ratio analysis demonstrated the relevance of RANTES/BW (AUC = 0.798; OR-7.2) and RANTES/MCP1 (AUC = 0.824; OR-6.8) ratios in ROP.Distinct changes were observed in the levels of tear inflammatory factors in ROP infants. The status of RANTES in ROP suggests its possible role in pathobiology and warrants further mechanistic studies to harness it in ROP screening and management.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinopathy,2
2023-11-01,37870010,Role of fetal hemoglobin in the development and progression of retinopathy of prematurity in preterm infants.,"The objective of this study was to find the association between fetal hemoglobin (HbF) concentration and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in preterm infants.In this observational, prospective, longitudinal study, a total of 410 preterm infants with <36 gestational weeks and <2.5 kg birth weight, who were attending ROP clinic in a tertiary care hospital of central India for 1 year duration were included. Dilated fundus examination was done as per ROP screening guidelines, and ROP was staged as per international classification for retinopathy of prematurity (ICROP) classification, 2021. HbF (%) was measured with high-performance liquid chromatography, and data was analyzed statistically. The relationship between HbF (%) and ROP was evaluated. Those infants who had ROP were further divided into treatment-requiring and non-treatment-requiring groups and HbF was compared in these groups at the first visit and after 1-month follow-up period. The outcome of ROP was studied with HbF levels.A total of 410 preterm infants were included, out of which 110 infants had ROP (26.8%). Infants with ROP had significantly lower percentage of HbF with gestational age groups and birth weight groups, compared to infants without ROP. Higher percentage of HbF was associated with a lower prevalence of ROP. Higher concentration of HbF was found in the ROP infants who regressed spontaneously without treatment and less concentration was found in those who progressed to a severe disease and those who required treatment. The predictive ability of HbF (%) was 0.976 for ROP.Low fraction of HbF was found to be significantly associated with the development and progression of ROP.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinopathy,2

Ultrawide field retinal imaging and SD-OOCT were independently evaluated for diabetic macular edema (DME) and nondiabetic macular abnormality. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated with SD-OCT as the gold standard.Four hundred twenty-two eyes from 211 diabetic patients were evaluated. Diabetic macular edema severity by UWFI was as follows: no DME 93.4%, noncenter involved DME (nonciDME) 5.1%, ciDME 0.7%, ungradable DME 0.7%. SD-OCT was ungradable in 0.5%. Macular abnormality was identified in 34 (8.1%) eyes by UWFI and in 44 (10.4%) eyes by SD-OCT. Diabetic macular edema represented only 38.6% of referable macular abnormality identified by SD-OCT imaging. Sensitivity/specificity of UWFI compared with SD-OCT was 59%/96% for DME and 33%/99% for ciDME. Sensitivity/specificity of UWFI compared with SDOCT was 3%/98% for epiretinal membrane.Addition of SD-OCT increased the identification of macular abnormality by 29.4%. More than 58.3% of the eyes believed to have any DME on UWF imaging alone were false-positives by SD-OCT. The integration of SD-OCT with UWFI markedly increased detection and reduced false-positive assessments of DME and macular abnormality in a teleophthalmology program.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,diagnostic,,retinopathy,2

A complete eye examination revealed that he had a central retinal artery occlusion. Systemic workup revealed that he had a mitral valve vegetation and blood cultures grew Bartonella henselae. His kidney biopsy showed membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, which is often seen with septic emboli. Furthermore, the patient lacked any ocular inflammatory signs. This constellation of findings was diagnostic for a thromboembolic etiology causing his central retinal artery occlusion. At follow-up, the optical coherence tomography demonstrated inner retinal hyperreflectivity and the fluorescein angiogram showed segmented flow and no neovascularization. On follow-up, the patient had a stable examination with light perception vision and completed antibiotic therapy for bartonella endocarditis.The detection of a fatal systemic illness was made promptly with a thorough ocular examination.

2023-11-01,37903307,TWO CASES OF CRB1-RELATED RETINAL DYSTROPHY ASSOCIATED WITH RETINAL MASSES.,"Mutations in CRB1 are associated with variable severity in expression leading to apparent phenotypic diversity. We present two retinal findings.We present two unrelated children with CRB1-related retinal dystrophy with a solitary mass visualized on fundoscopy. Both underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination including visual acuity assessment, optical coherence tomography, intravenous fluorescein angiography, and fundus autofluorescence.In one child, a gliotic mass was observed on the superior temporal vessel away from disk. On optical coherence tomography, the mass appeared to be located in the superficial retina and contained discrete internal moth-eaten optically empty spaces as previously reported in the astrocytic hamartomas of tuberous sclerosis. Fundus autofluorescence showed speckled hyperautofluorescence of the lesion. In the other child, there was a calcified mass within the nerve fiber layer just temporal to the optic nerve. On optical coherence tomography, this mass appeared irregular in shape, encapsulated, and had a heterogeneous disorganized interior with hyperreflective areas.In this report, we detail two presentations of CRB1-related retinal dystrophy: retinal astrocytic hamartoma and another form of superficial retinal hamartoma. We believe this may represent a manifestation of CRB1 mutations. Recognition of this finding may prevent unnecessary evaluation for tumor cause in patients with CRB1-related retinal dystrophy.",no,yes,no,other,diagnostic,,retinal disease,2

On ocular examination of both eyes, slit-lamp biomicroscopy and ophthalmoscopy revealed 0.5+ anterior chamber cell, 1+ vitreous cell, and no vitreous haze. Also noted were areas of venous perivascular sheathing and multiple (3-5) inferior snowballs. Fluorescein angiography showed optic disk hyperfluorescence, retinal phlebitis, and hyperfluorescence with late leakage in the periphery (Figure 1). Indocyanine green angiography showed small hypofluorescent spots. Also noted on the ICGA images were multiple, sharp, linear hyperfluorescent areas signifying areas of choroidal vasculitis (Figure 2). The patient was referred to rheumatology for the initiation of immunomodulatory therapy.To the best of our knowledge, this ICGA pattern of multiple, sharp, linear hyperfluorescent areas has not been previously described in patients with sarcoidosis.

2023-11-01,37904419,"Identification of immune-related hub genes contributing to the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and remission of ulcerative colitis by integrated bioinformatic analyses.","The inflammatory disease ulcerative colitis (UC) is multifaceted, immune-mediated, chronic, and relapsing, which is considered to be mainly driven by dysregulated mucosal immune response. The remission of the inflammatory response is a marker of mucosal healing, relating to the low risk of hospitalizations, colorectal cancer, and colectomy. In spite of this, it is still unclear what the key immunological mechanism is which contributes to UC. Here, we explored the immune mechanism and related key genes underlying the state of inflammation in UC. Co-expression networks were constructed based on the expression profiles of immune-related genes in GSE179285. Using Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis and Protein-protein interactions analysis, common hub genes were identified in the module of interest. Then, screening of real hub genes, significantly differentially expressing in inflamed UC, was carried out by Differential Expression Genes Analysis of GSE75214, GSE53306, and GSE6731datasets and immunohistochemistry of clinical samples. The diagnosis Capacity of the hub gene was identified by ""glm"" function in R. The potential key immune-related mechanisms were investigated using functional enrichment analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Bioinformatics tools were used to predict potential upstream transcription factors (TF), including the UCSC genome browser, correlation analyses, and JASPAR browser. The analysis revealed the blue module, consisting of 227 immune-related genes, showed the highest correlation with inflamed UC. And then, forty-three common candidates were distinguished. S100A9 was identified within the key module as a real hub gene with good diagnostic performance. The immune genes in the blue module were markedly enriched in the Cytokine-Cytokine receptor interaction. S100A9 most likely gets involved NOD-like receptor (NLR) signaling pathway. SPI1 showed the strongest likelihood to be the regulator. S100A9 was identified as the real immune-related hub gene for inflamed UC. Both diagnosis and remission may be aided by its high expression in the inflamed UC.",no,yes,no,other,"diagnostic, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,2
2023-11-02,35385436,RETINAL HYPOPERFUSION DETECTED BY WIDE-FIELD OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHIC ANGIOGRAPHY IN A CASE OF RETINAL RACEMOSE HEMANGIOMA.,"Retinal racemose hemangioma is a rare, unilateral, nonhereditary, arteriovenous malformation characterized by the appearance of dilated and tortuous retinal vessels. Retinal racemose hemangioma can develop complications associated with retinal ischemia, such as vitreous hemorrhage, retinal vein occlusion, and neovascular glaucoma. Here, a case of retinal racemose hemangioma with retinal hypoperfusion detected by wide-field swept-source optical coherence tomographic angiography was reported, which was not unambiguously illustrated by fluorescein angiography.Case report.A 57-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for the evaluation of severe retinal vascular tortuosity, dilation, and retinal hemorrhages in the left eye. Fundus examination revealed arteriovenous communications temporal to the fovea and multiple microaneurysms surrounded by retinal hemorrhages at the midperipheral temporal fundus. In fluorescein angiography, multiple hyperfluorescent lesions with leakage corresponding to microaneurysms were observed in the temporal and lower midperipheral areas; however, nonperfused areas were apparently absent. By contrast, wide-field optical coherence tomographic angiography clearly showed low-density retinal capillaries in the superotemporal quadrant in comparison with those in the inferotemporal quadrant.Wide-field optical coherence tomographic angiography detected sparse retinal capillaries, which were not well illustrated by fluorescein angiography, in a patient with retinal racemose hemangioma. This indicates the presence of low-grade retinal hypoperfusion caused by altered retinal hemodynamics, potentially leading to ischemia-related retinal disorders during a prolonged course, in patients with clinically quiescent retinal racemose hemangioma.",no,yes,no,other,diagnostic,,retinal disease,2

The aims of this study were to explore the serological response associated with IBD, and immunosuppressive medications including serum concentrations of biologics and thiopurine metabolites.This prospective, observational study included adult patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), and healthy controls. Antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, and serum concentrations of ongoing biologic and immunomodulatory medications were assessed prior to, and 2-5 weeks after the second vaccine dose. Serologic response was defined as anti-Spike antibodies ≥70 AU/ml.In 958 IBD patients (380 UC, 578 CD) and 323 healthy controls, the median (Q1; Q3) anti-Spike antibody level (AU/ml) was lower in patients (618 (192; 4370)) compared to controls (3355 (896; 7849)) (p < 0.001). The antibody levels were lower in CD (439 (174; 3304)) compared to UC (1088 (251; 5975)) (p < 0.001). No associations were demonstrated between antibody levels and serum drug concentrations for TNF inhibitor (TNFi), vedolizumab and ustekinumab. Patients receiving TNFi + thiopurines with a subtherapeutic 6-thioguanine nucleotide (6-TGN) level had higher response rate (93%) compared to patients with 6-TGN within the therapeutic range (53%) (p = 0.003). A diagnosis of UC, mRNA-1273 vaccine, and other treatments than TNFi + thiopurines were associated with humoral response.Patients with CD had an attenuated humoral response to SARS-COV-2 vaccination as compared to patients with UC.

Recently, sonographic activity scores, including the International Bowel Ultrasound Segmental Activity Score (IBUS-SAS) and Simple Ultrasound Activity Score for CD (SUS-CD), were developed. This study aimed to assess their clinical application value.This retrospective study enrolled patients with CD from March 2021 to June 2022. The diagnostic performance of the ultrasound scores was evaluated using the simplified endoscopic score for CD (SES-CD). Correlations of ultrasound scores with SES-CD, CD activity index (CDAI), and inflammatory biomarkers were assessed. Inter-rater reliability was compared.In total, 140 patients were included. The IBUS-SAS for evaluating disease activity had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.895, sensitivity of 85.4%, and specificity of 82.4% for the cut-off value of 48.7. The SUS-CD revealed an AUC of 0.835, sensitivity of 92.7%, and specificity of 64.7% for the cut-off value of 2.5. The IBUS-SAS and SUS-CD were positively correlated with SES-CD (r = 0.511 and 0.534, respectively). The scores correlated significantly with the CDAI and inflammatory biomarkers (all p < 0.01). The IBUS-SAS was more strongly correlated with CDAI (r = 0.666 vs 0.486) and C-reactive protein (r = 0.645 vs 0.434) than the SUS-CD. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of the IBUS-SAS and SUS-CD between the two sonologists was excellent (ICC = 0.96 and 0.78, respectively).Both the IBUS-SAS and SUS-CD can evaluate disease activity in CD and exhibited a significant correlation with activity indices and inflammatory biomarkers.ChiCTR2200055221.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"diagnostic, biomarker",,crohn's disease,2
2023-11-02,36849659,Roles of non-coding RNAs in eye development and diseases.,"The prevalence of ocular disorders is dramatically increasing worldwide, especially those that cause visual impairment and permanent loss of vision, including cataract, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy. Extensive evidence has shown that ncRNAs are key regulators in various biogenesis and biological functions, controlling gene expression related to histogenesis and cell differentiation in ocular tissues. Aberrant expression and function of ncRNA can lead to dysfunction of visual system and mediate progression of eye disorders. Here, we mainly offer an overview of the role of precise modulation of ncRNAs in eye development and function in patients with eye diseases.

We aim to determine the performance of IUS in the assessment of disease activity in IBD.This is a prospective cross-sectional study of IUS performed on IBD patients in a tertiary centre. IUS parameters including intestinal wall thickness, loss of wall stratification, mesenteric fibrofatty proliferation, and increased vascularity were compared with endoscopic and clinical activity indices.Among the 51 patients, 58.8% were male, with a mean age of 41 years. Fifty-seven percent had underlying ulcerative colitis with mean disease duration of 8.4 years. Against ileocolonoscopy, IUS had a sensitivity of 67% (95% confidence interval (CI): 41-86) for detecting endoscopically active disease. It had high specificity of 97% (95% CI: 82-99) with positive and negative predictive values of 92% and 84%, respectively. Against clinical activity index, IUS had a sensitivity of 70% (95% CI: 35-92) and specificity of 85% (95% CI: 70-94) for detecting moderate to severe disease. Among individual IUS parameters, presence of bowel wall thickening (>3 mm) had the highest sensitivity (72%) for detecting endoscopically active disease. For per-bowel segment analysis, IUS (bowel wall thickening) was able to achieve 100% sensitivity and 95% specificity when examining the transverse colon.IUS has moderate sensitivity with excellent specificity in detecting active disease in IBD. IUS is most sensitive in detecting a disease at transverse colon.

2023-11-02,36944385,"Forecasting Risk of Future Rapid Glaucoma Worsening Using Early Visual Field, OCT, and Clinical Data.","To assess whether we can forecast future rapid visual field (VF) worsening using deep learning models (DLMs) trained on early VF, OCT, and clinical data.A retrospective cohort study.In total, 4536 eyes from 2962 patients. Overall, 263 (5.80%) eyes underwent rapid VF worsening (mean deviation slope less than -1 dB/year across all VFs).We included eyes that met the following criteria: (1) followed for glaucoma or suspect status; (2) had at least 5 longitudinal reliable VFs (VF1, VF2, VF3, VF4, and VF5); and (3) had 1 reliable baseline OCT scan (OCT1) and 1 set of baseline clinical measurements (clinical1) at the time of VF1. We designed a DLM to forecast future rapid VF worsening. The input consisted of spatially oriented total deviation values from VF1 (including or not including VF2 and VF3 in some models) and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness values from the baseline OCT. We passed this VF/OCT stack into a vision transformer feature extractor, the output of which was concatenated with baseline clinical data before putting it through a linear classifier to predict the eye's risk of rapid VF worsening across the 5 VFs. We compared the performance of models with differing inputs by computing area under the curve (AUC) in the test set. Specifically, we trained models with the following inputs: (1) model V: VF1; (2) VC: VF1+ Clinical1; (3) VO: VF1+ OCT1; (4) VOC: VF1+ Clinical1+ OCT1; (5) V2: VF1 + VF2; (6) V2OC: VF1 + VF2 + Clinical1 + OCT1; (7) V3: VF1 + VF2 + VF3; and (8) V3OC: VF1 + VF2 + VF3 + Clinical1 + OCT1.The AUC of DLMs when forecasting rapidly worsening eyes.Model V3OC best forecasted rapid worsening with an AUC (95% confidence interval [CI]) of 0.87 (0.77-0.97). Remaining models in descending order of performance and their respective AUC (95% CI) were as follows: (1) model V3 (0.84 [0.74-0.95]), (2) model V2OC (0.81 [0.70-0.92]), (3) model V2 (0.81 [0.70-0.82]), (4) model VOC (0.77 [0.65-0.88]), (5) model VO (0.75 [0.64-0.88]), (6) model VC (0.75 [0.63-0.87]), and (7) model V (0.74 [0.62-0.86]).Deep learning models can forecast future rapid glaucoma worsening with modest to high performance when trained using data from early in the disease course.

2023-11-02,36970968,Early fecal calprotectin levels at week 8 may guide therapeutic decisions on Ustekinumab therapy in patients with Crohn's disease.,"Response evaluation after induction therapy with ustekinumab (UST) in Crohn's disease (CD) is important for decisions on maintenance therapy. We aimed to assess the potential of fecal calprotectin (FC) levels to predict endoscopic response at week 16.CD patients with FC >100 µg/g and endoscopic active disease (SES-CD> 2, Rutgeerts' score ≥ i2) at initiation of UST therapy were enrolled. FC was determined at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8 and 16 and patients underwent a colonoscopy at week 16. The primary outcome was an endoscopic response at week 16 (SES-CD score ≥50% decrease or a decrease of ≥1 points in Rutgeerts' score). The optimal cut-off levels of FC and change in FC to predict endoscopic response were determined using ROC statistics.59 CD patients were included. Endoscopic response was observed in 21/59 (36%) patients. The diagnostic accuracy for FC levels at week 8 to predict endoscopic response at week 16 showed a predictive value of 0.71. A decrease in FC levels ≥500 µg/g between baseline at week 8 indicates endoscopic response (PPV = 89%), whereas absence of any decrease indicates endoscopic non-response after induction (NPV = 81%).Continuation of UST therapy without endoscopic response evaluation may be considered in patients with a decrease in FC levels of ≥500 µg/g at week 8. The decision on continuation of UST therapy or therapy optimization needs reconsideration in patients without a decrease of FC level. In all other patients, endoscopic response evaluation of induction therapy remains essential for therapeutic decisions.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,diagnostic,,crohn's disease,2
2023-11-02,37023894,Fibrosis in neovascular age-related macular degeneration: A review of definitions based on clinical imaging.,"Despite the success of antiangiogenic therapy in controlling exudation in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), the involvement of the outer retina in fibrosis results in gradual vision loss over time. The development of drugs that prevent or ameliorate fibrosis in nAMD requires that it is accurately detected and quantified with reliable endpoints and identification of robust biomarkers. Achievement of such an aim is currently challenging due to the lack of a consensus definition of fibrosis in nAMD. As a first step towards the establishment of a clear definition of fibrosis, we provide an extensive overview of the imaging modalities and criteria used to characterize fibrosis in nAMD. We observed variety in the selection of individual and combinations of imaging modalities, and criteria for detection. We also observed heterogeneity in classification systems and severity scales for fibrosis. The most commonly used imaging modalities were color fundus photography, fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography (OCT). A multimodal approach was frequently utilized. Our review suggests that OCT offers a more detailed, objective and sensitive characterization than color fundus photography/fluorescein angiography. Thus, we recommend it as a primary modality for fibrosis evaluation. This review provides a basis for future discussions to reach a consensus definition using standardized terms based on a detailed characterization of fibrosis, its presence and evolution, and taking into consideration impact on visual function. Achieving this goal is of paramount importance for the development of antifibrotic therapies.",no,yes,no,other,biomarker,,retinal disease,2

Our study aimed to analyze the predictors of colectomy within 3 years of ASUC in an Indian cohort and derive a simple predictive score.A prospective observational study was conducted in a tertiary health care center in South India over a period of 5 years. All patients admitted with ASUC were followed up for a period of 24 months after the index admission, to look for progression to colectomy.A total of 81 (47 male) patients were included in the derivation cohort. Fifteen (18.5%) patients required colectomy during a follow-up period of 24 months. On regression analysis, C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum albumin were independent predictors of 24-month colectomy. The CRAB (CRP + AlBumin) score was obtained by multiplying coefficient of beta to albumin and CRP (CRAB score = CRP x 0.2 - Albumin x 0.26). The CRAB score demonstrated an AUROC of 0.923 and a score of >0.4 with a sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 92% for the prediction of 2-year colectomy following ASUC. The score was validated in a validation cohort of 31 patients, and at >0.4, the score had a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 96% in predicting colectomy.CRAB score is a simple prognostic score that can predict 2-year colectomy in ASUC patients with high sensitivity and specificity.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,diagnostic,,ulcerative colitis,2

Current evidences supported that bile acids (BAs) alteration might be promising biomarkers in the field of IBD. We aimed to analyze the alterations of BAs as the disease progresses and explore their predictive value for indolent course of IBD.The indolent course of IBD was defined as a disease course without need for strict interventions throughout the entire follow-up. A targeted metabolomics method was used to detect the concentration of 27 BAs from serum sample in treatment-naive patients with IBD (Crohn's disease [CD], n = 27; ulcerative colitis [UC], n = 50). Patients with CD and UC were individually divided into two groups for further study according to the median time of indolent course. The overall BAs profile and the clinical value of BAs in predicting indolent course of IBD were identified between different groups.For CD, the levels of deoxycholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, glycolithocholic acid-3-sulfate disodium salt and iso-lithocholic acid were significantly increased in patients with indolent course > 18 M (p < 0.05). These five BAs owned 83.5% accuracy for predicting indolent course over 18 months in CD. For UC, the concentration of deoxycholic acid and glycodeoxycholic acid were significantly higher, while dehydrocholic acid were lower in patients with indolent course > 48 M (p < 0.05). These three BAs predicted indolent course over 48 months of 69.8% accuracy in UC.The specific BAs alterations might be potential biomarkers in predicting disease course of IBD patients.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",2

This consensus report reviews features of HF in PWD from the perspectives of 1) epidemiology, 2) classification of stages, 3) pathophysiology, 4) biomarkers for diagnosing, 5) biomarker assays, 6) diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers, 7) benefits of biomarker screening, 8) consensus recommendations for biomarker screening, 9) stratification of Stage B HF, 10) echocardiographic screening, 11) management of Stage A and Stage B HF, and 12) future directions. The Diabetes Technology Society panel recommends 1) biomarker screening with one of two circulating natriuretic peptides (B-type natriuretic peptide or N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide), 2) beginning screening five years following diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and at the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (T2D), 3) beginning routine screening no earlier than at age 30 years for T1D (irrespective of age of diagnosis) and at any age for T2D, 4) screening annually, and 5) testing any time of day. The panel also recommends that an abnormal biomarker test defines asymptomatic preclinical HF (Stage B HF). This diagnosis requires follow-up using transthoracic echocardiography for classification into one of four subcategories of Stage B HF, corresponding to risk of progression to symptomatic clinical HF (Stage C HF). These recommendations will allow identification and management of Stage A and Stage B HF in PWD to prevent progression to Stage C HF or advanced HF (Stage D HF).",yes,no,no,other,"diagnostic, biomarker",natriuretic,,2

This included the definition of critical outcomes, a systematic literature search, appraisal of certainty of evidence, evaluation of biomarker measurement in terms of the balance of desirable and undesirable effects including clinical outcomes, resource use, health inequality, stakeholder acceptance, and implementation. The panel differentiated between three different scopes of applications: cardiac biomarkers as prognostic factors, as tools for risk prediction, and for biomarker-enhanced management strategies.In a modified Delphi process, the task force defined 12 critical outcomes. The systematic literature search resulted in over 25,000 hits, of which 115 full-text articles formed the body of evidence for recommendations. The evidence appraisal indicated heterogeneity in the certainty of evidence across critical outcomes. Further, there was relevant gradient in the certainty of evidence across the three scopes of application. Recommendations were issued and if this was not possible due to limited evidence, clinical practice statements were produced.The ESAIC focused guidelines provide guidance on the perioperative use of cardiac troponin and B-type natriuretic peptides in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, for three different scopes of application.",yes,no,yes,other,biomarker,natriuretic,,2
2023-11-02,37272725,Evaluation of plasma Short chain fatty acid levels as markers for Inflammatory bowel disease.,"Specific variations of short chain fatty acids in fecal samples have been shown for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The aim of this study was to assess if Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are associated with altered concentrations of short chain fatty acids also in blood plasma.Between 2016-2019, Swedish adults referred to a tertiary center for colonoscopy were asked to participate in a cross-sectional study. Individuals with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis as well as individuals with no findings on the colonoscopy (defined as clean colon) were included in the study. Data on colonoscopy findings, blood samples (including haemoglobin, C-reactive protein and short chain fatty acid analysis) as well as a validated lifestyle questionnaire including 277 questions were collected from all participants. Linear regression was used to compare mean concentrations of short chain fatty acids between Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and clean colon.The cohort consisted of 132 individuals with Crohn's disease, 119 with ulcerative colitis and 205 with clean colon. In the crude model, succinic acid was significantly lower (p < 0.05) among patients with Crohn's disease (mean 3.00 µM SE 0.10) and ulcerative colitis (mean 3.13 µM SE 0.10) in comparison to clean colon (mean 3.41 µM SE 0.08), however when adjusting for sex, age and diet the results did not remain statistically significant. No differences in plasma concentration of the other measured short chain fatty acids were detected.Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are not associated with altered short chain fatty acid concentrations in plasma.

2023-11-02,37337895,Metabarcoding of colonic cleansing fluid reveals unique bacterial members of mucosal microbiota associated with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a group of chronic idiopathic inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract associated with the dysbiosis of gut microbiota. Metabarcoding-based profiling of the gut microbiota of IBD patients is generally based on the stool samples collected from individual patients which rarely represent the mucosa-associated microbiota. The ideal sampling strategy for routine monitoring of the mucosal component of IBD has yet to be determined.We hereby compare the microbiota composition of the colonic cleansing fluid (CCF) collected during colonoscopy with stool samples from IBD patients. The relationship between IBD and gut microbiota was revealed through the application of the 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing-based metabarcoding approach. CCF and stool samples were collected from IBD patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.The present study shows significant differences in the microbial composition of CCF samples, presumably indicating changes in the mucosal microbiota of IBD patients as compared to the control group. Short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria under the family Lachnospiraceae, the actinobacterial genus Bifidobacterium, the proteobacterial Sutterella and Raoultella are found to contribute to the microbial dysbiosis of the mucosal flora in IBD patients.CCF microbiota has the capacity to distinguish IBD patients from healthy controls and, thus, may constitute an alternative analysis strategy for the early diagnosis and disease progression in IBD biomarker research.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"diagnostic, biomarker",,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",2

Many researchers have explored the relationship between insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and ROP; however, the results are controversial. This meta-analysis evaluates the correlation between IGF-1 and ROP systematically. We searched for PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE, SinoMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, and 3 Chinese databases up to June 2022. Then, the meta-regression and subgroup analysis were carried out. Twelve articles with 912 neonates were included in this meta-analysis. The results revealed that 4 of 7 covariates account for significant heterogeneity: location, measurement method of IGF-1 levels, collection time of blood sample, and the severity of ROP. The pooled analysis showed that low IGF-1 levels could serve as a risk factor associated with the development and severity of ROP. Serum IGF-1 monitoring in preterm infants after birth will be helpful in the diagnosis and treatment of ROP, and the reference value of IGF-1 should be standardized according to the measurement of IGF-1 and the region, as well as the postmenstrual age of prematurity.",no,yes,yes,other,"diagnostic, biomarker",,retinopathy,2

At that time, no major role was described for this imaging modality. The interest in retromode scanning laser ophthalmoscopy imaging is reemerging with the recent advent of the Mirante that combines scanning laser ophthalmoscopy and optical coherence tomography (Nidek Co., Gamagori, Japan) that can capture retromode images of the fundus.

Methods: 184 eyes of 92 subjects were separated to 3 groups. 68 eyes were in the normal weight group, with a body mass index between 18.5 and 24.5 kg/ m2, 60 eyes were in the overweight group, with a body mass index between 25-29.9 kg/ m2, and 56 eyes were in the obese group, with a body mass index ≥ 30 kg/ m2. All the volunteers were applied visual acuity, ocular motility testing, and slit lamp and mydriatic fundus examination. Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCT-A) scanning was practiced with Optovue (Optovue, Inc; Fremont, CA) on a 6.00 x 6.00 mm macular region, in the central fovea. Results: 184 eyes of ninety-two patients were involved in this prospective study. The vessels' density (VD) in the optic nerve head (ONH) were significantly lower in the overweight and obese adult volunteers compared to the normal weight control group. However, other OCTA parameters (including macular VDs, Foveal avascular zone (FAZ), choriocapillaris plexus (CCP) area) did not demonstrate any significant difference between groups. Subfoveal choroidal thickness (SCT) was higher in the overweight and obese patients when compared to the normal weight control group. Central macular thickness (CMT) did not reveal any significant difference between groups. Conclusion: Even though clinicians are limited in pointing out any differential findings in obese patients only by fundus examination, OCT-A provides a predictable view of the microvascular changes in the retina and choroid in obese patients.

The aim of this review was to highlight the most current optical coherence tomography (OCT) and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) data in MS and to provide information about the possibility of using OCT / OCT-A parameters as biomarkers for screening, diagnosis and monitoring of MS. Methods: To carry out this review, a meticulous literature search was undergone on PubMed between 2014 and the present day, using the following terms: ""multiple"", ""sclerosis"", ""optical"", ""coherence"", ""tomography"" and ""angiography"". Additional studies were found via references, being chosen according to relevance. Results: Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell layer (GCL) were significantly lower in MS patients compared to controls, and correlated with clinical and paraclinical variables, such as visual function, disability, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Retinal capillary plexuses could be higher, lower or the same, and the best OCT-A microvasculature parameter for the detection of MS was the superficial capillary plexus (SCP). The reduced retinal vessel density (VD) was correlated with the disability in MS. Conclusions: OCT and OCT-A parameters could improve the development of retinal biomarkers for screening, early diagnosis and monitoring the disease progression of MS, and they could improve the development of potential future therapies that could slow or stop the course of this incurable disease.

2023-11-02,37522270,Bone mineral density and its influential factors in Chinese patients with newly diagnosed Crohn's disease.,"Bone loss is a common morbidity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Bone mineral density (BMD) measurement is recommended for IBD patients at a high risk of osteoporosis. However, there is a lack of evidence in the need of BMD measurement in patients who are young at the first disease onset. In this study we aimed to investigate the prevalence of low BMD in patients with newly diagnosed Crohn's disease (CD) at 20-50 years of age and the potential risk factors.A single-center, retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted. Medical records of the patients were reviewed and their demographics, clinical characteristics and laboratory test results were collected. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan was performed for BMD measurements; low BMD was defined as Z-score or T-score <-1.0 standard deviation (SD). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine the risk factors for low BMD.A total of 221 patients with CD were included; osteopenia and osteoporosis were identified in 23.1% and 8.6%, and 39.4% and 7.2% of the patients using Z-score and T-score, respectively. Female gender and a higher BMI at diagnosis were protective factors for low BMD.Low BMD is common in patients with newly diagnosed CD aged 20-50 years. Female gender and a higher BMI at diagnosis might protect CD patients from bone loss. Therefore, BMD measurement and early intervention with calcium and vitamin D are recommended for these patients.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,crohn's disease,2

To exert its main functions as a physical and immunological defense barrier, several components of the intestinal barrier act in a concerted and cooperative manner.Herein, we first introduce to the basic organization of the intestinal barrier and then summarize different methods to assess barrier function in and ex vivo. Finally, we provide an in-depth overview of the relevance of intestinal barrier dysfunction in inflammatory bowel diseases.In parallel to a more fundamental understanding of the intestinal barrier as a key component for intestinal integrity is the notion that intestinal barrier defects are associated with a variety of diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases. Recent research has fueled and perpetuated the concept that barrier defects are critical components of disease development, disease behavior, and potentially also an area of therapeutic intervention in IBD patients. Although being far away from standard, new technologies can be used to easily assess barrier healing in IBD and to derive clinical consequences from these findings such as more accurate forecasting of future disease behavior or the identification of novel therapeutic targets.",no,yes,no,other,biomarker,,"inflammatory bowel diseases, ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",2

However, there is a group of very rare chronic ulcerative conditions of the small intestine that has emerged from the intestinal black box nearly 70 years ago, and that has gained interest with the advent of small-bowel capsule endoscopy and device-assisted enteroscopy. These distinct ulcerative enteropathies have come to our attention, and continue to reveal their aetiology and treatment options. Two distinct entities, called cryptogenic multifocal ulcerative stenosing enteritis/enteropathy (CMUSE) and chronic nonspecific multiple ulcers of the small intestine (CNSU) are gaining more clinical attention. CMUSE was first reported in Europe, whereas CNSU was exclusively diagnosed in Japanese patients. With the identification of susceptibility genes impacting prostaglandin metabolism, CMUSE and CNSU have become two distinct pathologies within the group of prostaglandin-associated enteropathies, to be differentiated from medication-induced enteropathies, especially non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID)-induced enteropathy with similar intestinal ulcerations due to interference with prostaglandin metabolism.

Associations between ECG measurements and mortality were estimated as hazard ratios (HR) and adjusted for the Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure (MAGGIC) risk score, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, and index event. Select interactions between ECG measurements, patient characteristics and mortality were examined. Over a median of 10.8 months, there were 824 cardiovascular (CV) deaths (214 sudden) and 1005 all-cause deaths. Median age was 68 years (interquartile range [IQR] 60-76), 24% were women, median ejection fraction was 30% (IQR 23-35), 41% had New York Heart Association class III/IV, and median MAGGIC score was 24 (IQR 19-28). After multivariable adjustment, significant associations existed between heart rate (per 5 bpm: HR 1.02), QRS duration (per 10 ms: HR 1.02), absence of left ventricular hypertrophy (HR 0.64) and CV death, and similarly so with all-cause death (HR 1.02; HR 1.02; HR 0.61, respectively). Contiguous pathologic Q waves were significantly associated with sudden death (HR 1.46), and right ventricular hypertrophy with all-cause death (HR 1.44). The only sex-based interaction observed was for pathologic Q waves on CV (men: HR 1.05; women: HR 1.64, pinteraction  = 0.024) and all-cause death (men: HR 0.99; women: HR 1.57; pinteraction  = 0.010). Whereas sudden death doubled in females, it did not differ among males (male: HR 1.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87-1.79; female: HR 2.50, 95% CI 1.23-5.06; pinteraction  = 0.141).Routine ECG measurements provide additional prognostication of mortality in high-risk HFrEF patients, particularly in women with contiguous pathologic Q waves.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,natriuretic,,2

The aim of this study was to construct the DNA methylation profiles of whole blood of SS patients and healthy controls (HC), and to explore the role of differentially methylated genes in the pathogenesis of the disease.Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing was performed on three SS patients and four HC. The biological function of genes associated with differentially methylated regions (DMRs) was investigated using Gene Ontology functional analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, using network-based key driver analysis (KDA) to find KDA genes. In clinical samples of SS patients and controls, the expression levels of KDA genes were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical analysis. Moreover, the diagnostic value of KDA genes for SS was confirmed using receiver operating characteristic curves.We identified 322 DMRs, annotated as 162 associated genes. Six genes were selected via the number of networks of KDA genes. Differential expression of genes such as human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I, ADAR, and OAS2 was observed in patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the minor salivary glands, which can be used as potential diagnostic biomarkers for SS.Clinical sample validation suggested that HLA class I, ADAR, and OAS2 might play a role in the development of SS.

The pathogenicity of variants was assessed using in silico tools or in vitro splicing assays following the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines.Two hundred sixty-eight distinct pathogenic variants were identified, and 57 were novel. In 580 alleles, 22 noncoding region variants outside canonical splice sites and 4 structural variations were found in 44 alleles accounting for 7.6% of all alleles. Bioinformatics analysis showed the complex mechanism of aberrant splicing productsnatural splice site disruption, branch point destruction, and cryptic splice site activation. Correspondingly, minigene assays validated the various abnormal splicing products, including exon skipping, exon elongation, partial exon deletion, and pseudoexon insertion. WGS identified the first inversion variation in ABCA4.This study systematically depicted the variant profiles of ABCA4 and revealed the missing alleles of patients with ABCA4-RD in a large Chinese cohort.

The differential diagnosis of SS is difficult because several diseases and adverse effects of treatment have a similar clinical picture as SS with sicca syndrome and can even induce alterations in the SG (mimic diseases). Hence, for a long time an SG biopsy was regarded as the diagnostic procedure of choice, especially in SS‑A negative patients, whereas the significance of SD sonography is still controversially discussed.Comparison of typical and atypical changes for SS in the salivary glands in ultrasound and associated histological sections.This article describes six patient cases with antibody positive or negative SS with and without typical SS ultrasound patterns, SS-associated lymphoma, sarcoidosis and IgG4-associated disease. The findings of the sonographic examination of the parotid glands and the associated histology of the SD are explained and put into context.The SSA antibody positive patients with SS show a typical sonographic pattern with hypoechoic foci, especially if the disease has been present for a long time. This pattern can help support the diagnosis of SS. The ultrasound patterns of the mimic diseases sometimes differ significantly from the typical patterns of pSS. The histological examination of the SG helps to corroborate the diagnosis but low histological focus scores, in particular, require a critical synopsis of the clinical, serological and imaging findings.Both salivary gland ultrasound and the histological examination of SG biopsies are justified in the diagnostics and differential diagnosis of SS and sicca syndrome.",no,yes,no,other,diagnostic,,dry eye,2

All statistical analyses were carried out with STATA V.14 software.A total of 54 studies with 38 016 study participants were included in the study. The pooled prevalence of VDD among patients with T2DM was found to be 64.2% (95% CI 60.6% to 67.8%) with a substantial level of heterogeneity (I2=98.2%; p<0.001). Results of the subgroup analysis indicated that the pooled prevalence of VDD among patients with T2DM was highest (70.9%) in African nations and lowest (57.1%) in Middle East countries.

2023-11-02,37798683,"Molecular analyses of ADAMTS-1, -4, -5, and IL-17 a cytokine relationship in patients with ulcerative colitis.","Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that develops due to the impaired immune response in genetically susceptible individuals, and its etiopathogenesis is not fully elucidated. IL-17 A is a cytokine that is produced by a type of immune cell called Th17 cells and is involved in the immune response and inflammation. On the other hand, ADAMTS-1, -4, and - 5 are enzymes that are involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix proteins, including proteoglycans, which are important components of the intestinal wall. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between interleukin 17 (IL-17 A) cytokine, which plays a role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis, and the inflammation-controlled a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS)-1, -4, and - 5 protein members.Bowel tissue samples and blood serum from 51 patients with UC and 51 healthy controls were included in this study. mRNA expression levels of the ADAMTS-1, -4, -5, and IL-17 A were analyzed by RT-qPCR, and immunohistochemical analyses were performed to evaluate ADAMTS-1, -4, -5, and IL-17 A proteins in tissue samples. In addition, ELISA analysis determined serum levels of the ADAMTS-1, -4, -5, and IL-17 A.RT-qPCR results reveal that the expression of ADAMTS-1, -4, -5, and IL-17 A genes in the UC tissue samples were significantly high according to the control tissue samples. Also, ADAMTS-1, -4, -5, and IL-17 A proteins revealed enhanced expression pattern UC groups according to the control. Also, ADAMTS-1, -4, -5, and IL-17 A protein showed cytoplasmic localization patterns in both control and UC groups. The serum levels of ADAMTS-1,-5, and IL-17 A were significantly higher in UC samples than in the control group.We observed a positive correlation between the ADAMTS-1, -5 and IL17A cytokine expression in UC samples. These results provide a new understanding of controlling crucial ADAMTS family protein members by IL-17 A cytokines with UC.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,ulcerative colitis,2
2023-11-02,37803361,Genetic insights into PHARC syndrome: identification of a novel frameshift mutation in ABHD12.,"Mutations in ABHD12 (OMIM: 613,599) are associated with polyneuropathy, hearing loss, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa, and cataract (PHARC) syndrome (OMIM: 612674), which is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease. PHARC syndrome is easily misdiagnosed as other neurologic disorders, such as retinitis pigmentosa, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and Refsum disease, due to phenotype variability and slow progression. This paper presents a novel mutation in ABHD12 in two affected siblings with PHARC syndrome phenotypes. In addition, we summarize genotype-phenotype information of the previously reported patients with ABHD12 mutation.Following a thorough medical evaluation, whole-exome sequencing was done on the proband to look for potential genetic causes. This was followed by confirmation of identified variant in the proband and segregation analysis in the family by Sanger sequencing. The variants were interpreted based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines.A novel pathogenic homozygous frameshift variant, NM_001042472.3:c.601dup, p.(Val201GlyfsTer4), was identified in exon 6 of ABHD12 (ACMG criteria: PVS1 and PM2, PM1, PM4, PP3, and PP4). Through Sanger sequencing, we showed that this variant is co-segregated with the disease in the family. Further medical evaluations confirmed the compatibility of the patients' phenotype with PHARC syndrome.Our findings expand the spectrum of mutations in the ABHD12 and emphasize the significance of multidisciplinary diagnostic collaboration among clinicians and geneticists to solve the differential diagnosis of related disorders. Moreover, a summary based on mutations found so far in the ABHD12 gene did not suggest a clear genotype-phenotype correlation for PHARC syndrome.",no,yes,no,other,biomarker,,retinitis pigmentosa,2
2023-11-02,37805634,Mitochondrial dysfunction promotes microbial composition that negatively impacts on ulcerative colitis development and progression.,"Recent evidence demonstrates potential links between mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In addition, bidirectional interactions between the intestinal microbiota and host mitochondria may modulate intestinal inflammation. We observed previously that mice deficient in the mitochondrial protein MCJ (Methylation-controlled J protein) exhibit increased susceptibility to DSS colitis. However, it is unclear whether this phenotype is primarily driven by MCJ-/- associated gut microbiota dysbiosis or by direct effects of MCJ-deficiency. Here, we demonstrate that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from MCJ-deficient into germ-free mice was sufficient to confer increased susceptibility to colitis. Therefore, an FMT experiment by cohousing was designed to alter MCJ-deficient microbiota. The phenotype resulting from complex I deficiency was reverted by FMT. In addition, we determined the protein expression pathways impacted by MCJ deficiency, providing insight into the pathophysiology of IBD. Further, we used magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize taxa-specific coating of the intestinal microbiota with Immunoglobulin A (IgA-SEQ) in MCJ-deficient mice. We show that high IgA coating of fecal bacteria observed in MCJ-deficient mice play a potential role in disease progression. This study allowed us to identify potential microbial signatures in feces associated with complex I deficiency and disease progression. This research highlights the importance of finding microbial biomarkers, which might serve as predictors, permitting the stratification of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients into distinct clinical entities of the UC spectrum.",no,yes,no,animal,biomarker,,ulcerative colitis,2
2023-11-02,37816947,A retinal imaging system for combined measurement of optic nerve head vascular pulsation and stimulated vasodilation in humans.,"Vascular pulsation at the optic nerve head (ONH) reflects vessel properties. Reduction in the stimulated retinal vasodilatory capacity has been reported in diabetes, but its relation with vascular pulsation is unknown. Here we report a new retinal imaging system for correlative assessment of ONH vascular pulsation and stimulated retinal vasodilation. Retinal reflectance images were acquired before and during light flicker stimulation to quantify arterial and venous vasodilation (DAR, DVR) in subjects with and without diabetic retinopathy (N = 25). ONH vascular pulsation amplitude and frequency (PA, PF), were quantified by curve fitting of periodic intensity waveforms acquired in retinal vasculature (RV) and ONH tissue (ONHT) regions. The relationships between pulsation metrics, heart rate (HR), intraocular pressure (IOP), and vasodilatory responses were evaluated. Pulsation metrics were not significantly different between regions (p ≥ 0.70). In RV, inter-image variabilities of PA and PF were 10% and 6%, whereas inter-observer variabilities were 7% and 2% respectively. In both regions, PF was correlated with HR (p ≤ 0.001). PA was associated with DAR in both regions (p ≤ 0.03), but only with DVR in RV (p ≤ 0.05). Overall, ONH vascular pulsation was associated with stimulated retinal vasodilation, suggesting diabetes may have concomitant effects on retinal vasculature compliance and neurovascular coupling.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinopathy,2

We aimed to systematically estimate the causal relationship between IBD and extracolonic cancers.Independent genetic variants strongly associated with IBD were extracted as instrumental variables from genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted by the International IBD Genetics Consortium including 12,882 IBD patients, 5956 Crohn's disease (CD) patients, and 6968 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. Three sources of cancer GWAS were selected as outcome data. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted to assess the causal effects of IBD on 32 extracolonic cancers. The meta-analysis was applied to assess the combined causal effect with multiple MR results.IBD, CD, and UC have potential causal associations with oral cavity cancer (IBD: OR = 1.180, 95% CI: 1.059 to 1.316, P = 0.003; CD: OR = 1.112, 95% CI: 1.008 to 1.227, P = 0.034; UC: OR = 1.158, 95% CI: 1.041 to 1.288, P = 0.007). Meta-analysis showed a significant positive causal relationship between IBD and breast cancer (OR = 1.059; 95% CI: 1.033 to 1.086; P < 0.0001) as well as a potential causal relationship between CD and breast cancer (OR = 1.029; 95% CI: 1.002 to 1.055; P = 0.032) based on combining multiple MR results.This comprehensive MR analysis suggested that genetically predicted IBD, as well as its subtypes, may be a risk factor in the development of oral cavity and breast cancer.",no,yes,yes,other,biomarker,,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",2
2023-11-02,37818353,"Identification of IL-27 as a novel regulator of major histocompatibility complex class I and class II expression, antigen presentation, and processing in intestinal epithelial cells.","Antigen presentation via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II receptors plays a fundamental role in T cell-mediated adaptive immunity. A dysregulation of this fine-tuned recognition might result in the development of autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases that are characterized by chronic relapsing inflammation of the intestinal tract and a damaged intestinal epithelial barrier. While MHCII receptors are usually expressed by professional antigen presenting cells (APC) only, there is increasing evidence that non-immune cells such as intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) might express MHCII upon stimulation with IFN-γ and thus act as non-professional APC. However, little is known about other factors regulating intestinal epithelial MHC expression. Here, we identify IL-27 as an inducer of different MHCI and MHCII receptor subtypes and the invariant chain (CD74/li) in IEC via the STAT1/IRF1/CIITA axis. CIITA, MHCII, and CD74 expression was significantly increased in IEC from Crohn's disease (CD) patients with active disease compared to controls or CD patients in remission. IEC phagocytosed and digested external antigens and apoptotic cells. IL-27 strongly stimulated antigen processing via the immunoproteasome in a IRF1-dependent manner. In co-culture experiments, antigen-primed IEC strongly enhanced lymphocyte proliferation and IL-2 secretion, dependent on direct cell-cell contact. IL-27 pretreatment of IEC significantly increased CD4+ T cell proliferation and reduced IL-2 levels in lymphocytes in coculture. In summary, we identified IL-27 as a novel regulator of IEC antigen processing and presentation via MHCI and MHCII receptors, underscoring the importance of IEC as non-professional APC.",no,yes,no,other,biomarker,,crohn's disease,2

2023-11-02,37838406,H-Deep-Net: A deep hybrid network with stationary wavelet packet transforms for Retinal detachment classification through fundus images.,"Nowadays, automated disease diagnosis has become a vital role in the medical field due to the significant population expansion. An automated disease diagnostic approach assists clinicians in the diagnosis of disease by giving exact, consistent, and prompt results, along with minimizing the mortality rate. Retinal detachment has recently emerged as one of the most severe and acute ocular illnesses, spreading worldwide. Therefore, an automated and quickest diagnostic model should be implemented to diagnose retinal detachment at an early stage. This paper introduces a new hybrid approach of best basis stationary wavelet packet transform and modified VGG19-Bidirectional long short-term memory to detect retinal detachment using retinal fundus images automatically. In this paper, the best basis stationary wavelet packet transform is utilized for image analysis, modified VGG19-Bidirectional long short-term memory is employed as the deep feature extractors, and then obtained features are classified through the Adaptive boosting technique. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that our proposed method obtained 99.67% sensitivity, 95.95% specificity, 98.21% accuracy, 97.43% precision, 98.54% F1-score, and 0.9985 AUC.

2023-11-02,37845542,Entropy-driven reactions for controlling CRISPR/Cas12a and constructing an electrochemical biosensor for cardiac biomarkers detection.,"An electrochemical biosensor is reported for controlling CRISPR/Cas12a activity through the utilization of entropy-driven reactions, alongside the construction of a highly sensitive biosensor for B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) detection. In the biosensor, entropy-driven reactions are employed to regulate the activity of CRISPR/Cas12a - a gene editing tool - capable of nonspecific cleavage of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). The biosensor architecture encompasses an electrode that is modified with ssDNA probes designed to hybridize with target BNP aptamers. These aptamers, furnished with labeled ssDNA triggers, facilitate the activation of CRISPR/Cas12a through interaction with its guide RNA. Upon the presence of BNP, it associates with the aptamers, subsequently liberating the triggers that instigate the entropy-driven reactions. As a consequence of these reactions, more stable duplexes emerge between the triggers and guide RNA, thereby activating CRISPR/Cas12a. The activated CRISPR/Cas12a subsequently executes cleavage of ssDNA probes residing on the electrode surface, culminating in the generation of an electrochemical signal directly (the calibration plots of differential pulse voltammetric detection were acquired at a working potential of 0.2 V (vs. ref. electrode)) proportional to the BNP concentration. Validation of the biosensor's performance is undertaken, wherein BNP detection is demonstrated in both buffer and human serum samples. Evident in the findings is the biosensor's discernible sensitivity and specificity for BNP detection, exemplified by a detection limit of 13.53 fM and a lack of interference originating from other cardiac biomarkers, respectively. Furthermore, the biosensor's potential to discriminate between healthy individuals and those afflicted by heart failure, predicated on distinctive BNP levels, is illustrated.",yes,no,no,in vitro,"diagnostic, biomarker",natriuretic,,2

All participants underwent a swept-source OCT examination focused on ONH. We differentiated between 3 major types (optic disc morphologic abnormality, papillary/peripapillary tissue defect, and papillary/peripapillary schisis) and 12 subtypes of ONH abnormalities. The prevalence and characteristics of ONH abnormalities and the relationship with VF were analyzed.A total of 857 participants (1389 eyes) were included. Among the 1389 eyes, 91.86%, 68.61%, and 34.92% of them had at least 1, 2, or 3 ONH abnormalities, respectively, which corresponded to 29.55%, 31.79%, and 35.67% of VF defects, respectively. Among the 12 subtypes of the 3 major types, peripapillary hyperreflective ovoid mass-like structure, visible retrobulbar subarachnoid space, and prelaminar schisis were the most common, respectively. Perimetric defects corresponding to OCT abnormalities were more commonly found in eyes with peripapillary retinal detachment, peripapillary retinoschisis, and peripapillary hyperreflective ovoid mass-like structure. Glaucoma-like VF defects were more common in eyes with deep optic cups (28.17%) and with optic disc pit/pit-like change (18.92%).We observed and clarified the ONH structural abnormalities in eyes with nonpathologic high myopia.

2023-11-02,37862328,Predicting of diabetic retinopathy development stages of fundus images using deep learning based on combined features.,"The number of diabetic retinopathy (DR) patients is increasing every year, and this causes a public health problem. Therefore, regular diagnosis of diabetes patients is necessary to avoid the progression of DR stages to advanced stages that lead to blindness. Manual diagnosis requires effort and expertise and is prone to errors and differing expert diagnoses. Therefore, artificial intelligence techniques help doctors make a proper diagnosis and resolve different opinions. This study developed three approaches, each with two systems, for early diagnosis of DR disease progression. All colour fundus images have been subjected to image enhancement and increasing contrast ROI through filters. All features extracted by the DenseNet-121 and AlexNet (Dense-121 and Alex) were fed to the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method to select important features and reduce their dimensions. The first approach is to DR image analysis for early prediction of DR disease progression by Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with selected, low-dimensional features of Dense-121 and Alex models. The second approach is to DR image analysis for early prediction of DR disease progression is by integrating important and low-dimensional features of Dense-121 and Alex models before and after PCA. The third approach is to DR image analysis for early prediction of DR disease progression by ANN with the radiomic features. The radiomic features are a combination of the features of the CNN models (Dense-121 and Alex) separately with the handcrafted features extracted by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Fuzzy colour histogram (FCH), and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) methods. With the radiomic features of the Alex model and the handcrafted features, ANN reached a sensitivity of 97.92%, an AUC of 99.56%, an accuracy of 99.1%, a specificity of 99.4% and a precision of 99.06%.",no,yes,no,other,diagnostic,,retinopathy,2
2023-11-02,37867507,Identification of biomarkers associated with immune scores in diabetic retinopathy.,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) causes irreversible visual impairment in diabetes mellitus (DM) patients. Immunity played a crucial role in DR. Nevertheless, the triggering mechanism of DR was not yet thorough enough. Herein, we aim to identify the immune-associated genes as biomarkers associated with immune scores that can distinguish early DR from DM without DR.In this study, total RNA of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from 15 non-proliferative DR patients and 15 DM patients without DR were collected and the transcriptome sequencing data were extracted. Firstly, the target genes were obtained by intersecting the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which were screened by ""limma"", and the module genes (related to immune scores), which were screened by ""WGCNA"". In order to screen for the crucial genes, three machine learning algorithms were implemented, and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to obtain the diagnostic genes. Moreover, the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to understand the function of diagnostic genes, and analysis of the proportions of immune cells and their association with diagnostic genes was performed to analyze the pathogenesis of DR. Furthermore, the regulatory network of TF-mRNA-miRNA was built to reveal the possible regulation of diagnostic genes. Finally, the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to verify the mRNA level of diagnostic genes.A total of three immune-associated diagnostic genes, namely, FAM209B, POM121L1P, and PTGES, were obtained, and their expression was increased in PBMC samples of DR, and qRT-PCR results confirmed these results. Moreover, the functions of these genes were associated with immune response. The expression of POM121L1P and PTGES was significantly negatively associated with naive B cells, and the expression of FAM209B was significantly negatively associated with immature dendritic cells. Moreover, ESR1 could regulate both FAM209B and PTGES.This study identified three immune-associated diagnostic genes, FAM209B, POM121L1P, and PTGES, as biomarkers associated with immune scores in DR for the first time.

Its progression depends mainly on retinal vasculature and ocular blood flow. Color Doppler imaging (CDI) is a noninvasive imaging technique that measures blood flow velocity. The resistivity index (RI), calculated by the CDI, reflects the vascular resistance distal to the measuring location. RI is independent of the doppler angle and position of the patient, making it a reliable and reproducible parameter. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one study in literature studying the association between resistivity index (RI) of the central retinal artery (CRA) and severity of DR.To determine the association between RI of CRA and severity of DR. To determine the association between RI of CRA and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) biomarkers for DR.Type II diabetics visiting our OPD underwent DR screening and were graded into three categories according to ETDRS classification which include Group A-No diabetic retinopathy (No DR), Group B-Nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (Moderate-Severe-Very Severe NPDR), and Group C-Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). SD-OCT was performed. Ultrasonic color doppler imaging was done. RI of the CRA was noted. It was compared between the three groups and its association with severity of DR and OCT biomarkers (central subfield thickness, cube average thickness and ellipsoid zone disruption) was studied.56 eyes of 28 patients were included in our study with 20 in Group A,14 in Group B, and 22 in Group C. RI of CRA compared within groups showed statistically significant association with severity of DR (P < 0.001). The presenting BCVA (LogMar) showed positive correlation with RI in all groups. OCT biomarker central subfield thickness showed a positive correlation with RI in Groups A (P < 0.001) and B. Ellipsoid zone (EZ) disruption showed a statistically significant association with RI in Group C (P < 0.001).The RI of CRA is a reliable biomarker for the assessment of the severity of DR.

Artificial intelligence (A.I.) applications for preventing vision loss in eye illnesses have developed quickly. Artificial intelligence uses computer programs to execute various activities while mimicking human thought. Machine learning techniques are frequently utilized in the field of ophthalmology. Ophthalmology holds great promise for advancing artificial intelligence, thanks to various digital methods like optical coherence tomography (OCT) and visual field testing. Artificial intelligence has been used in ophthalmology to treat eye conditions impairing vision, including macular holes (M.H.), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and cataracts. The more common occurrence of these diseases has led to artificial intelligence development. It is important to get annual screenings to detect eye diseases such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration. These conditions can cause decreased visual acuity, and it is necessary to identify any changes or progression in the disease to receive appropriate treatment.

2023-11-02,37876509,Biomarkers of ocular allergy and dry eye disease.,"The most common disorders of the ocular surface are dry eye disease (DED) and ocular allergy (OA). These conditions are frequently coexisting with or without a clinical overlap and can cause a severe impact on the patient's quality of life. Therefore, it can sometimes be hard to distinguish between DED and OA because similar changes and manifestations may be present. Atopic patients can also develop DED, which can aggravate their manifestations. Moreover, patients with DED can develop ocular allergies, so these two pathological entities of the ocular surface can be considered as mutual conditions that share the same background.

2023-11-02,37903967,A multidomain bio-inspired feature extraction and selection model for diabetic retinopathy severity classification: an ensemble learning approach.,"Diabetes retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of blindness globally. Early detection of this condition is essential for preventing patients' loss of eyesight caused by diabetes mellitus being untreated for an extended period. This paper proposes the design of an augmented bioinspired multidomain feature extraction and selection model for diabetic retinopathy severity estimation using an ensemble learning process. The proposed approach initiates by identifying DR severity levels from retinal images that segment the optical disc, macula, blood vessels, exudates, and hemorrhages using an adaptive thresholding process. Once the images are segmented, multidomain features are extracted from the retinal images, including frequency, entropy, cosine, gabor, and wavelet components. These data were fed into a novel Modified Moth Flame Optimization-based feature selection method that assisted in optimal feature selection. Finally, an ensemble model using various ML (machine learning) algorithms, which included Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptron, Random Forests, and Logistic Regression were used to identify the various severity complications of DR. The experiments on different openly accessible data sources have shown that the proposed method outperformed conventional methods and achieved an Accuracy of 96.5% in identifying DR severity levels.",no,yes,no,other,diagnostic,,retinopathy,2

Early and accurate detection of DKD is beneficial for patients. The present detection depends on the measurement of albuminuria or the estimated glomerular filtration rate, which is invasive and not optimal; therefore, new detection tools are urgently needed. Meanwhile, a close relationship between diabetic retinopathy and DKD has been reported; thus, we aimed to develop a novel detection algorithm for DKD using artificial intelligence technology based on retinal vascular parameters combined with several easily available clinical parameters in patients with type-2 diabetes.A total of 515 consecutive patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus from Xiangyang Central Hospital were included. Patients were stratified by DKD diagnosis and split randomly into either the training set (70%, N = 360) or the testing set (30%, N = 155) (random seed = 1). Data from the training set were used to develop the machine learning algorithm (MLA), while those from the testing set were used to validate the MLA. Model performances were evaluated.The MLA using the random forest classifier presented optimal performance compared with other classifiers. When validated, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and AUC for the optimal model were 84.5%(95% CI 83.3-85.7), 84.5%(82.3-86.7), 84.5%(82.7-86.3), 0.845(0.831-0.859), and 0.914(0.903-0.925), respectively.A new machine learning algorithm for DKD diagnosis based on fundus images and 8 easily available clinical parameters was developed, which indicated that retinal vascular changes can assist in DKD screening and detection.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,diagnostic,,retinopathy,2

This study aims to demonstrate the correlation between Sjogren's syndrome and H. pylori infection in patients, highlighting various clinical characteristics and risk factors.A single-center retrospective observational study was conducted in patients (n = 224) admitted from January 1, 2012, to February 10, 2021, in the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University (Wenzhou, China). All the recruited subjects with Sjogren's syndrome and H. pylori infection were only included by validating the available medical records online.In this study, a total of 224 patients from January 1, 2012, to February 10, 2021, were diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome. Among them, 94 patients (41.96%) with Sjogren's syndrome were infected with H. pylori. Accordingly, the clinical manifestations, serological and immunological characteristics, as well as gastroscopic biopsy outcomes of the recruited patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) were reported. The multivariable analysis of the dry syndrome patients infected with H. pylori displayed hypergammaglobulinemia (odds ratio [OR], 0.354; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.189-0.663), total cholesterol (OR, 1.158; 95% CI, 0.856-1.550), hypertension (OR, 0.227; 95% CI, 0.114-0.455), Female sex (OR, 5.778; 95% CI, 1.458-22.9), anti-SSA/Ro60 positive (OR, 2.384; 95% CI, 233-4.645), γ-GT (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.99-1.00) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP, OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.99-1.00) levels.Together, our findings demonstrated that hypergammaglobulinemia could be the independent risk factors of H. pylori infection in patients with Sjogren's syndrome, requiring the physician's advice in the future.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,dry eye,2

On endos copic examination, the mucosa from the anal margin to the cecum was erythematous, with loss of vascular transparency. Biopsies of colonic mucosa showed signs of chronic inflammation, consistent with the diagnosis of Ulcerative Colitis, and CMV infection was diagnosed by PCR.Previous studies have suggested that mast cells may have a pathogenic role in the development of UC, however, the clinical significance of these findings is unknown.

2023-11-03,35769016,Lost in Translation: Neurotrophins Biology and Function in the Neurovascular Unit.,"The neurovascular unit (NVU) refers to the functional building unit of the brain and the retina, where neurons, glia, and microvasculature orchestrate to meet the demand of the retina's and brain's function. Neurotrophins (NTs) are structural families of secreted proteins and are known for exerting neurotrophic effects on neuronal differentiation, survival, neurite outgrowth, synaptic formation, and plasticity. NTs include several molecules, such as nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, NT-3, NT-4, and their precursors. Furthermore, NTs are involved in signaling pathways such as inflammation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis in a nonneuronal cell type. Interestingly, NTs and the precursors can bind and activate the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) at low and high affinity. Mature NTs bind their cognate tropomyosin/tyrosine-regulated kinase receptors, crucial for maintenance and neuronal development in the brain and retina axis. Activation of p75NTR results in neuronal apoptosis and cell death, while tropomysin receptor kinase upregulation contributes to differentiation and cell growth. Recent findings indicate that modulation of NTs and their receptors contribute to neurovascular dysfunction in the NVU. Several chronic metabolic and acute ischemic diseases affect the NVU, including diabetic and ischemic retinopathy for the retina, as well as stroke, acute encephalitis, and traumatic brain injury for the brain. This work aims to review the current evidence through published literature studying the impact of NTs and their receptors, including the p75NTR receptor, on the injured and healthy brain-retina axis.",no,yes,no,other,,,"retinopathy, retinal disease",2

The factors that can predict the development of PVR remain to be elucidated.This study evaluates the predictive values of the systemic immune-inflammation index, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio in patients with primary RRD with and without PVR.A total of 150 patients with RRD and 51 age- and sex-matched healthy participants were included in the study. Patients who developed PVR within three months after surgery were enrolled as PVR cases (n = 75, Group 1), and those who did not develop PVR were enrolled in RRD without the PVR group (n = 75, Group 2). Ocular examination findings and medical records of all participants were analysed retrospectively. Peripheral blood samples were collected, and systemic immune-inflammation index, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratios were calculated. The systemic immune-inflammation index calculation formula is: (Neutrophil/lymphocyte) × Platelet.The median neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and systemic immune-inflammation index levels were significantly higher in Group 1 patients compared to Group 2 and the control groups (p = 0.01, for both). However, the groups were similar regarding median platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (p = 0.917). The optimal cut-off values of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and systemic immune-inflammation index were calculated as 1.72 (with 72% sensitivity and 48% specificity) and 407.9 (with 72% sensitivity and 49.3% specificity), respectively, for predicting PVR development in patients with RRD.Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and systemic immune-inflammation index may be useful biomarkers for predicting the risk of PVR development in RRD patients.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinopathy,2
2023-11-03,36535406,Mitochondria and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Retinal Organoids from Patients with Vision Loss.,"Activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), a key regulator of the unfolded protein response, plays a key role in endoplasmic reticulum function and protein homeostasis. Variants of ATF6 that abrogate transcriptional activity cause morphologic and molecular defects in cones, clinically manifesting as the human vision loss disease achromatopsia (ACHM). ATF6 is expressed in all retinal cells. However, the effect of disease-associated ATF6 variants on other retinal cell types remains unclear. Herein, this was investigated by analyzing bulk RNA-sequencing transcriptomes from retinal organoids generated from patients with ACHM, carrying homozygous loss-of-function ATF6 variants. Marked dysregulation in mitochondrial respiratory complex gene expression and disrupted mitochondrial morphology in ACHM retinal organoids were identified. This indicated that loss of ATF6 leads to previously unappreciated mitochondrial defects in the retina. Next, gene expression from control and ACHM retinal organoids were compared with transcriptome profiles of seven major retinal cell types generated from recent single-cell transcriptomic maps of nondiseased human retina. This indicated pronounced down-regulation of cone genes and up-regulation in Müller glia genes, with no significant effects on other retinal cells. Overall, the current analysis of ACHM patient retinal organoids identified new cellular and molecular phenotypes in addition to cone dysfunction: activation of Müller cells, increased endoplasmic reticulum stress, disrupted mitochondrial structure, and elevated respiratory chain activity gene expression.",no,yes,no,in vitro,biomarker,,retinal disease,2
2023-11-03,36775060,Transcriptomic and Chromatin Accessibility Analysis of the Human Macular and Peripheral Retinal Pigment Epithelium at the Single-Cell Level.,"Some human retinal diseases are characterized by pathology that is restricted to specific cell types and to specific regions of the eye. Several disease entities either selectively affect or spare the macula, the retina region at the center of the posterior pole. Photoreceptor cells in the macula are involved in high-acuity vision and require metabolic support from non-neuronal cell types. Some macular diseases involve the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), an epithelial cell layer with several metabolic-support functions essential for the overlying photoreceptors. In the current study, the ways in which RPE confers region-specific disease susceptibility were determined by examining heterogeneity within RPE tissue from human donors. RPE nuclei from the macular and peripheral retina were profiled using joint single-nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing. The expression of several genes differed between macular and peripheral RPE. Region-specific ATAC peaks were found, suggesting regulatory elements used exclusively by macular or peripheral RPE. Across anatomic regions, subpopulations of RPE were identified that appeared to have differential levels of expression of visual cycle genes. Finally, loci associated with age-related macular degeneration were examined for a better understanding of RPE-specific disease phenotypes. These findings showed variations in the regulation of gene expression in the human RPE by region and subpopulation, and provide a source for a better understanding of the molecular basis of macular disease.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinal disease,2

We developed a revised algorithm to distinguish patients with a specific etiology from a nonspecific etiology.Patients with chronic isolated TI followed up from 2007 to 2022 were retrospectively reviewed. A specific (ITB or CD) diagnosis was made based on standardized criteria, and other relevant data were collected. Using this cohort, validation of a previously suggested algorithm was conducted. Furthermore, based on the results of a univariate analysis, a multivariate analysis with bootstrap validation was used to develop a revised algorithm.We included 153 patients (mean age 36.9 ± 14.6 years, males-70%, median duration-1.5 years, range: 0-20 years) with chronic isolated TI of whom 109 (71.2%) received a specific diagnosis (CD-69, ITB-40). On multivariate regression and validation statistics with a combination of clinical, laboratory, radiological, and colonoscopic findings, an optimism corrected c-statistic of 0.975 and 0.958 was obtained with and without histopathological findings, respectively. Revised algorithm, based on these, showed sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and overall accuracy of 98.2% (95% CI: 93.5-99.8), 75.0% (95% CI: 59.7-86.8), 90.7% (95% CI: 85.4-94.2), 94.3% (95% CI: 80.5-98.5) and 91.5%(95% CI:85.9-95.4), respectively. This was more sensitive and specific than the previous algorithm (accuracy 83.9%, sensitivity 95.5%, and specificity 54.6%).We developed a revised algorithm and a multimodality approach to stratify patients with chronic isolated TI into specific and nonspecific etiologies with an excellent diagnostic accuracy, which could potentially avoid missed diagnosis and unnecessary side effects of treatment.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,diagnostic,,crohn's disease,2

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy and its severity were assessed by the Toronto clinical scoring system, neuropathy symptoms score (NSS) and neuropathy disability score. The prevalence of DPN and its risk factors were analysed.A total of 14,908 patients with T2DM were enroled. The prevalence of DPN was 67.6%. Among 10,084 patients with DPN, 4808 (47.7%), 3325 (33.0%), and 1951 (19.3%) had mild, moderate, and severe DPN, respectively. The prevalence of DPN in females was higher than in males (69.0% vs. 66.6%, P = 0.002). The prevalence of DPN increased with age and course of diabetes and decreased with body mass index (BMI) and education level (all P for trend <0.05).

Gut microbiota changes throughout life; however, certain patterns of population changes have been increasingly associated with specific diseases. It has been well established that a disrupted microbiome contributes to central nervous system diseases, including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, and glioma, suggesting a prominent role of microbiome in neurodegenerative diseases. This review summarizes the progress in identifying significant changes in the microbial composition of patients with glaucoma by compiling studies on the association between microbiota and disease progression. Of interest is the relationship between increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma, increased taurocholic acid, decreased glutathione, and a reduction in retinal ganglion cell survival. Connecting these microbes to specific metabolites sheds light on the pathogenic mechanism and novel treatment strategies.

Cornea and conjunctiva have been reported to be the sites of action of lifitegrast. To investigate the pharmacokinetics of lifitegrast, a sensitive analytical method for the determination of lifitegrast in various biological matrices such as plasma and ocular tissues is required. However, only limited information about the analytical method for lifitegrast in biological samples is available. In the present study, we aimed to develop a new liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for the determination of lifitegrast in rabbit plasma, cornea, conjunctiva, and sclera. Lifitegrast-d6 was used as an internal standard (IS). To prepare the biological samples, protein precipitation using acetonitrile was utilized. Analytes were separated from endogenous interferences on an Atlantis dC18 (5 µm, 2.1 × 150 mm), and a mixture of 0.1 % formic acid and acetonitrile was used as the mobile phase. The mass transition of precursor to product ion was monitored at 615.2 → 145.0 for lifitegrast and 621.2 → 145.1 for IS. The calibration curves were linear over the concentration range from 2 to 500 ng/mL for plasma and 5 to 500 ng/mL in ocular tissue homogenates. Intra- and inter-day accuracy ranged from 95.76 to 106.80 % in the plasma and 94.42 to 112.80 % in the ocular tissues. Precision was within 8.56 % in the plasma and 9.72 % in the ocular tissues. The short-term, long-term, auto-sampler, and freeze-thaw stabilities of lifitegrast were validated. The developed method was applied to a pharmacokinetic study of lifitegrast in rabbits. Following ophthalmic administration, only 3.26 % of administered lifitegrast was absorbed into the systemic circulation. Peak tissue concentrations were observed at 0.5 h after dosing, and topically administered lifitegrast was mainly distributed in the cornea and conjunctiva.

2023-11-03,37795729,Retinal Haemorrhage in Newborns in Tertiary Care Hospital.,"Background Retinal haemorrhage in new-born is a clinically common neonatal fundus condition. Although, it usually does not affect the development of visual function, entities like macular haemorrhages may lead to amblyopia causing deterioration of visual function. Such scenario leads to downgrade in quality of life of the affected child. Objective To explore the underlying clinical factors associated with retinal haemorrhage in term new-borns. Method A cross sectional study was conducted involving 136 term neonates admitted in the neonatal intensive care unit of Dhulikhel Hospital. Fundus examination was performed within 2 weeks of delivery. Retinal haemorrhage was graded according to their location in three retinal zones. Result Out of 136 cases examined, 44 (32.35%) of the cases had one of the eyes with retinal haemorrhage. Where grade 1 retinal haemorrhage was accounted in majority of the cases. Birth weight, gestational age, mode of delivery, poor Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, and Respiration (APGAR) Score in 1 and 5 minutes, birth asphyxia, neonatal sepsis and heavy work in antenatal period had statistically significant correlation with occurrence of retinal haemorrhage. Conclusion Our results suggest that spontaneous vaginal delivery, larger birth weight, higher gestational age, birth asphyxia, low Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, and Respiration score, are risk factors for occurrence of neonatal retinal haemorrhage. It is recommended that in neonates with above high-risk factors should undergo targeted fundus screening for early identification and needful interventions.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinal disease,2
2023-11-03,37813075,The chemical constituents and metabolite profiles of Huangqin decoction in normal and ulcerative colitis rats by UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS analysis.,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a recurrent and palliative inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) begins in distal colon and spreads proximally to the entire colon, characterized by mucosal inflammation which reduces patients' quality of life and increases the risk of bowel cancer. Huangqin decoction (HQD), a classical Chinese formula recorded in Treatise on Febrile Diseases has been widely used for the treatment of UC. Studies found that HQD has good curative effect on UC. However, the chemical constituents and metabolites of it has not been fully elucidated due to lack of in vitro and in vivo studies, which also limits the pathogenesis study and clinical application of UC. In this study, a rapid and high-throughput UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS method was established and applied to analyse the chemical constituents and metabolites of HQD. Besides, we established an UC rat model and compared the differences of metabolite profiles between normal and UC rats both in plasma and urine. A total of 139 constituents were chemically defined or tentatively identified, including 98 flavonoids, 10 triterpene saponins, 10 monoterpene glycosides, 4 phenols, 5 phenylethanoid glycosides and 12 other types of compounds. A total of 175 and 147 HQD-related xenobiotics were detected in normal and UC rats, respectively. The main metabolic pathways of HQD were methylation, hydrolysis, hydroxylation, glucuronidation and sulfation. The holistic metabolic profiles of HQD revealed that normal and UC rats had certain differences in drug absorption and metabolism.

2023-11-03,37813209,The effects of ush2a gene knockout on vesicle transport in photoreceptors.,"USH2A (Usher syndrome type 2A) gene mutations are the predominant cause of Usher syndrome type 2, characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and also significant contributors to non-syndromic RP. To date, there is a lack of definitive therapeutic interventions to mitigate the associated disorders caused by USH2A mutations, and the precise pathogenic mechanisms underlying their onset remain unclear. In the present study, we utilized the ush2a knockout zebrafish model to investigate the pathological mechanisms of RP. In late-stage ush2a-/- zebrafish, the outer segments of rods displayed shortened length and decreased number. Anomalous vesicle accumulation was observed at the junction between the inner and outer segments, accompanied by reduced expression and structural damage of actin filaments in the photoreceptor cells. Furthermore, we discovered that Rab8 expression was downregulated and exhibited aberrant localization in ush2a-/- zebrafish. Additionally, we identified an interaction between USH2A and Rab8. Therefore, the knockout of ush2a may potentially affect vesicle transport through the regulation of Rab8, providing a novel target for maintaining the survival of photoreceptor cells. These findings also contribute to our understanding of the potential molecular pathogenesis underlying RP caused by USH2A gene mutations.",no,yes,no,animal,biomarker,,"retinitis pigmentosa, retinal disease",2
2023-11-03,37871271,INFLAMMATORY CELL ACTIVITY IN TREATED NEOVASCULAR AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION: A Histologic Case Study.,"Imaging indicators of macular neovascularization risk can help determine patient eligibility for new treatments for geographic atrophy secondary to age-related macular degeneration. Because type 1 macular neovascularization includes inflammation, we assessed by histology the distribution of cells with inflammatory potential in two fellow eyes with age-related macular degeneration.Two eyes of a White woman in her 90's with type 3 macular neovascularization treated with antivascular endothelial growth factor were prepared for high-resolution histology. Eye-tracked spectral domain optical coherence tomography applied to the preserved donor eyes linked in vivo imaging to histology. Cells were enumerated in the intraretinal, subretinal, and subretinal retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)-basal lamina compartments on 199 glass slides. Cells with numerous organelles were considered to RPE-derived; cells with sparse RPE organelles were considered non-RPE phagocytes.Both eyes had soft drusen and abundant subretinal drusenoid deposit. In the retina and subretinal space, RPE-derived cells, including hyperreflective foci, were common (n = 125 and 73, respectively). Non-RPE phagocytes were infrequent (n = 5 in both). Over drusen, RPE morphology transitioned smoothly from the age-normal layer toward the top, suggesting transdifferentiation. The sub-RPE-basal lamina space had RPE-derived cells (n = 87) and non-RPE phagocytes (n = 49), including macrophages and giant cells.Numerous sub-RPE-basal lamina cells of several types are consistent with the documented presence of proinflammatory lipids in drusen and aged Bruch's membrane. The relatively compartmentalized abundance of infiltrating cells suggests that drusen contents are more inflammatory than subretinal drusenoid deposit, perhaps reflecting their environments. Ectopic RPE occurs frequently. Some manifest as hyperreflective foci. More cells may be visible as optical coherence tomography technologies evolve.",no,yes,no,other,biomarker,,retinal disease,2
2023-11-03,37910517,The rod synapse in aging wildtype and Dscaml1 mutant mice.,"The retina is an intricately organized neural tissue built on cone and rod pathways for color and night vision. Genetic mutations that disrupt the proper function of the rod circuit contribute to blinding diseases including retinitis pigmentosa and congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB). Down Syndrome cell adhesion molecule like 1 (Dscaml1) is expressed by rods, rod bipolar cells (RBCs), and sub-populations of amacrine cells, and has been linked to a middle age onset of CSNB in humans. However, how Dscaml1 contributes to this visual deficit remains unexplored. Here, we probed Dscaml1's role in the maintenance of the rod-to-RBC synapse using a loss of function mouse model. We used immunohistochemistry to investigate the anatomical formation and maintenance of the rod-to-RBC synapse in the young, adult, and aging retina. We generated 3D reconstructions, using serial electron micrographs, of rod spherules and RBCs to measure the number of invaginating neurites, RBC dendritic tip number, and RBC mitochondrial morphology. We find that while rod-to-RBC synapses form and are maintained, similar to wildtype, that there is an increase in the number of invaginating neurites in rod spherules, a reduction in RBC dendritic tips, and reduced mitochondrial volume and complexity in the Dscaml1 mutant retina compared to controls. We also observed precocious sprouting of RBC dendrites into the outer nuclear layer (ONL) of the Dscaml1 mutant retina compared to controls. These results contribute to our knowledge of Dscaml1's role in rod circuit development and maintenance and give additional insight into possible genetic therapy targets for blinding diseases and disorders like CSNB.",no,yes,no,animal,biomarker,,"retinopathy, retinal disease",2

Case-control studies of patients with CD have cataloged alterations in the gut microbiome composition; however, these studies fail to distinguish whether the altered gut microbiome composition is associated with initiation of CD or is the result of inflammation or drug treatment.In this prospective cohort study, 3483 healthy first-degree relatives (FDRs) of patients with CD were recruited to identify the gut microbiome composition that precedes the onset of CD and to what extent this composition predicts the risk of developing CD. We applied a machine learning approach to the analysis of the gut microbiome composition (based on 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing) to define a microbial signature that associates with future development of CD. The performance of the model was assessed in an independent validation cohort.In the validation cohort, the microbiome risk score (MRS) model yielded a hazard ratio of 2.24 (95% confidence interval, 1.03-4.84; P = .04), using the median of the MRS from the discovery cohort as the threshold. The MRS demonstrated a temporal validity by capturing individuals that developed CD up to 5 years before disease onset (area under the curve > 0.65). The 5 most important taxa contributing to the MRS included Ruminococcus torques, Blautia, Colidextribacter, an uncultured genus-level group from Oscillospiraceae, and Roseburia.This study is the first to demonstrate that gut microbiome composition is associated with future onset of CD and suggests that gut microbiome is a contributor in the pathogenesis of CD.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,crohn's disease,2

The questionnaire resulting from the translation into the new language was subject to a pre-test where the comments of the participants were written and considered for the final version of the questionnaire. For the scale validation of the final version of the translated questionnaire, 89 subjects from a non-clinical population, aged 18 to 84 years, were asked to answer the questionnaire (61% were women). One week later, the same questionnaire was repeated by 63 subjects. The internal reliability of the questionnaire was analyzed by Cronbach's alpha, temporal stability by test-retest, and analysis of agreement between measures by the Bland-Altman method.The internal consistency of the translated questionnaire, SPEED-vP was high (α = 0.871) and all questionnaire items contributed to an increase in this index. This consistency was also confirmed to be high in the retest (α = 0.856) and when the sample was stratified by age and sex. The SPEED-complete questionnaire also showed high consistency (α = 0.88). The repeatability of the instrument was high (ICC 0.933; 95% CI: 0.899 and 0.960) and the Bland-Altman plot revealed good agreement between measures.The Standardized Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness in Portuguese (SPEED-vP) showed good psychometric properties for the Portuguese population.

There was no significant difference (P = 0.88) in the number of lesions. There was no significant difference in the 134 cRORA lesions identified on B-scans and the 131 hyperTDs detected on en face OCT images (P = 0.13). A total of 105 iRORA lesions were identified by B-scan assessment; however, 50 of these iRORA lesions met the criteria for persistent hyperTDs on en face OCT images (P < 0.001). When considering the topographic correspondence between B-scan and en face OCT detected lesions, the mean percentage of agreement between B-scan detection of cRORA lesions with en face OCT detection was 97.6 % (P = 0.13).We observed high overall agreement between cRORA lesions identified on B-scans and persistent hyperTDs identified on en face OCT.

Long-term chronic inflammatory conditions elevate the patient's risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Currently, diagnosis requires endoscopy with biopsy. This procedure is invasive and requires a bowel-preparatory regimen, adding to patient burden. Interleukin 12 (IL12) and interleukin 23 (IL23) play key roles in inflammation, especially in the pathogenesis of IBD, and are established therapeutic targets. We propose that imaging of IL12/23 and its p40 subunit in IBD via immuno-PET potentially provides a new noninvasive diagnostic approach. Methods: Our aim was to investigate the potential of immuno-PET to image inflammation in a chemically induced mouse model of colitis using dextran sodium sulfate by targeting IL12/23p40 with a 89Zr-radiolabeled anti-IL12/23p40 antibody. Results: High uptake of the IL12/23p40 immuno-PET agent was exhibited by dextran sodium sulfate-administered mice, and this uptake correlated with increased IL12/23p40 present in the sera. Competitive binding studies confirmed the specificity of the radiotracer for IL12/23p40 in the gastrointestinal tract. Conclusion: These promising results demonstrate the utility of this radiotracer as an imaging biomarker of IBD. Moreover, IL12/23p40 immuno-PET can potentially guide treatment decisions for IBD management.",no,yes,no,animal,"diagnostic, biomarker",,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",2

Evaporative dry eye is frequently associated with meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). The objective of this study was to identify clinical study endpoints related to MGD. Methods: This 22-day, noninterventional, case-control clinical study involved three cohorts with increasing MGD severity: no MGD, mild/moderate MGD, and severe MGD. Symptoms were assessed with an ocular symptom questionnaire grading blurred vision, eye burning, eye dryness, eye pain, light sensitivity, eye itching, eye foreign body sensation, and overall ocular discomfort. Sign assessments included the maximum meibum quality score (MMQS), tear breakup time, Schirmer tear tests, biomicroscopy, and corneal staining. Signs and symptoms were compared between cohorts and study visits. Results: Seventy-five study participants were assigned to the cohorts (25 per cohort). MMQS scores increased with increasing MGD severity, reflecting the selection criteria for the cohorts. Between-visit scores showed a weighted kappa statistic of 0.72 indicating substantial agreement. Mean scores of all assessed symptoms increased with increasing MGD severity. Scores for symptoms showed moderate (κ = 0.41-0.60) to substantial (κ = 0.61-0.80) agreement between visits. Overall ocular discomfort demonstrated the strongest correlation with the MMQS. Conclusion: The MMQS was a reproducible sign of MGD showing good agreement with ocular symptoms. Overall ocular discomfort was well correlated with typical dry eye symptoms and could potentially be used as a single measure of MGD symptoms.

A new category of HF characterized by supra-normal LVEF (>65%), named HF with supra-normal ejection fraction (HFsnEF), has been recently proposed. Some studies reported that patients with supra-normal LVEF might have an increased risk of long-term major adverse cardiovascular events and U-shaped mortality patterns. Currently, the prognosis of HFsnEF is not well established but seems to be associated with an increased risk of long-term major adverse cardiovascular events. It has been reported that HFsnEF is more prevalent in women and is associated with higher prevalence of nonischemic HF, higher blood urea nitrogen plasma levels, lower levels of natriuretic peptides, and to be less likely treated with β blockers. The pathophysiology of HFsnEF would be associated with microvascular dysfunction because of microvascular inflammation or reduced coronary flow reserve, and low stroke volume index with smaller cardiac chamber dimensions and concentric LV geometry. In this study, we systematically reviewed published data on patients with s supra-normal LV function and reported its definition, proposed pathophysiology, phenotypes, diagnostic strategy, and prognosis.",yes,no,yes,other,"diagnostic, biomarker",natriuretic,,2

RGC death is often triggered by axon degeneration in the optic nerve. Here, we study the contributions of dynamic and homeostatic Ca2+ levels to RGC death from axon injury. We find that axonal Ca2+ elevations from optic nerve injury do not propagate over distance or reach RGC somas, and acute and chronic Ca2+ dynamics do not affect RGC survival. Instead, we discover that baseline Ca2+ levels vary widely between RGCs and predict their survival after axon injury, and that lowering these levels reduces RGC survival. Further, we find that well-surviving RGC types have higher baseline Ca2+ levels than poorly surviving types. Finally, we observe considerable variation in the baseline Ca2+ levels of different RGCs of the same type, which are predictive of within-type differences in survival.",no,yes,no,animal,biomarker,,retinal disease,2

However, MC3R knockout (KO) mice also exhibit defective behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to fasting. Here, we demonstrate that MC3R KO mice exhibit defective activation of AgRP neurons in response to fasting, cold exposure, or ghrelin while exhibiting normal inhibition of AgRP neurons by sensory detection of food in the ad libitum-fed state. Using a conditional MC3R KO model, we show that the control of AgRP neuron activation by fasting and ghrelin requires the specific presence of MC3R within AgRP neurons. Thus, MC3R is a crucial player in the responsiveness of the AgRP soma to both hormonal and neuronal signals of energy need.",yes,no,no,animal,biomarker,melanocortin,,2

The VD was automatically calculated as the ratio of the pixel areas of the vessels divided by the total area of the regions by the device.Compared with healthy controls (HCs) (n = 45 eyes), the MDD group (n = 66 eyes) demonstrated significantly lower supranasal and temporal choroidal vessel volume (CVV), temporal choroidal vessel volume index (CVI), and supranasal and temporal choroidal stroma volume (CSV) (all p < 0.05). After adjustment for age and sex, we found that temporal CVV (β = -9.31, p = 0.040) and supranasal (β = -15.28, p = 0.034) and temporal CSV (β = -11.82, p = 0.036) were significantly associated with MDD. Both choroidal thickness and retinal VD indicators did not differ significantly between MDD patients and HCs (both p > 0.05).Conclusions about progressive changes in choroidal vascular structures during the course of MDD are limited by the our cross-sectional study.We found the choroidal VD in MDD was lower compared with HCs, which suggests that decreased choroidal VD is associated with the MDD.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinal disease,2
2023-11-06,37918001,Evaluation of the Performance of a 3D-Printed Smartphone-Based Retinal Imaging Device as a Screening Tool for Retinal Pathology in Mozambique.,"Low-income countries carry approximately 90% of the global burden of visual impairment, and up to 80% of this could be prevented or cured. However, there are only a few studies on the prevalence of retinal disease in these countries. Easier access to retinal information would allow differential diagnosis and promote strategies to improve eye health, which are currently scarce. This pilot study aims to evaluate the functionality and usability of a tele-retinography system for the detection of retinal pathology, based on a low-cost portable retinal scanner, manufactured with 3D printing and controlled by a mobile phone with an application designed ad hoc. The study was conducted at the Manhiça Rural Hospital in Mozambique. General practitioners, with no specific knowledge of ophthalmology or previous use of retinography, performed digital retinographies on 104 hospitalized patients. The retinographies were acquired in video format, uploaded to a web platform, and reviewed centrally by two ophthalmologists, analyzing the image quality and the presence of retinal lesions. In our sample there was a high proportion of exudates and hemorrhages-8% and 4%, respectively. In addition, the presence of lesions was studied in patients with known underlying risk factors for retinal disease, such as HIV, diabetes, and/or hypertension. Our tele-retinography system based on a smartphone coupled with a simple and low-cost 3D printed device is easy to use by healthcare personnel without specialized ophthalmological knowledge and could be applied for the screening and initial diagnosis of retinal pathology.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,diagnostic,,retinal disease,2
2023-11-06,37919055,Discoveries in Retina Physiology and Disease Biology Using Single-Cell RNA Sequencing.,"The retina, a component of the central nervous system, is composed of six distinct neuronal types and various types of glial cells. A technique for single-cell transcriptome analysis called single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can be employed to study the complicated dynamics of several types of retinal cells. It meticulously examines how various cell types express their genes, shedding light on all biological processes. scRNA-seq is an alternative to regular RNA-seq, which cannot identify cellular heterogeneity. Understanding retinal diseases requires research on retinal cell heterogeneity. The identification of novel cell subpopulations can provide information about disease occurrence and progression as well as the specific biological functions of particular cells. We currently have a better understanding of the interactions among the brain, the retina, and its visual pathways thanks to the use of scRNA-seq to examine retinal development and disease pathogenesis. Additionally, this technology offers fresh perspectives on the sensitivity and molecular basis of cell subtypes linked to retinal diseases. Thanks to scRNA-seq technology, we now have a better understanding of the most recent developments and difficulties in retinal development and disorders. We believe that scRNA-seq is an important tool for developing cutting-edge treatments for retinal diseases. This paper presents a systematic review of the history of sRNA-seq technology development and provides an overview of the unique subtypes of retinal cells and the specific gene markers this technology identifies.",no,yes,yes,other,biomarker,,retinal disease,2
2023-11-06,37920076,The Value of Soluble ST2 in Predicting Cardiorenal Syndrome Type 1 in Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients.,"To investigate the predictive value of soluble growth stimulation expressed gene 2 (sST2) for the development of Cardiorenal syndrome type 1 (CRS1) in patients with acute myocardial infarction during hospitalization.A retrospective study included 202 patients with acute myocardial infarction, divided into the CRS1 group (n = 61) and the Non-CRS1 group (n = 141) by the CRS1 occurrence. A logistic regression analysis was applied to find independent predictors of the CRS1 occurrence during hospitalization. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were applied to analyze the predictive values of sST2, N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that sST2, NT-proBNP, eGFR, Multivessel coronary artery disease, and diuretic use were independent predictors of the CRS1 occurrence during hospitalization. Application of ROC curve analysis displayed that sST2 had the largest area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.874, sensitivity of 0.770, and specificity of 0.894; sST2, eGFR, and NT-proBNP as combined predictors had an AUC value of 0.908, sensitivity of 0.820, and specificity of 0.908. The ROC curves of sST2 and the combined predictive indices were compared using MedCalc software (version 19.6.3), and no statistically significant difference was found between the two (p = 0.142). The cutoff values of the three indicators were determined by the maximum Youden index. When sST2 ≥61.8 ng/mL, eGFR ≤80.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 and NT-proBNP ≥1525 pg/mL were classified as abnormal range, it was found that more number of abnormal indicators may be more advantageous of risk stratification in CRS1.sST2 can be used as a novel predictor of the CRS1 occurrence in patients with acute myocardial infarction during hospitalization. sST2, eGFR, and NT-proBNP combined may have better predictive value.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,natriuretic,,2
2023-11-06,37920605,A Prediction Model for Sight-Threatening Diabetic Retinopathy Based on Plasma Adipokines among Patients with Mild Diabetic Retinopathy.,"Accumulating evidence has suggested a link between adipokines and diabetic retinopathy (DR). This study is aimed at investigating the risk factors for sight-threatening DR (STDR) and establishing a prognostic model for predicting STDR among a high-risk population of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).Plasma concentrations of adipokines were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In the case-control set, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to select optimal predictive cytokines for STDR, involving severe nonproliferative DR (NPDR) and proliferative DR. Support vector machine (SVM) was used to examine the possible combination of baseline plasma adipokines to discriminate the patients with mild NPDR who will later develop STDR. An individual prospective cohort with a follow-up period of 3 years was used for the external validation.In both training and testing sets, involving 306 patients with T2DM, median levels of plasma adiponectin (APN), leptin, and fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) were significantly higher in the STDR group than those in mild NPDR. Except for adipsin, the other three adipokines, FABP4, APN, and leptin, were selected by PCA and integrated into SVM. The accuracy of the multivariate SVM classification model was acceptable in both the training set (AUC = 0.81, sensitivity = 71%, and specificity = 91%) and the testing set (AUC = 0.77, sensitivity = 61%, and specificity = 92%). 110 T2DM patients with mild NPDR, the high-risk population of STDR, were enrolled for external validation. Based on the SVM, the risk of each patient was calculated. More STDR occurred in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group, which were grouped by the median value of APN, FABP4, and leptin, respectively. The model was validated in an individual cohort using SVM with the AUC, sensitivity, and specificity reaching 0.77, 64%, and 91%, respectively.Adiponectin, leptin, and FABP4 were demonstrated to be associated with the severity of DR and maybe good predictors for STDR, suggesting that adipokines may play an important role in the pathophysiology of DR development.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinopathy,2
2023-11-06,37922157,Choroidal Hyper-Reflective Foci in Geographic Atrophy.,"The purpose of this study was to describe the presence of choroidal hyper-reflective foci (HRF) on optical coherence tomography (OCT) in patients with geographic atrophy (GA). The relationship between the presence and quantity of choroidal HRF and other clinical and imaging factors was also investigated.A total of 40 participants (40 eyes) with GA and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) were retrospectively analyzed. OCT images were reviewed for the presence, characteristics, and localization of choroidal HRF. The amount of choroidal HRF was quantified in different choroidal layers by two different (i.e. threshold reflectivity and manual counting) methodologies. The primary outcome was to describe and quantify choroidal HRF and correlate them with GA lesion size.Structural OCT images showed that all patients had multiple hyper-reflective deposits in different layers of the choroid. These hyper-reflective deposits in the choroid were located near Bruch's membrane or the edges of the blood vessels, particularly in the Sattler's layer, and none were observed inside the vessels. Choroidal HRF exhibited variable size and shape and varying effects on the posterior signal, including shadowing or hypertransmission. Mean ± SD number of choroidal HRF per B-scan was 21.5 ± 15.4 using the threshold reflectivity methodology and 25.1 ± 16.0 using the manual counting methodology. A significant correlation between the untransformed GA size and number of HRF was found, considering both quantitative strategies.Hyper-reflective dots in the choroid of subjects with GA may be readily identified with structural OCT. These HRF might represent a natural component of the choroid that becomes more visible due to the absence of the retinal pigment epithelium.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinal disease,2
2023-11-06,37922286,Colonic mucosal associated invariant T cells in Crohn's disease have a diverse and non-public T cell receptor beta chain repertoire.,"Mucosal-Associated Invariant T (MAIT) cells are T cells with a semi-invariant T cell receptor (TCR), recognizing riboflavin precursors presented by a non-polymorphic MR1 molecule. As these precursors are produced by the gut microbiome, we characterized the frequency, phenotype and clonality of MAIT cells in human colons with and without Crohn's disease (CD).The transcriptome of MAIT cells sorted from blood and intestinal lamina propria cells from colectomy recipients were compared with other CD8+ T cells. Colon biopsies from an additional ten CD patients and ten healthy controls (HC) were analyzed by flow cytometry. TCR genes were sequenced from individual MAIT cells from these biopsies and compared with those of MAIT cells from autologous blood.MAIT cells in the blood and colon showed a transcriptome distinct from other CD8 T cells, with more expression of the IL-23 receptor. MAIT cells were enriched in the colons of CD patients, with less NKG2D in inflamed versus uninflamed segments. Regardless of disease, most MAIT cells expressed integrin α4β7 in the colon but not in the blood, where they were enriched for α4β7 expression. TCR sequencing revealed heterogeneity in the colon and blood, with few public sequences associated with cohorts.MAIT cells are enriched in the colons of CD patients and disproportionately express molecules (IL-23R, integrin α4β7) targeted by CD therapeutics, to suggest a pathogenic role for them in CD. Public TCR sequences were neither common nor sufficiently restricted to a cohort to suggest protective or pathogenic antigen-specificities.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,crohn's disease,2
2023-11-06,37923770,Wavelet scattering transform application in classification of retinal abnormalities using OCT images.,"To assist ophthalmologists in diagnosing retinal abnormalities, Computer Aided Diagnosis has played a significant role. In this paper, a particular Convolutional Neural Network based on Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) is used to detect one to four retinal abnormalities from Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images. Predefined wavelet filters in this network decrease the computation complexity and processing time compared to deep learning methods. We use two layers of the WST network to obtain a direct and efficient model. WST generates a sparse representation of the images which is translation-invariant and stable concerning local deformations. Next, a Principal Component Analysis classifies the extracted features. We evaluate the model using four publicly available datasets to have a comprehensive comparison with the literature. The accuracies of classifying the OCT images of the OCTID dataset into two and five classes were [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], respectively. We achieved an accuracy of [Formula: see text] in detecting Diabetic Macular Edema from Normal ones using the TOPCON device-based dataset. Heidelberg and Duke datasets contain DME, Age-related Macular Degeneration, and Normal classes, in which we achieved accuracy of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], respectively. A comparison of our results with the state-of-the-art models shows that our model outperforms these models for some assessments or achieves nearly the best results reported so far while having a much smaller computational complexity.",no,yes,no,other,diagnostic,,retinal disease,2
2023-11-06,37925213,Medical concept embedding of real-valued electronic health records with application to inflammatory bowel disease.,"Deep learning approaches are gradually being applied to electronic health record (EHR) data, but they fail to incorporate medical diagnosis codes and real-valued laboratory tests into a single input sequence for temporal modeling. Therefore, the modeling misses the existing medical interrelations among codes and lab test results that should be exploited to promote early disease detection. To find connections between past diagnoses, represented by medical codes, and real-valued laboratory tests, in order to exploit the full potential of the EHR in medical diagnosis, we present a novel method to embed the two sources of data into a recurrent neural network. Experimenting with a database of Crohn's disease (CD), a type of inflammatory bowel disease, patients and their controls (~1:2.2), we show that the introduction of lab test results improves the network's predictive performance more than the introduction of past diagnoses but also, surprisingly, more than when both are combined. In addition, using bootstrapping, we generalize the analysis of the imbalanced database to a medical condition that simulates real-life prevalence of a high-risk CD group of first-degree relatives with results that make our embedding method ready to screen this group in the population.",no,yes,no,other,diagnostic,,crohn's disease,2
2023-11-06,37925610,E2/ER signaling mediates the meiotic arrest of goat intrafollicular oocytes induced by follicle-stimulating hormone.,"The increased production of high-quality oocytes lies at the heart of the search to accelerate the reproduction of high-quality breeding livestock using assisted reproductive technology. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) maintains the arrest of oocyte meiosis during early follicular development in vivo and promotes the synchronous maturation of nucleus and cytoplasm to improve oocyte quality. However, the mechanism by which FSH maintains meiotic arrest in oocytes is still not fully understood. Oocytes spontaneously resume meiosis once released from the arrested state. In this study, we isolated goat antral follicles with a diameter of 2.0-4.0 mm, cultured them in vitro either with or without added FSH, and finally collected the oocytes to observe their meiotic state. The results showed that FSH effectively inhibited the meiotic recovery of oocytes in follicles [4 h: control (n = 84) vs. with FSH (n = 86), P = .0115; 6 h: control (n = 86) vs. FSH (n = 85), P = 0.0308; and 8 h: control (n = 95) vs. FSH (n = 101), P = 0.0039]. FSH significantly inhibited the downregulation of natriuretic peptide receptor 2 (NPR2) expression and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) synthesis during follicular culture in vitro (P < 0.05). Further exploration found that FSH promoted the synthesis of 17β-estradiol (E2) (P = .0249 at 4 h and P = .0039 at 8 h) and maintained the expression of the estrogen nuclear receptor ERβ, but not the estrogen nuclear receptor ERα during follicle culture in vitro (P = .0190 at 2 h, and P = .0100 at 4 h). In addition, E2/ER (estrogen nuclear receptors ERα and ERβ) mediated the inhibitory effect of FSH on the downregulation of NPR2 expression and cGMP synthesis, ultimately preventing the meiotic recovery of oocytes (P < .05). In summary, our study showed that FSH-induced estrogen production in goat follicles, and the E2/ER signaling pathway, both mediated meiotic arrest in FSH-induced goat oocytes.",yes,no,no,in vitro,biomarker,natriuretic,,2
2023-11-07,37725107,Identifying the severity of diabetic retinopathy by visual function measures using both traditional statistical methods and interpretable machine learning: a cross-sectional study.,"To determine the extent to which diabetic retinopathy severity stage may be classified using machine learning (ML) and commonly used clinical measures of visual function together with age and sex.We measured the visual function of 1901 eyes from 1032 participants in the Northern Ireland Sensory Ageing Study, deriving 12 variables from nine visual function tests. Missing values were imputed using chained equations. Participants were divided into four groups using clinical measures and grading of ophthalmic images: no diabetes mellitus (no DM), diabetes but no diabetic retinopathy (DM no DR), diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macular oedema (DR no DMO) and diabetic retinopathy with DMO (DR with DMO). Ensemble ML models were fitted to classify group membership for three tasks, distinguishing (A) the DM no DR group from the no DM group; (B) the DR no DMO group from the DM no DR group; and (C) the DR with DMO group from the DR no DMO group. More conventional multiple logistic regression models were also fitted for comparison. An interpretable ML technique was used to rank the contribution of visual function variables to predictions and to disentangle associations between diabetic eye disease and visual function from artefacts of the data collection process.The performance of the ensemble ML models was good across all three classification tasks, with accuracies of 0.92, 1.00 and 0.84, respectively, for tasks A-C, substantially exceeding the accuracies for logistic regression (0.84, 0.61 and 0.80, respectively). Reading index was highly ranked for tasks A and B, whereas near visual acuity and Moorfields chart acuity were important for task C. Microperimetry variables ranked highly for all three tasks, but this was partly due to a data artefact (a large proportion of missing values).Ensemble ML models predicted status of diabetic eye disease with high accuracy using just age, sex and measures of visual function. Interpretable ML methods enabled us to identify profiles of visual function associated with different stages of diabetic eye disease, and to disentangle associations from artefacts of the data collection process. Together, these two techniques have great potential for developing prediction models using untidy real-world clinical data.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,diagnostic,,retinopathy,2
2023-11-07,37840316,A near-infrared fluorescent probe for detecting hydrogen sulfide with high selectivity in cells and ulcerative colitis in mice.,"Although hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a well-known toxic gas, its vital role as a gas transmitter in various physiological and pathological processes of living systems cannot be ignored. Relevant investigations indicate that endogenous H2S is involved in the development of ulcerative colitis pathology and is overexpressed in ulcerative colitis, and hence can be considered as an ulcerative colitis biomarker. Herein, an isophorone-xanthene-based NIR fluorescent probe (IX-H2S) was constructed to image H2S. Owing to its large conjugated structure, the probe exhibits a near-infrared emission wavelength of 770 nm with a large Stokes shift (186 nm). Moreover, IX-H2S has excellent selectivity for the detection of H2S without interference from other analytes including thiols. In addition, the probe has been successfully applied not only in fluorescence imaging of endogenous and exogenous H2S in living cells, but also in imaging of H2S in normal and ulcerative colitis mice. Encouraged by the eminent performance, IX-H2S is expected to be a potent ""assistant"" for the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis.",no,yes,no,animal,"diagnostic, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,2

Accordingly, cirrhotic cardiomyopathy, a frequently underdiagnosed condition, is becoming a growing health problem. In the last 20 years, cardioselective biomarkers have been investigated for their diagnostic and prognostic properties for numerous conditions. The aim of this article is to review the literature on the relationship between the most commonly used cardioselective biomarkers (cardiac troponins I and T, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, and heart-type fatty-acid binding protein) and the presence, functional stage, and clinical outcomes of liver cirrhosis. Elevated plasma levels of these biomarkers have been reported in patients with liver cirrhosis, and there is mounting evidence on their predictive value for clinical outcomes in this disease. In addition, elevated plasma levels of these biomarkers have been reported in patients before, during, and after liver transplantation, but in fewer studies. Due to their predictive value for clinical outcomes, we advocate the use of these markers in patients with liver cirrhosis and cirrhotic cardiomyopathy, as well as in candidates for liver transplant.",yes,no,no,other,"diagnostic, biomarker",natriuretic,,2

AH, VH, and SE proteins were analyzed using the Olink Target 96 platform (1196 protein assays in total). We compared these three matrices in terms of quantification overlap, principal component analysis, and correlation.In the AH, VH, and SE samples, 841, 917, and 1133 proteins, respectively, were consistently quantified above the limit of detection in more than 30% of patients. AH and VH shared 812 of these proteins. AH and VH samples overlapped along principal component 1, but SE samples were distinct. We identified 490 proteins with significant (false discovery rate [FDR]-adjusted P < 0.05) and relevant correlations (correlation coefficient > 0.5) between AH and VH, compared to only 33 and 40 proteins for VH and SE and for AH and SE, respectively.Due to a close correlation between protein concentrations in the AH and VH and a clear difference from the SE, AH has the potential to serve as a substitute for VH and may hold significance in identifying protein biomarkers and novel targets related to retinal diseases.This study further supports AH as a clinically suitable source of protein biomarkers in retinal diseases. In addition, the identified AH and VH correlations can inform the selection of protein biomarker candidates in future translational research.",no,yes,no,other,biomarker,,retinal disease,2

However, even in their absence, defecatory symptoms secondary to dyssynergic defecation or fecal incontinence may occur. Although anorectal manometry is well established as the diagnostic test of choice for defecatory symptoms, its utility in the assessment of patients with IPAA is less established. In this systematic review, we critically evaluate the existing evidence for anopouch manometry (APM).A total of 393 studies were identified, of which 6 studies met all inclusion criteria. Studies were not pooled given different modalities of testing with varying outcome measures.Overall, less than 10% of symptomatic patients post-IPAA were referred to APM. The prevalence of dyssynergic defecation as defined by the Rome IV criteria in symptomatic patients with IPAA ranged from 47.0% to 100%. Fecal incontinence in patients with IPAA was characterized by decreased mean and maximal resting anal pressure on APM, as well as pouch hyposensitivity. The recto-anal inhibitory reflex was absent in most patients with and without incontinence.Manometry alone is an imperfect assessment of pouch function in patients with defecatory symptoms, and confirmatory testing may need to be performed with dynamic imaging.",no,yes,yes,human non-RCT,diagnostic,,ulcerative colitis,2

We sought to develop and externally validate a risk model for new-onset HF admission in patients with AF and those without a history of HF.Using two multicentre, prospective, observational AF registries, RAFFINE (2857 patients, derivation cohort) and SAKURA (2516 patients without a history of HF, validation cohort), we developed a risk model by selecting variables with regularized regression and weighing coefficients by Cox regression with the derivation cohort. External validity testing was used for the validation cohort. Overall, 148 (5.2%) and 104 (4.1%) patients in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively, developed HF during median follow-ups of 1396 (interquartile range [IQR]: 1078-1820) and 1168 (IQR: 844-1309) days, respectively. In the derivation cohort, age, haemoglobin, serum creatinine, and log-transformed brain natriuretic peptide were identified as potential risk factors for HF development. The risk model showed good discrimination and calibration in both derivations (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.80 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76-0.84]; Hosmer-Lemeshow, P = 0.257) and validation cohorts (AUC: 0.78 [95%CI 0.74-0.83]; Hosmer-Lemeshow, P = 0.475).The novel risk model with four readily available clinical characteristics and biomarkers performed well in predicting new-onset HF admission in patients with AF.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,"diagnostic, biomarker",natriuretic,,2

The study aim was to examine ancestry and subtype variations of children newly diagnosed with IBD.Children newly diagnosed with IBD enrolled into the Canadian Children Inflammatory Bowel Disease Network inception cohort study were categorized into 8 ancestral groups. Prospectively collected data at diagnosis and follow-up were compared between ancestral groups.Among 1447 children (63.2% Crohn's disease, 30.7% ulcerative colitis), 67.8% were European, 9.4% were South Asian, 3.8% were West Central Asian and Middle Eastern, 2.3% were African, 2.2% were East/South East Asian, 2.0% were Caribbean/Latin/Central/South American, 9.9% were mixed, and 2.6% were other. Children of African descent with ulcerative colitis had an older age of diagnosis compared with children of European descent (median 15.6 years vs 13.3 years; P = .02). Children of European descent had a higher proportion of positive family history with IBD (19.3% vs 12.1%; P = .001) compared with children of non-European descent. Children of European descent also had a lower proportion of immigrants and children of immigrants compared with children of non-European descent (9.8% vs 35.9%; P < .0001; and 3.6% vs 27.2%; P < .0001, respectively) .Important differences exist between different ancestral groups in pediatric patients with IBD with regard to age of diagnosis, family history, and immigrant status.

2023-11-08,36813262,Enhancing the appropriateness of eyecare delivery: the iCaretrack approach.,"Optometrists play an integral role in primary eyecare services, including prevention, diagnosis, and management of acute and chronic eye conditions. Therefore, it remains essential that the care they provide be timely and appropriate to ensure the best patient outcomes and optimal utilisation of resources. However, optometrists continuously face many challenges that can affect their ability to provide appropriate care (i.e., the care in line with evidence-based clinical practice guidelines). To address any resulting evidence-to-practice gaps, programs are needed that support and enable optometrists to adopt and utilise the best evidence in clinical practice. Implementation science is a field of research that can be applied to improving the adoption and maintenance of evidence-based practices in routine care, through systematic development and application of strategies or interventions to address barriers to evidence-based practice. This paper demonstrates an approach using implementation science to enhance optometric eyecare delivery. A brief overview of the methods used to identify existing gaps in appropriate eyecare delivery is presented. An outline of the process used to understand the behavioural barriers responsible for such gaps follows, involving theoretical models and frameworks. The resulting development of an online program for optometrists to enhance their capability, motivation, and opportunity to provide evidence-based eyecare is described, using the Behaviour Change Model and co-design methods. The importance of and methods used in evaluating such programs are also discussed. Finally, reflections on the experience and key learnings from the project are shared. While the paper focuses on experiences in improving glaucoma and diabetic eyecare in the Australian optometry context, this approach can be adapted to other conditions and contexts.",no,yes,no,other,,,retinopathy,2
2023-11-08,37075483,Density of Biopsy Sampling Required to Ensure Accurate Histological Assessment of Inflammation in Active Ulcerative Colitis.,"Histological response to treatment is an important outcome in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). The accuracy of biopsy-based measurements of inflammation may be limited by error imposed by natural microscopic heterogeneity on the scale of individual biopsies. We determined the magnitude of this error, its histological correlates, and the density of biopsy sampling within mucosal regions of interest required to meet specified benchmarks for accuracy.A total of 994 sequential 1-mm digital microscopic images (virtual biopsies) from consecutive colectomies from patients with clinically severe UC were scored by 2 pathologists. Agreement statistics for Geboes subscores and Nancy (NHI) and Robarts Histological Indices (RHI) between random samples from 1 to 10 biopsies and a reference mean score across a 2-cm region of mucosa were calculated using bootstrapping with 2500 iterations.The agreement statistics improved across all indices as the biopsy density increased, with the largest proportional gains occurring with addition of the second and third biopsies. One biopsy achieved moderate to good agreement with 95% confidence for NHI and RHI corresponding to scale-specific errors of 0.40 (0.25-0.66) and 3.02 (2.08-5.36), respectively; and 3 biopsies achieved good agreement with 95% confidence corresponding to scale-specific errors of 0.22 (0.14-0.39) and 1.87 (1.19-3.25), respectively. Of the individual histological features, erosions and ulcers had the greatest impact on the agreement statistics.In the setting of active colitis, up to 3 biopsy samples per region of interest may be required to overcome microscopic heterogeneity and ensure accurate histological grading.",no,yes,no,other,diagnostic,,ulcerative colitis,2
2023-11-08,37260352,Creeping Fat in the Pathogenesis of Crohn's Disease: An Orchestrator or a Silent Bystander?,"Although the phenomenon of hypertrophied adipose tissue surrounding inflamed bowel segments in Crohn's disease has been described since 1932, the mechanisms mediating the creeping fat formation and its role in the pathogenesis of the disease have not been fully unraveled. Recent advances demonstrating the multiple actions of adipose tissue beyond energy storage have brought creeping fat to the forefront of scientific research. In Crohn's disease, dysbiosis and transmural injury compromise the integrity of the intestinal barrier, resulting in an excessive influx of intraluminal microbiota and xenobiotics. The gut and peri-intestinal fat are in close anatomic relationship, implying a direct reciprocal immunologic relationship, whereas adipocytes are equipped with an arsenal of innate immunity sensors that respond to invading stimuli. As a result, adipocytes and their progenitor cells undergo profound immunophenotypic changes, leading to adipose tissue remodeling and eventual formation of creeping fat. Indeed, creeping fat is an immunologically active organ that synthesizes various pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, profibrotic mediators, and adipokines that serve as paracrine/autocrine signals and regulate immune responses. Therefore, creeping fat appears to be involved in inflammatory signaling, which explains why it has been associated with a higher severity or complicated phenotype of Crohn's disease. Interestingly, there is growing evidence for an alternative immunomodulatory function of creeping fat as a second barrier that prevents an abnormal systemic inflammatory response at the expense of an increasingly proliferating profibrotic environment. Further studies are needed to clarify how this modified adipose tissue exerts its antithetic effect during the course of Crohn's disease.",no,yes,no,other,biomarker,,crohn's disease,2
2023-11-08,37266570,A Novel 8-Predictors Signature to Predict Complicated Disease Course in Pediatric-onset Crohn's Disease: A Population-based Study.,"The identification of patients at high risk of a disabling disease course would be invaluable in guiding initial therapy in Crohn's disease (CD). Our objective was to evaluate a combination of clinical, serological, and genetic factors to predict complicated disease course in pediatric-onset CD.Data for pediatric-onset CD patients, diagnosed before 17 years of age between 1988 and 2004 and followed more than 5 years, were extracted from the population-based EPIMAD registry. The main outcome was defined by the occurrence of complicated behavior (stricturing or penetrating) and/or intestinal resection within the 5 years following diagnosis. Lasso logistic regression models were used to build a predictive model based on clinical data at diagnosis, serological data (ASCA, pANCA, anti-OmpC, anti-Cbir1, anti-Fla2, anti-Flax), and 369 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms.In total, 156 children with an inflammatory (B1) disease at diagnosis were included. Among them, 35% (n = 54) progressed to a complicated behavior or an intestinal resection within the 5 years following diagnosis. The best predictive model (PREDICT-EPIMAD) included the location at diagnosis, pANCA, and 6 single nucleotide polymorphisms. This model showed good discrimination and good calibration, with an area under the curve of 0.80 after correction for optimism bias (sensitivity, 79%, specificity, 74%, positive predictive value, 61%, negative predictive value, 87%). Decision curve analysis confirmed the clinical utility of the model.A combination of clinical, serotypic, and genotypic variables can predict disease progression in this population-based pediatric-onset CD cohort.

Despite this, there are few data about personality profiles' characterization in UC patients and about correlation of their psychopathological profile with their intestinal microbiota.The aim of our study is to analyze the psychopathological and personality profile of UC patients and correlate it with specific signatures of their gut microbiota.This is a prospective interventional longitudinal cohort study. We enrolled consecutive patients affected by UC attending to the IBD Unit of Center for Digestive Disease of ""A. Gemelli"" IRCCS Hospital in Rome and a group of healthy subjects, matched for specific characteristics. Each patient was evaluated by a gastroenterologist and a psychiatrist. Moreover, all participants underwent psychological tests and a collection of stool samples.We recruited 39 UC patients and 37 healthy subjects. Most patients showed high level of alexithymia, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, as well as neuroticism and hypochondria, with obsessive-compulsive features at the behavioral level, which significantly impaired their quality of life and abilities at work. Gut microbiota analysis in UC patients demonstrated an increase in actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Saccharibacteria (TM7), with a reduction in verrucomicrobia, euryarchaeota and tenericutes.Our study confirmed the presence of high levels of psycho-emotional distress in UC patients, alongside alterations of the intestinal microbiota, and highlighted some families and genera of bacteria (Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus, Veillonella, Klebsiella, and Clostridiaceae) as potential markers of an altered gut-brain axis in these patients.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,ulcerative colitis,2

When the somatic ""second hit"" is a deletion mutation, the heterozygosity due to the first hit is lost (""loss of heterozygosity""). As the rate of germline mutations is almost two orders of magnitude lower than that of somatic mutations, de-novo germline mutations causing autosomal recessive diseases in carriers of inherited heterozygous mutations are not common. We delineate a case of high myopia presenting at infancy with mild diminution of retinal responses. Exome sequencing identified a paternally inherited apparently homozygous missense mutation in RBP3. Chromosomal microarrays delineated a de-novo germline heterozygous deletion encompassing RBP3, verified through revision of WES data. Thus, we demonstrate an inherited RBP3 missense mutation complemented by a de-novo germline RBP3 deletion, causing loss of heterozygosity of the inherited mutation. We describe a novel RBP3 missense mutation, report the first isolated RBP3 deletion, and demonstrate infantile high myopia as an initial presentation of RBP3 disease. Notably, we highlight de-novo germline deletion mutations causing ""loss of heterozygosity"" of inherited heterozygous mutations, culminating in autosomal recessive diseases, and discuss the scarce literature.",no,yes,no,other,biomarker,,retinal disease,2

Deep learning models can be trained to segment the retinal layers for biomarker extraction. However, the onset of ND can have an impact on the neural tissue, which can lead to the degraded performance of models not exposed to images displaying signs of disease during training. We present a fully automatic approach for the retinal layer segmentation in multiple neurodegenerative disorder scenarios, using an annotated dataset of patients of the most prevalent NDs: Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and essential tremor, along with healthy control patients. Furthermore, we present a two-part, comprehensive study on the effects of ND on the performance of these models. The results show that images of healthy patients may not be sufficient for the robust training of automated segmentation models intended for the analysis of ND patients, and that using images representative of different NDs can increase the model performance. These results indicate that the presence or absence of patients of ND in datasets should be taken into account when training deep learning models for retinal layer segmentation, and that the proposed approach can provide a valuable tool for the robust and reliable diagnosis in multiple scenarios of ND.",no,yes,no,other,"diagnostic, biomarker",,retinal disease,2
2023-11-08,37889193,"Circulating Cardiovascular Biomarkers in Cancer Therapeutics-Related Cardiotoxicity: Review of Critical Challenges, Solutions, and Future Directions.","Cardiotoxicity is a growing concern in the oncology population. Transthoracic echocardiography and multigated acquisition scans have been used for surveillance but are relatively insensitive and resource intensive. Innovative imaging techniques are constrained by cost and availability. More sensitive, cost-effective cardiotoxicity surveillance strategies are needed. Circulating cardiovascular biomarkers could provide a sensitive, low-cost solution. Biomarkers such as troponins, natriuretic peptides (NPs), novel upstream signals of oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis as well as panomic technologies have shown substantial promise, and guidelines recommend baseline measurement of troponins and NPs in all patients receiving potential cardiotoxins. Nonetheless, supporting evidence has been hampered by several limitations. Previous reviews have provided valuable perspectives on biomarkers in cancer populations, but important analytic aspects remain to be examined in depth. This review provides comprehensive assessment of critical challenges and solutions in this field, with focus on analytical issues relating to biomarker measurement and interpretation. Examination of evidence pertaining to common and serious forms of cardiotoxicity reveals that improved study designs incorporating larger, more diverse populations, registry-based approaches, and refinement of current definitions are key. Further efforts to harmonize biomarker methodologies including centralized biobanking and analyses, novel decision limits, and head-to-head comparisons are needed. Multimarker algorithms incorporating machine learning may allow rapid, personalized risk assessment.

We sought to demonstrate the associations between increased baseline NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) and adverse renal outcomes in patients with moderate-to-severe acute kidney injury. Methods and Results We reviewed electronic medical records of consecutive patients with acute kidney injury stage 2 and 3 admitted to the Cleveland Clinic between September 2011 and December 2021. Patients with NT-proBNP levels collected before renal consultation or dialysis initiation were included. Adverse renal outcomes included dialysis requirement and dialysis dependence defined as patients undergoing dialysis within 72 hours before hospital discharge or in-hospital mortality. In our study cohort (n=3811), 2521 (66%) patients underwent dialysis, 1619 (42%) patients became dialysis dependent, and 1325 (35%) patients had in-hospital mortality. After adjusting for cardiorenal risk factors, compared with the lowest quartile, the highest quartile of NT-proBNP (≥18 215 pg/mL) was associated with increased likelihood of dialysis requirement (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.36 [95% CI, 1.87-2.99]), dialysis dependence (adjusted OR, 1.89 [95% CI, 2.53-1.34]), and in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR, 1.34 [95% CI, 1.01-1.34]).

Cytokines are associated with the development and progression in pediatric IBD. We measured cytokine levels in pediatric IBD patients to assess their potential function as biomarkers in disease assessment.In this prospective cohort study, we enrolled 33 children with IBD. All patients were in stable remission for 3 months on enrollment. Patients who developed a relapse within six months after enrollment were classified as relapsers. Blood sampling was performed at enrolment and for relapsers in relapse and post-relapse. Serum concentrations of 14 cytokines, chemokines and growth factors (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12p40, IP-10, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-8, MIP-1α, MCP-1, MCP-3, G-CSF, GM-CSF) were measured simultaneously using multiplex bead-based sandwich immunoassay on Luminex 100 system.MCP-1 was significantly higher in CD patients compared to UC patients at each disease stage: stable remission (P<0.048), unstable remission (P<0.013), relapse (P<0.026) and post-relapse (P<0.024). G-CSF was significantly increased in UC patients developing a relapse and in post-relapse stage compared to UC patients in remission (P<0.02 and p<0.03, respectively).MCP-1 showed potential as a diagnostic biomarker in CD patients independent of disease activity as it was able to discriminate between subtypes of pediatric IBD.

2023-11-08,37932491,Deciphering salivary microbiome signature in Crohn's disease patients with different factors contributing to dysbiosis.,"Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. An imbalanced microbiome (dysbiosis) can predispose to many diseases including CD. The role of oral dysbiosis in CD is poorly understood. We aimed to explore microbiome signature and dysbiosis of the salivary microbiome in CD patients, and correlate microbiota changes to the level of inflammation. Saliva samples were collected from healthy controls (HC) and CD patients (n = 40 per group). Salivary microbiome was analyzed by sequencing the entire 16S rRNA gene. Inflammatory biomarkers (C-reactive protein and calprotectin) were measured and correlated with microbiome diversity. Five dominant species were significantly enriched in CD, namely Veillonella dispar, Megasphaera stantonii, Prevotella jejuni, Dolosigranulum pigrum and Lactobacillus backii. Oral health had a significant impact on the microbiome since various significant features were cariogenic as Streptococcus mutans or periopathogenic such as Fusobacterium periodonticum. Furthermore, disease activity, duration and frequency of relapses impacted the oral microbiota. Treatment with monoclonal antibodies led to the emergence of a unique species called Simonsiella muelleri. Combining immunomodulatory agents with monoclonal antibodies significantly increased multiple pathogenic species such as Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Loss of diversity in CD was shown by multiple diversity indices. There was a significant negative correlation between gut inflammatory biomarkers (particularly calprotectin) and α-diversity, suggesting more inflammation associated with diversity loss in CD. Salivary dysbiosis was evident in CD patients, with unique microbiota signatures and perturbed species that can serve as disease biomarkers or potential targets for microbiota modulation. The interplay of various factors collectively contributed to dysbiosis, although each factor probably had a unique effect on the microbiome. The emergence of pathogenic bacteria in the oral cavity of CD patients is alarming since they can disturb gut homeostasis and induce inflammation by swallowing, or hematogenous spread of microbiota, their metabolites, or generated inflammatory mediators.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,crohn's disease,2

A total of 120 patients harboring acute myocardial infarction who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) at our hospital were included. Their general clinical data were analyzed, and comparisons were made regarding the levels of inflammatory factors, oxidative stress markers, heart pump function, and cardiac function. The correlation between cardiac oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine response was assessed using Pearson's linear correlation. Following treatment, significant reductions were seen in the serum levels of cortisol, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), C-reactive protein (CRP), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and catalase (CAT) compared to pre-treatment levels. Conversely, the levels of growth hormone (GH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), cardiac output (CO), and cardiac index (CI) were significantly elevated. Serum cortisol (r = 0.481, P = .001), BNP (r = 0.437, P = .001), CRP (r = 0.542, P = .001), STAT3 (r = 0.835, P = .001), TSH (P = .001), IL-8 (r = 0.867, P = .001), TNF-α (r = 0.439, P = .001), and cardiac oxidative stress demonstrated significantly positive correlations (P < .05). Additionally, a significant negative correlation was found between GH (r = -0.654, P = .001) and immune balance (P < .05).

2023-11-08,37933608,Epidemiology of geographic atrophy and its precursor features of intermediate age-related macular degeneration.,"Globally age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness with a significant impact on quality of life. Geographic atrophy (GA) is the atrophic late form of AMD and its prevalence increases markedly with age with around 1 in 5 persons aged 85 and above having GA in at least one eye. Bilateral GA leads to severe visual impairment thus posing a significant burden on patients, careers and health providers. The incidence and prevalence of GA varies across different geographic regions, with the highest rates in those of European ancestry. Although heterogeneity in definitions of GA and reporting strategy can explain some of the discrepancies, the data overall are consistent in showing a lower prevalence in other ethnicities such as those of Asian heritage. This is at present unexplained but thought to be due to the existence of protective factors such as differences in eye pigmentation, diet, environmental exposures and genetic variability. This review covers key aspects of the prevalence and incidence of the ocular precursor features of GA (large drusen, pigmentary abnormalities and reticular pseudo-drusen), the late stage of GA and factors that have been known to be associated with modifying risk including systemic, demographic, environment, genetic and ocular.

Recently, two therapies have been approved by the US FDA. However, given the nature of their treatment effect, which primarily involves a relative decrease in disease progression, discerning the individual treatment response at the individual level may not be readily apparent. Thus, clinical decision-making may have to rely on the quantification of the slope of GA progression before and during treatment. A panel of imaging modalities and artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms are available for such quantifications.

We sought to analyse potential commonalities between pSS transcriptomic signatures and signatures of various drugs or specific knock-in or knock-down genes.Gene expression from peripheral blood samples of patients with pSS was compared with that of healthy controls in two cohorts and three public databases. In each of the five datasets, we analysed the 150 most up- and downregulated genes between pSS patients and controls with regard to the differentially expressed genes resulting from the biological action on nine cell lines of 2837 drugs, 2160 knock-in and 3799 knock-down genes in the Connectivity Map database.We analysed 1008 peripheral blood transcriptomes from five independent studies (868 patients with pSS and 140 healthy controls). Eleven drugs could represent potential candidate drugs, with histone deacetylases and PI3K inhibitors among the most significantly associated. Twelve knock-in genes were associated with a pSS-like profile and 23 knock-down genes were associated with a pSS-revert profile. Most of those genes (28/35, 80%) were interferon-regulated.This first drug repositioning transcriptomic approach in SS confirms the interest of targeting interferons and identifies histone deacetylases and PI3K inhibitors as potential therapeutic targets.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,dry eye,2

The aim of this study was to describe the clinical and genetic features of a cohort of Chinese patients carrying biallelic BBS gene variants.We recruited 34 patients from 31 unrelated pedigrees who carried biallelic pathogenic variants in BBS genes. All patients underwent ophthalmic and systematic evaluations, as well as comprehensive molecular genetic analyses. Ultimately, 14 patients were followed up over time.We identified 47 diseasing-causing variants in 10 BBS genes; 33 were novel. Diagnosis of BBS and non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa (RP) were established in 28 patients from 27 pedigrees and 6 patients, respectively. The two most prevalent genes in patients with BBS were BBS2 and BBS4, accounting for 51.8% of the probands. The patients exhibited clinical heterogeneity, from patients with all six primary clinical components to patients suffering from non-syndromic RP. The common components were retinal dystrophy, polydactyly, and obesity, with frequencies of 78.6% to 100%, while renal anomaly frequencies were only 7.1%. Patients exhibited early and severe visual defects and retinal degeneration. Patients with biallelic missense variants in BBS2 suffered fewer clinical symptoms and mild visual impairment. Patients with BBS10 variants tended to have cone dystrophy.Our study defined the mutated gene profiles and established the configuration of the variation frequencies for each BBS gene in Chinese patients.

Patients diagnosed with DED were stratified into seven clusters using a previously established symptom-based stratification algorithm for DED. Characteristics of the patients in stratified clusters were compared.In total, 426 participants were included (median age [interquartile range]; 63 [48-72] years; 357 (83.8%) women). Among them, 291 (68.3%) participants were diagnosed with DED and successfully stratified into seven clusters. The J-OSDI total score was highest in cluster 1 (61.4 [52.2-75.0]), followed by cluster 5 (44.1 [38.8-47.9]). The tear film breakup time was the shortest in cluster 1 (1.5 [1.1-2.1]), followed by cluster 3 (1.6 [1.0-2.5]). The J-OSDI total scores from the stratified clusters in this study and those from the clusters identified in the previous study showed a significant correlation (r = 0.991, P < 0.001).The patients with DED who visited ophthalmologists were successfully stratified by the previously established algorithm for the general population, uncovering patterns for their seemingly heterogeneous and variable clinical characteristics of DED.

Multimodal imaging was screened for the presence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and aneurysms/polyps. Imaging features facilitating the diagnosis of PAT1/PCV were analysed.In total, 49 eyes of 44 patients with a clinical PNV diagnosis were included, of which 42 (85.7%) had PNV and 7 (14.3%) represented misdiagnosed PAT1/PCV. SFCT was comparable (PNV: 377 ± 92 vs. PAT1/PCV: 400 ± 83 µm; p = 0.39). Whereas no difference was detected in total pigment epithelium detachment (PED) diameter (p = 0.46), maximum PED height was significantly higher in the PAT1/PCV group (199 ± 31 vs. 82 ± 46, p < 0.00001). In a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the optimum cutoff for defining ""peaking PED"" was 158 µm with an area under the curve of 0.969, a sensitivity of 1.0 (95% CI: 0.59-1.0), and a specificity of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.84-0.99).

2023-11-09,37364272,Endometriosis of the Appendix: When Appendicitis Is Less Than Straightforward.,"We present a case report of a 49-year-old female with a history of ulcerative colitis who originally presented to the general surgery clinic after an incidental finding on computed tomography was concerning for a dilated, fluid-filled appendix. She ultimately underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy. The pathology returned consistent with early acute appendicitis, with endometrial tissue along the outer wall of the appendix. We then performed a literature review regarding appendiceal masses and the occurrence of endometriomas and/or endometriosis of the appendix. A PubMed search was performed using the key words of appendix and appendicitis and endometrioma. Specific articles were examined mentioning the occurrence of endometriomas of the appendix and isolated endometriosis of the appendix. Between 2% and 6% of cases of appendicitis present due to an appendiceal mass, usually an inflammatory phlegmon. A variety of other causes, including primary malignancy, secondary malignancy, and combinations of pathologies, may lead to the eventual removal of the appendix. Specifically, endometriosis of the appendix is reported in less than 1% of females on post-appendectomy pathologic analysis. Although specific symptoms may guide a provider, there are few distinguishing symptoms that would point a provider toward a different etiology, to include malignancy, for appendicitis. Further information is needed to determine when a patient has an increased risk for an underlying pathology when presenting with appendicitis. This information will help drive continued treatment and lead to improved screening for appendiceal masses.",no,yes,no,other,,,ulcerative colitis,2

2023-11-09,37550534,A retrospective analysis of vitamin B6 deficiency and associated changes of gut microbes in Crohn's disease.,"Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are at risk of micronutrient deficiencies, particularly during flares. Vitamin B6 is required for the proper development of brain, nerves, and many other parts of the body. However, limited studies are available to describe the prevalence, relevance and consequences of vitamin B6 deficiencies in IBD. We aim to estimate the prevalence of vitamin B6 deficiencies in Crohn's disease (CD) patients, to identify associated risk factors and to explore the alteration of intestinal microbiota related to vitamin B6 status.A total of 360 CD patients and 55 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients from Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital of Tongji University were included. Serum vitamin B6 concentrations were collected from the computerized laboratory data. The logistic regression was used for statistical analysis. Fecal-associated microbiota was also analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing in another 20 CD patients (10 of vitamin B6 normal, 10 of vitamin B6 deficiency).The prevalence of vitamin B6 abnormality was significantly higher in CD than in UC patients. Logistic regression analysis showed that small bowel lesion, ileocolonic lesion (L3), extraintestinal manifestations, ileal resection, and usage of immunosuppressor were independently associated with abnormal vitamin B6 in CD. Interestingly, the microbial structure presented significant differences between two CD groups. PICRUSt2 prediction revealed that some enzymes and metabolic pathways between the two groups were significantly different.Collectively, our analysis showed that vitamin B6 reduction occurred frequently in patients with CD and affected the intestinal flora of patients.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,crohn's disease,2
2023-11-09,37750425,Arf6 is required for endocytosis and filamentous actin assembly during angiogenesis in vitro.,"Endocytosis is a process vital to angiogenesis and vascular homeostasis. In pathologies where supraphysiological growth factor signaling underlies disease etiology, such as in diabetic retinopathy and solid tumors, strategies to limit chronic growth factor signaling by way of blunting endocytic processes have been shown to have tremendous clinical value. ADP ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6) is a small GTPase that promotes the assembly of actin necessary for clathrin-mediated and clathrin-independent endocytosis. In its absence, growth factor signaling is greatly diminished, which has been shown to ameliorate pathological signaling input in diseased vasculature. However, it is less clear if there are bystander effects related to loss of Arf6 on angiogenic behaviors. Our goal was to provide an analysis of Arf6's function in angiogenic endothelium, focusing on its role in actin and endocytosis as well as sprouting morphogenesis.Primary endothelial cells were cultured in both 2D and 3D environments. Here, endothelial cells were fixed and stained for various proteins or transfected with fluorescently-tagged constructs for live-cell imaging.We found that Arf6 localized to both filamentous actin and sites of endocytosis in two-dimensional culture. Loss of Arf6 distorted both apicobasal polarity and reduced the total cellular filamentous actin content, which may be the primary driver underlying gross sprouting dysmorphogenesis in its absence.Our findings highlight that endothelial Arf6 is a potent mediator of both actin regulation and endocytosis and is required for proper sprout formation.",no,yes,no,in vitro,biomarker,,retinopathy,2
2023-11-09,37768732,TBC1D32 variants disrupt retinal ciliogenesis and cause retinitis pigmentosa.,"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common inherited retinal disease (IRD) and is characterized by photoreceptor degeneration and progressive vision loss. We report 4 patients presenting with RP from 3 unrelated families with variants in TBC1D32, which to date has never been associated with an IRD. To validate TBC1D32 as a putative RP causative gene, we combined Xenopus in vivo approaches and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived (iPSC-derived) retinal models. Our data showed that TBC1D32 was expressed during retinal development and that it played an important role in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) differentiation. Furthermore, we identified a role for TBC1D32 in ciliogenesis of the RPE. We demonstrated elongated ciliary defects that resulted in disrupted apical tight junctions, loss of functionality (delayed retinoid cycling and altered secretion balance), and the onset of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition-like phenotype. Last, our results suggested photoreceptor differentiation defects, including connecting cilium anomalies, that resulted in impaired trafficking to the outer segment in cones and rods in TBC1D32 iPSC-derived retinal organoids. Overall, our data highlight a critical role for TBC1D32 in the retina and demonstrate that TBC1D32 mutations lead to RP. We thus identify TBC1D32 as an IRD-causative gene.",no,yes,no,in vitro,biomarker,,retinal disease,2

Here, we find the convergent evolution of enhanced Arr-1/RHO all-trans-retinal sequestration in owls and deep-diving whales. Statistical analyses reveal a parallel acceleration of Arr-1 evolutionary rates in these lineages, which is associated with the introduction of a rare Arr-1 mutation (Q69R) into the RHO-Arr-1 binding interface. Using in vitro assays, we find that this single mutation significantly enhances RHO-all-trans-retinal sequestration by ∼30%. This functional convergence across 300 million years of evolutionary divergence suggests that Arr-1 and RHO may play an underappreciated role in the photoprotection of the eye, with potentially vast clinical significance.",no,yes,no,other,biomarker,,retinal disease,2
2023-11-09,37806108,Simultaneous detection method for two cardiac disease protein biomarkers on a single chip modified with mixed aptamers using surface plasmon resonance.,"A simultaneous detection method for two cardiac disease protein biomarkers present in serum samples on a single planar gold chip using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is described. The detection of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), which are known as acute myocardial infarction (AMI) biomarkers, with predetermined clinically relevant concentrations was performed using mixed aptamers specific to each protein tethered on a single gold surface. After the binding of NT-proBNP and/or TNF-α to the mixed aptamers, an antibody specific to each target protein was injected to form a surface sandwich complex to improve selectivity. In order to adjust the dynamic ranges in the known clinically relevant concentration significantly different for NT-proBNP (0.13-0.24 nM) and TNF-α (0.5-3 pM), the surface density ratios of the corresponding pair of aptamer and antibody were first systematically determined, which were the 1:1 mixed aptamer chip with 40 nM anti-NT-proBNP and 100 nM anti-TNF-α. This allowed to establish the distinct dynamic ranges of 0.05-0.5 nM for NT-proBNP and 0.1-5 pM for TNF-α in a buffer, along with detection and quantification limits of 0.03 and 0.19 nM for NT-proBNP and 0.06 and 0.21 pM for TNF-α, respectively. The changes in refractive unit (RU) values observed when exposing both proteins at different concentrations alongside the corresponding fixed concentration of antibodies onto the 1:1 mixed aptamer chip were then correlated to the sum of RU values measured when using the injection of individual protein for evaluating each protein concentration. With a complete characterization of the simultaneous quantification of two protein concentrations in the buffer, the mixed aptamer chip was finally employed for direct measurements of NT-proBNP and TNF-α concentrations in undiluted serum samples from healthy controls and AMI patients. The results of simultaneous SPR measurements for the two proteins in the serum samples were further compared to the individual protein concentration results using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.",yes,no,no,in vitro,biomarker,natriuretic,,2

However, their common mechanism is not fully understood. Herein, we examined the underlying network of molecular action associated with developing this complication. Datasets were downloaded from the GEO database. We performed enrichment and protein-protein interaction analyses and screened key genes. We used external datasets to confirm the diagnostic performance for these hub genes. Transcription factor and microRNA regulatory networks were constructed for the validated hub genes. Finally, drug prediction and molecular docking validation were performed. We identified 62 common DEGs, many of which were enriched regarding inflammation and immune response. 5 DEGs were found as key hub genes (IGSF6, MMP9, S100A8, MNDA, and NCF2). They had high diagnostic performance in external datasets. Functional enrichment of these five hub genes showed that they were associated with the adaptive immune response. The Type 1T helper cell showed the most association among all cell types related to AMI and pSS. We identified 36 common TFs and 49 identical TF-miRNAs. The drugs, including Benzo, dexamethasone, and NADP, were predicted as potential therapeutic agents. Herein, we revealed common networks involving pSS and AMI etiologies.

Periodic examination of the retina can help in spotting these abnormalities in the early stage. However, to deal with today's large population, computerized retinal image analysis is preferred over manual inspection. The precise extraction of the retinal vessel is the first and decisive step for clinical applications. Every year, many more articles are added to the literature that describe new algorithms for the problem at hand. The majority of the review article is restricted to a fairly small number of approaches, assessment indices, and databases. In this context, a comprehensive review of different vessel extraction methods is inevitable. It includes the development of a first-hand classification of these methods. A bibliometric analysis of these articles is also presented. The benefits and drawbacks of the most commonly used techniques are summarized.

This retrospective study investigated the peripheral vascular features and macular vascular structure of unaffected fellow eyes in patients with unilateral Coats' disease using multimodal imaging tools. We analysed images of patients, including bilateral ultra-widefield imaging, fluorescein angiography (FA), ultra-widefield FA, or standard fundus photography. Available bilateral optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) images were used for macular vascular structure analysis. OCT-A parameters, including foveal avascular zone (FAZ), perfusion index, and vessel density (VD) in the superficial and deep capillary plexuses (SCP, DCP), were calculated using Image J software. The mean age at diagnosis was 34.5 ± 17.9 years. The mean final best-corrected visual acuity of the affected eyes was logMAR 0.78 ± 0.79, while that of the fellow eyes was logMAR 0.04 ± 0.12. Ten fellow eyes had microaneurysms (47.6%), two had tortuous vessel abnormalities (9.5%), and 11(52.4%) had abnormal vascular findings on FA. Although there was a trend towards larger DCP FAZ (1.201 ± 0.086 vs. 1.072 ± 0.226), and lower DCP VD (8.593 ± 1.583 vs. 10.827 ± 3.392) in the affected eyes as measured by the Cirrus machine, the difference was not statistically significant between affected and fellow eyes when measured using the Zeiss Cirrus machine (P = 0.686, P = 0.343, respectively). However, when measured with the Spectralis machine, DCP FAZ was larger in affected eyes (0.828 ± 0.426 vs. 0.254 ± 0.092, P = 0.002) and DCP VD was lower in affected eyes (6.901 ± 2.634 vs. 17.451 ± 7.207, P = 0.002) compared to the fellow eyes, while other parameters showed no significant variations.

2023-11-10,36581531,Exploring the contribution of ARMS2 and HTRA1 genetic risk factors in age-related macular degeneration.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of severe irreversible central vision loss in individuals over 65 years old. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have shown that the region at chromosome 10q26, where the age-related maculopathy susceptibility (ARMS2/LOC387715) and HtrA serine peptidase 1 (HTRA1) genes are located, represents one of the strongest associated loci for AMD. However, the underlying biological mechanism of this genetic association has remained elusive. In this article, we extensively review the literature by us and others regarding the ARMS2/HTRA1 risk alleles and their functional significance. We also review the literature regarding the presumed function of the ARMS2 protein and the molecular processes of the HTRA1 protein in AMD pathogenesis in vitro and in vivo, including those of transgenic mice overexpressing HtrA1/HTRA1 which developed Bruch's membrane (BM) damage, choroidal neovascularization (CNV), and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), similar to human AMD patients.

2023-11-10,36599784,Endpoints for clinical trials in ophthalmology.,"With the identification of novel targets, the number of interventional clinical trials in ophthalmology has increased. Visual acuity has for a long time been considered the gold standard endpoint for clinical trials, but in the recent years it became evident that other endpoints are required for many indications including geographic atrophy and inherited retinal disease. In glaucoma the currently available drugs were approved based on their IOP lowering capacity. Some recent findings do, however, indicate that at the same level of IOP reduction, not all drugs have the same effect on visual field progression. For neuroprotection trials in glaucoma, novel surrogate endpoints are required, which may either include functional or structural parameters or a combination of both. A number of potential surrogate endpoints for ophthalmology clinical trials have been identified, but their validation is complicated and requires solid scientific evidence.

In addition, RRD can occur as a multifactorial disease through a combined effect of multiple genetic variants and non-genetic risk factors. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the spectrum of hereditary disorders involving RRD. We discuss genotype-phenotype correlations of these monogenic disorders, and describe genetic variants associated with RRD through multifactorial inheritance. Furthermore, we evaluate our current understanding of the molecular disease mechanisms of RRD-associated genetic variants on collagen proteins, proteoglycan versican, and the TGF-β pathway.

Dysregulation of the diurnal clearance of photoreceptor outer segment tips has been implicated in age-related retinal degeneration, but it remains to be clarified how the circadian phagocytic activity of RPE cells is modulated by senescence. In this study, we used the human RPE cell line ARPE-19 to investigate whether hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced senescence in ARPE-19 cells alters the circadian rhythm of their phagocytic activity. After synchronization of the cellular circadian clock by dexamethasone treatment, the phagocytic activity of normal ARPE-19 cells exhibited significant 24-h oscillation, but this oscillation was modulated by senescence. The phagocytic activity of senescent ARPE-19 cells increased constantly throughout the 24-h period, which still exhibited blunted circadian oscillation, accompanied by an alteration in the rhythmic expression of circadian clock genes and clock-controlled phagocytosis-related genes. The expression levels of REV-ERBα, a molecular component of the circadian clock, were constitutively increased in senescent ARPE-19 cells. Furthermore, pharmacological activation of REV-ERBα by its agonist SR9009 enhanced the phagocytic activity of normal ARPE-19 cells and increased the expression of clock-controlled phagocytosis-related genes. Our present findings extend to understand the role of circadian clock in the alteration of phagocytic activity in RPE during aging.

IUS-BP, MH and BWT > 3 mm had a sensitivity of 78.3%, 65.2% and 69.6% and a specificity of 93.3%, 92.2% and 96.7%, respectively. The combination of these three alterations increased the specificity up to 100%, whilst decreased sensitivity to 56.5%.Among several US parameters suggestive of IBD, the increased BWT, MH and altered echopattern are independent predictors of IBD.

2023-11-10,37499857,Optical coherence tomography angiography in diabetic retinopathy.,"There remain many unanswered questions on how to assess and treat the pathology and complications that arise from diabetic retinopathy (DR). Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a novel and non-invasive three-dimensional imaging method that can visualize capillaries in all retinal layers. Numerous studies have confirmed that OCTA can identify early evidence of microvascular changes and provide quantitative assessment of the extent of diseases such as DR and its complications. A number of informative OCTA metrics could be used to assess DR in clinical trials, including measurements of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ; area, acircularity, 3D para-FAZ vessel density), vessel density, extrafoveal avascular zones, and neovascularization. Assessing patients with DR using a full-retinal slab OCTA image can limit segmentation errors and confounding factors such as those related to center-involved diabetic macular edema. Given emerging data suggesting the importance of the peripheral retinal vasculature in assessing and predicting DR progression, wide-field OCTA imaging should also be used. Finally, the use of automated methods and algorithms for OCTA image analysis, such as those that can distinguish between areas of true and false signals, reconstruct images, and produce quantitative metrics, such as FAZ area, will greatly improve the efficiency and standardization of results between studies. Most importantly, clinical trial protocols should account for the relatively high frequency of poor-quality data related to sub-optimal imaging conditions in DR and should incorporate time for assessing OCTA image quality and re-imaging patients where necessary.",no,yes,no,other,"diagnostic, biomarker",,retinopathy,2

2023-11-10,37565977,Interleukin-6 in Patients With Heart Failure and Preserved Ejection Fraction.,"Interleukin (IL)-6 is a central inflammatory mediator and potential therapeutic target in heart failure (HF). Prior studies have shown that IL-6 concentrations are elevated in patients with HF, but much fewer data are available in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).This study aims to determine how IL-6 relates to changes in cardiac function, congestion, body composition, and exercise tolerance in HFpEF.Clinical, laboratory, body composition, exercise capacity, physiologic and health status data across 4 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-sponsored trials were analyzed according to the tertiles of IL-6.IL-6 was measured in 374 patients with HFpEF. Patients with highest IL-6 levels had greater body mass index; higher N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, C-reactive protein, and tumor necrosis factor-α levels; worse renal function; and lower hemoglobin levels, and were more likely to have diabetes. Although cardiac structure and function measured at rest were similar, patients with HFpEF and highest IL-6 concentrations had more severely impaired peak oxygen consumption (12.3 ± 3.3 mL/kg/min 13.1 ± 3.1 mL/kg/min 14.4 ± 3.9 mL/kg/min, P < 0.0001) as well as 6-minute walk distance (276 ± 107 m vs 332 ± 106 m vs 352 ± 116 m, P < 0.0001), even after accounting for increases in IL-6 related to excess body mass. IL-6 concentrations were associated with increases in total body fat and trunk fat, more severe symptoms during submaximal exercise, and poorer patient-reported health status.IL-6 levels are commonly elevated in HFpEF, and are associated with greater symptom severity, poorer exercise capacity, and more upper body fat accumulation.

2023-11-10,37574123,Latest advances in white spot syndromes: New findings and interpretations.,"White spot syndromes (WSS) pose challenges in the field of ophthalmology, particularly in terms of accurate diagnosis and effective management. However, recent advancements in multimodal imaging (MMI) have significantly contributed to our understanding of WSS, allowing for improved characterization of these inflammatory chorioretinopathies. By employing various imaging modalities, including fundus fluorescein angiography, indocyanine green angiography, fundus autofluorescence, optical coherence tomography (OCT), ultra-widefield imaging, and OCT angiography, researchers and clinicians have gained valuable insights into the underlying pathophysiological changes and clinical progression of WSS. Furthermore, MMI has unveiled novel and atypical variants within the spectrum of WSS, expanding our knowledge in this field. Notably, the identification of secondary forms of WSS occurring concurrently with unrelated chorioretinal disorders has suggested a potential autoimmune mechanism underlying these conditions. The introduction of MMI has also facilitated a more comprehensive evaluation of previously ill-defined entities, such as acute zonal occult outer retinopathy, leading to improved diagnostic criteria and enhanced recognition of distinct features. This review paper provides a comprehensive overview of the latest advances and interpretations in WSS. By integrating MMI into the diagnosis and management of these conditions, this review aims to enhance patient outcomes and provide valuable insights into the complexities surrounding WSS.",no,yes,no,other,diagnostic,,"retinopathy, retinal disease",2
2023-11-10,37611892,Identification of novel biomarkers for retinopathy of prematurity in preterm infants by use of innovative technologies and artificial intelligence.,"Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a leading cause of preventable vision loss in preterm infants. While appropriate screening is crucial for early identification and treatment of ROP, current screening guidelines remain limited by inter-examiner variability in screening modalities, absence of local protocol for ROP screening in some settings, a paucity of resources and an increased survival of younger and smaller infants. This review summarizes the advancements and challenges of current innovative technologies, artificial intelligence (AI), and predictive biomarkers for the diagnosis and management of ROP. We provide a contemporary overview of AI-based models for detection of ROP, its severity, progression, and response to treatment. To address the transition from experimental settings to real-world clinical practice, challenges to the clinical implementation of AI for ROP are reviewed and potential solutions are proposed. The use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) technology is also explored, providing evaluation of subclinical ROP characteristics that are often imperceptible on fundus examination. Furthermore, we explore several potential biomarkers to reduce the need for invasive procedures, to enhance diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficacy. Finally, we emphasize the need of a symbiotic integration of biologic and imaging biomarkers and AI in ROP screening, where the robustness of biomarkers in early disease detection is complemented by the predictive precision of AI algorithms.",no,yes,no,other,"diagnostic, biomarker",,retinopathy,2

However, primary non-responders to initial treatment constitute 20-40% of cases. The causes of this phenomenon are still unknown. We aim to investigate the impact of the caspase 9 (CASP9) gene variants on the variable reactions of CD patients to anti-TNF therapy. The study group included 196 diagnosed and clinically characterized CD Polish patients following anti-TNF therapy. The sequence of the CASP9 gene was analyzed using next-generation and Sanger sequencing and was analyzed with the response to biological treatment. Using the RT-qPCR analysis, we estimated the CASP9 gene mRNA level in colon biopsies material from inflamed and non-inflamed tissue (21 CD patients: 14 responders and seven non-responders to anti-TNF therapy and six controls), as well as in vitro in a peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from CD patients (seven responders and seven non-responders to anti-TNF therapy) and eight controls. Our findings indicated association of variants rs1052571 and rs4645978 with response to anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Moreover, we observed tendency for reduced expression after incubation with anti-TNF in the group of CD patients, in contrast to the control group. Our results suggest that response to anti-TNF therapy in CD patients may be an effect of variants of the CASP9 gene as a key effector of the internal pathway of apoptosis; however, further population and functional research are necessary.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,crohn's disease,2
2023-11-10,37660456,Delayed oculomotor response associates with optic neuritis in youth with demyelinating disorders.,"Impairment in visual and cognitive functions occur in youth with demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease. Quantitative behavioral assessment using eye-tracking and pupillometry can provide functional metrics for important prognostic and clinically relevant information at the bedside.Children and adolescents diagnosed with demyelinating disorders and healthy, age-matched controls completed an interleaved pro- and anti-saccade task using video-based eye-tracking and underwent spectral-domain optical coherence tomography examination for evaluation of retinal nerve fiber layer and ganglion cell inner plexiform layer thickness. Low-contrast visual acuity and Symbol Digit Modalities Test were performed for visual and cognitive functional assessments. We assessed saccade and pupil parameters including saccade reaction time, direction error rate, pupil response latency, peak constriction time, and peak constriction and dilation velocities. Generalized Estimating Equations were used to examine the association of eye-tracking parameters with optic neuritis history, structural metrics, and visual and cognitive scores.The study included 36 demyelinating disorders patients, aged 8-18 yrs. (75% F; median = 15.22 yrs., SD = 2.8) and 34 age-matched controls (65% F; median = 15.26 yrs., SD = 2.3). Surprisingly, pro- and anti-saccade performance was comparable between patients and controls, whereas pupil control was altered in patients. Oculomotor latency measures were strongly associated with the number of optic neuritis episodes, including saccade reaction time, pupil response latency, and peak constriction time. Peak constriction time was associated with both retinal nerve fiber layer and ganglion cell inner plexiform layer thickness. Pupil response latency and peak constriction time were associated with visual acuity. Pupil velocity for both constriction and dilation was associated with Symbol Digit Modalities Test scores.The strong associations between oculomotor measures with history of optic neuritis, structural, visual, and cognitive assessments in these cohorts demonstrates that quantitative eye-tracking can be useful for probing demyelinating injury of the brain and optic nerve.

Demographic and clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, predisposing causes and outcomes of the patients included in the study were recorded in the data form. Severity of liver disease was assessed by Child Pugh Score (CPS), End-stage liver disease model (MELD), MELD-Na and MELD-Lactate scores.Two hundred fifty-four patients diagnosed with HE were included in the study. 59.1% of the patients were male. The mean age of the patients was 65.2 ± 12.6 years. The mortality rate of the patients was 47.2%. When the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, which determines the predictive properties of laboratory parameters and disease severity scores, was examined, the area under curve value of the MELD-Lactate score (0.858 95% CI 0.812-0.904, P  < 0.001) was the highest. Binary logistic regression analysis for the estimation of patients' 30-day mortality showed that CPS and MELD-Lactate scores and blood ammonia and B-type natriuretic peptide levels were independent predictors of mortality.According to the study data, MELD-Lactate and BNP levels in patients diagnosed with HE in the ED may help the clinician in the prediction of 30-day mortality in the early period.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,natriuretic,,2

Here, we investigated the diagnostic utility of lncRNA H19 and miRNA-675-5p in IBD.This study included 97 participants, thirty-five ulcerative colitis patients, thirty-two Crohn's disease patients, and thirty IBD-free controls. History, staging, laboratory investigations, and colonoscopy were performed. Also, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) for revealing of lncRNA H19 and miRNA-675-5p was done.The estimated serum levels for H19 and miRNA-675-5p in the UC and CD groups in comparison to the control group showed a high statistical difference (P = 0.0001 for each parameter). Based upon the severity of UC patients, both biomarkers showed significantly higher values between remission and moderate cases, with p-values 0.022 and 0.02, respectively. Meanwhile, in CD patients, both biomarkers revealed no statistical significance between remission and any active stage of the disease. Additionally, ROC analysis revealed that H19 could discriminate between UC and control subjects with 94.3% sensitivity and 90.0% specificity, and with 87.5% sensitivity, and 88.5% specificity in the CD group. Furthermore, miR-675-5p was able to discriminate between UC and control subjects with 85.7% sensitivity and 97.3% specificity and with 88.4% sensitivity, 95.2% specificity in the CD group. Logistic regression found a significant predictive utility of using miR-675-5p and H19 in IBD.H19 and miRNA-675-5p can be used as diagnostic biomarkers in IBD, with superiority in UC patients with moderate activity.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,diagnostic,,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",2

The pathogenesis of IBD is still not fully clarified. Currently, several studies have reported that circadian abnormality has profound effects on the immune system and intestinal microflora. Meanwhile, it is widely accepted that immune function and intestinal microbiota are two major factors in the pathogenesis of IBD. However, the role of the circadian rhythm in relation to IBD is relatively less understood and largely unexplored.

2023-11-10,37788725,Polyphenol and glucosinolate-derived AhR modulators regulate GPR15 expression on human CD4+ T cells.,"Diets high in fruit and vegetables are perceived to be beneficial for intestinal homeostasis, in health as well as in the context of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Recent breakthroughs in the field of immunology have highlighted the importance of the ligand-activated transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) as a critical regulator of mucosal immunity, including the intestinal trafficking of CD4+ helper T cells, an immune cell subset implicated in a wide range of homeostatic and pathogenic processes. Specifically, the AhR has been shown to directly regulate the expression of the chemoattractant receptor G Protein-Coupled Receptor 15 (GPR15) on CD4+ T cells. GPR15 is an important gut homing marker whose expression on CD4+ T cells in the peripheral circulation is elevated in patients suffering from ulcerative colitis, raising the possibility that, in this setting, the beneficial effect of a diet rich in fruits and vegetables may be mediated through the modulation of GPR15 expression. To address this, we screened physiologically-relevant polyphenol and glucosinolate metabolites for their ability to affect both AhR activity and GPR15 expression. Our complementary approach and associated findings suggest that polyphenol and glucosinolate metabolites can regulate GPR15 expression on human CD4+ T cells in an AhR-dependent manner.",no,yes,no,in vitro,biomarker,,ulcerative colitis,2

Metabolic disturbances can be associated with natriuretic peptides' levels. The study aimed to assess serum N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level in women with depressive symptoms and its relationship with metabolic disturbances.The analysis included 347 women (20-60 years old) from Bialystok PLUS cohort study: 98 with depressive symptoms and 249 controls. Clinical examination, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and assessment of lipid, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and NT-proBNP concentrations in the blood were performed. The participants completed Beck Depression Inventory questionnaire.Metabolic syndrome was more frequent in the group of women with depressive symptoms compared to women without depressive symptoms. Women with depressive symptoms had lower NT-proBNP level than the control group - 45.88 (27.80-67.04) vs 56.49 (32.42-94.25) pg/mL, p = 0.027. Multiple linear regression analysis of all women showed that NT-proBNP level was reversely associated with the presence of depressive symptoms, waist circumference and heart rate and positively connected with age. In the group of women with depressive symptoms, we observed negative correlations between NT-proBNP level and insulin concentration at 60 min of OGTT, diastolic blood pressure and a positive correlation with SHBG.NT-proBNP level is decreased in women with depressive symptoms, which might be connected with metabolic disturbances in this group.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,natriuretic,,2

A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to investigate the association between vitamin D levels and ulcerative colitis.We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang and China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP) from inception to December 2022. We included case-control studies comparing the differences in vitamin D levels between patients with ulcerative colitis and healthy populations. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager5.4, Stata17.0 and other software.Sixteen eligible observational studies were selected from 473 articles involving 2234 subjects, and they included 987 patients with ulcerative colitis and 1247 controls. The results showed that the serum level of vitamin D in patients with ulcerative colitis was significantly lower than that in healthy controls (SMD = -0.83, 95% CI: -1.18, -0.48). Vitamin D deficiency was reported in five studies. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was significantly higher in the ulcerative colitis group than in the healthy control group (OR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.38, 2.62).Serum vitamin D levels were significantly lower in patients with ulcerative colitis than in healthy controls.",no,yes,yes,human non-RCT,biomarker,,ulcerative colitis,2

Genetic variants in the gene encoding complement factor H (CFH) have been identified as an AMD susceptibility gene, however, the mechanistic link is debated. Here, we investigated the link between the CFH Y402H genotype and low-grade inflammation. We recruited 153 healthy individuals, 84 participants with dry stages of AMD, and 148 participants with neovascular AMD. All participants were subjected to detailed retinal examination, and interview regarding comorbidities and lifestyle. Blood samples were analyzed for level of C-Reactive Protein (CRP), white blood cell differential count, and stained with fluorescent antibodies to differentiate CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. CFH Y402H genotyping was performed using an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction genotyping assay. Splenocytes from young and aged wild type and Cfh null mutant C57BL/6J mice were examined for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Healthy individuals with the CFH Y402H at-risk polymorphism HH had higher levels of CRP and lower proportions of CD4+ T cells compared to persons with the YH or YY polymorphism (P = 0.037, Chi-square). Healthy individuals with the HH polymorphism displayed lower proportions of CD4+ T cells with ageing (P < 0.01, one-way ANOVA), whereas both young and aged Cfh null mutant mice displayed lower proportions of CD4+ T cells (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05; unpaired t test). Participants with dry AMD and the HH polymorphism had similarly lower proportions of CD4+ T cells (P = 0.024, one-way ANOVA), but no difference in CRP-levels. In the neovascular stage of AMD, there was no difference in proportion of CD4+ cells or CRP levels according to genotype. The risk-associated CFH genotype is associated with an age-related decrease in proportion of CD4+ T cells and increased levels of CRP in healthy individuals. This indicates that decreased complement regulation results in extensive changes in innate and adaptive immune compartments that precede development of AMD.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinal disease,2
2023-11-10,37940667,Inflammatory bowel disease biomarkers revealed by the human gut microbiome network.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are complex medical conditions in which the gut microbiota is attacked by the immune system of genetically predisposed subjects when exposed to yet unclear environmental factors. The complexity of this class of diseases makes them suitable to be represented and studied with network science. In this paper, the metagenomic data of control, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis subjects' gut microbiota were investigated by representing this data as correlation networks and co-expression networks. We obtained correlation networks by calculating Pearson's correlation between gene expression across subjects. A percolation-based procedure was used to threshold and binarize the adjacency matrices. In contrast, co-expression networks involved the construction of the bipartite subjects-genes networks and the monopartite genes-genes projection after binarization of the biadjacency matrix. Centrality measures and community detection were used on the so-built networks to mine data complexity and highlight possible biomarkers of the diseases. The main results were about the modules of Bacteroides, which were connected in the control subjects' correlation network, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, where co-enzyme A became central in IBD correlation networks and Escherichia coli, whose module has different patterns of integration within the whole network in the different diagnoses.",no,yes,no,other,biomarker,,"crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis",2

Previous neuroimaging studies reported that AMD were accompanied by abnormalities of the brain. However, whether AMD patients were associated with functional connectivity strength (FCS) or not remains unknown. In our study, the purpose of the study was to assess FCS changes in AMD patients.In our study, 20 AMD patients and 20 healthy controls (HCs), matched closely by sex, age, and educational level were underwent MRI scanning. FCS method and seed-based functional connectivity (FC) method were applied to investigate the functional network changes between two groups. Moreover, support vector machine (SVM) method was applied to assess the FCS maps as a feature to classification of AMD diseases.Our study reported that AMD patients showed decreased FCS values in the bilateral calcarine, left supplementary motor area, left superior parietal lobule and left paracentral lobule (ParaL) relative to the HC group. Meanwhile, our study found that the AMD patients showed abnormal FC within visual network, sensorimotor network and default mode network. Moreover, the SVM method showed that FCS maps as machine learning features shows good classification efficiency (area under curve = 0.82) in the study.Our study demonstrated that AMD patients showed abnormal FCS with the visual network, sensorimotor network and default mode network, which might reflect the impaired vision, cognition and motor function in AMD patients.

We developed ERGAssist, an automated approach, to perform non-subjective and repeatable feature identification (""marking"") of the ERG waveform.The automated approach denoised the recorded waveforms and then located the b-wave after applying a lowpass filter. If an a-wave was present, the lowpass filter wave was also used to help locate the a-wave, which was considered the initial large negative response after the flash stimuli. Oscillatory potentials (OPs) were found using a bandpass filter on the denoised waveform. We used two cohorts. One was a Coherence cohort that consisted of ERGs with eight dark-adapted and three light-adapted stimuli in Brown Norway rats (-6 to 1.5 log cd·s/m2). The Verification cohort consisted of control and diabetic (DM) Long Evans rats. We examined retinal function using a five-step dark-adapted protocol (-3 to 1.9 log cd·s/m2).ERGAssist showed a strong correlation with manual markings of ERG features in our Coherence dataset, including the amplitudes (a-wave: r2 = 0.99; b-wave: r2 = 0.99; OP: r2 = 0.92) and implicit times (a-wave: r2 = 0.96; b-wave: r2 = 0.90; OP: r2 = 0.96). In the Verification cohort, both approaches detected differences between control and DM animals and found longer OP implicit times (P < 0.0001) in DM animals.These results provide verification of ERGAssist to identify features of the full-field ERG.This ERG analysis approach can increase the rigor of basic science studies designed to investigate retinal function using full-field ERG.

On optical coherence tomography (OCT), some hyporeflective spaces arise through vascular permeability (exudation) and others arise through degeneration (transudation). Herein we determined whether the histological appearance of fluid manifested this heterogeneity.Two eyes of a White woman in her 90s with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treated bilateral type 3 neovascularization secondary to age-related macular degeneration were osmicated, prepared for submicrometer epoxy resin sections, and correlated to eye-tracked spectral domain OCT. Examples of intraretinal tissue fluid were sought among similarly prepared donor eyes with fibrovascular scars, in a web-based age-related macular degeneration histopathology resource. Fluid stain intensity was quantified in reference to Bruch's membrane and the empty glass slide.Exudative fluid by OCT was slightly reflective and dynamically responded to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor. On histology, this fluid stained moderately, possessed a smooth and homogenous texture, and contained blood cells and fibrin. Nonexudative fluid in degenerative cysts and in outer retinal tubulation was minimally reflective on OCT and did not respond to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor. By histology, this fluid stained lightly, possessed a finely granular texture, and contained mainly tissue debris. Quantification supported the qualitative impressions of fluid stain density. Cells containing retinal pigment epithelium organelles localized to both fluid types.High-resolution histology of osmicated tissue can distinguish between exudative and nonexudative fluid, some of which is transudative.OCT and histological features of different fluid types can inform clinical decision-making and assist in the interpretation of newly available automated fluid detection algorithms.",no,yes,no,other,"diagnostic, biomarker",,retinal disease,2

However, fast and reliable diagnosis of VRL in patients presenting with intermediate or posterior non-infectious uveitis remains a challenge. A proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) and B-cell activating factor (BAFF) are vital factors in the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and prognosis of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and systemic autoimmune diseases. However, their utility as biomarkers for the diagnosis of VRL and uveitis remains unclear.In this retrospective study, we analyzed APRIL and BAFF levels in the aqueous humor (AH) of 43 eyes of 40 patients, including 23 eyes of 20 patients with VRL, eight eyes of eight patients with uveitis, and 12 eyes of 12 patients with other ocular diseases (OODs). Additionally, we measured their levels after induction of chemotherapy in five eyes of five patients with VRL.AH levels of APRIL reliably distinguished VRL from uveitis, with a specificity of 78.3% and sensitivity of 75%. BAFF also showed similar potential. Serial AH analysis of patients with VRL during chemotherapy demonstrated a corresponding decline in AH levels of APRIL and BAFF.This study extends the spectrum of valuable diagnostic biomarkers for VRL and uveitis. In patients with uveitis, the assessment of AH APRIL may help accelerate the diagnosis of VRL. Moreover, our results underline the important role of APRIL and BAFF in therapeutic monitoring of VRL.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"diagnostic, biomarker",,retinopathy,2

We assessed the ability of video capsule endoscopy [VCE] to detect luminal inflammation in patients with IPF.We studied consecutive adults [>17 years] with IPF who were evaluated by VCE after a negative ileocolonoscopy and abdominal enterography between 2013 and 2022. We defined luminal CD by VCE as diffuse erythema, three or more aphthous ulcers, or a Lewis score greater than 135. We compared rates of intestinal inflammation in this cohort with age- and sex-matched controls without perianal fistulas, who underwent VCE for other indications. We excluded persons with pre-existing inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] and exposure to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or immunosuppressive treatments.A total of 45 patients with IPF underwent VCE without complications. Twelve patients [26%] met our definition of luminal CD. Luminal CD was more common in patients with IPF than in controls [26% vs 3%; p <0.01]. Among patients with IPF, male sex (OR [odds ratio], 9.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.1-79.4]), smoking (OR, 4.5; 95% CI [0.9-21.2]), abscess (OR, 6.3; 95% CI [1.5-26.8]), rectal enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] (OR, 9.0; 95% CI [0.8-99.3]), and positive antimicrobial serology (OR, 7.1; 95% CI, [0.7-70.0]) were more common in those with a positive VCE study.VCE detected small intestinal inflammation suggestive of luminal CD in approximately one-quarter of patients with IPF.

Prompt subtype diagnosis enables the correct treatment to be administered. Using genomic data, we aimed to assess machine learning [ML] to classify patients according to IBD subtype.Whole exome sequencing [WES] from paediatric/adult IBD patients was processed using an in-house bioinformatics pipeline. These data were condensed into the per-gene, per-individual genomic burden score, GenePy. Data were split into training and testing datasets [80/20]. Feature selection with a linear support vector classifier, and hyperparameter tuning with Bayesian Optimisation, were performed [training data]. The supervised ML method random forest was utilised to classify patients as CD or UC, using three panels: 1] all available genes; 2] autoimmune genes; 3] 'IBD' genes. ML results were assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristics curve [AUROC], sensitivity, and specificity on the testing dataset.A total of 906 patients were included in analysis [600 CD, 306 UC]. Training data included 488 patients, balanced according to the minority class of UC. The autoimmune gene panel generated the best performing ML model [AUROC = 0.68], outperforming an IBD gene panel [AUROC = 0.61]. NOD2 was the top gene for discriminating CD and UC, regardless of the gene panel used. Lack of variation in genes with high GenePy scores in CD patients was the best classifier of a diagnosis of UC.We demonstrate promising classification of patients by subtype using random forest and WES data. Focusing on specific subgroups of patients, with larger datasets, may result in better classification.",no,yes,no,other,diagnostic,,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",2
2023-11-13,37208498,"Defining Biological Remission in Crohn's Disease: Interest, Challenges and Future Directions.","In Crohn's disease, the treat-to-target strategy has been greatly encouraged and has become a standard of care. In this context, defining the target [remission] constitutes a major stake and is fuelling the literature. Currently, clinical remission [symptom control] is no longer the only objective of treatments since it does not allow to closely control inflammation-induced tissue damage. The introduction of endoscopic remission as a therapeutic target clearly represented progress but this examination remains invasive, costly, not well accepted by patients and does not allow tight control of disease activity. More fundamentally, morphological techniques [e.g. endoscopy, histology, ultrasonography] are limited since they do not evaluate the biological activity of the disease but only its consequences. Besides, emerging evidence suggests that biological signs of disease activity could better guide treatment decisions than clinical parameters. In this context, we stress the necessity to define a novel treatment target: biological remission. Based on our previous work, we propose a conceptual definition of biological remission which goes beyond the classical normalization of inflammatory markers [C-reactive protein and faecal calprotectin]: absence of biological signs associated with the risk of short-term relapse and mid-/long-term relapse. The risk of short-term relapse seems essentially to be characterized by a persistent inflammatory state while the risk of mid-/long-term relapse implies a more heterogeneous biology. We discuss the value of our proposal [guiding treatment maintenance, escalation or de-escalation] but also the fact that its clinical implementation would require overcoming major challenges. Finally, future directions are proposed to better define biological remission.",no,yes,no,other,biomarker,,crohn's disease,2

We investigated sudomotor dysfunction in a large group of participants with diabetes, prediabetes, and nondiabetic healthy subjects. This study aimed to complete knowledge on sudomotor dysfunction in this population, especially regarding the threshold values for the electrochemical skin conductance (ESC) and factors affecting it.A total of 690 volunteers in four groups were included in the study (type 1 [T1DG]: n = 80, 61.3% women; type 2 diabetes [T2DG]: n = 438, 63.5% women; prediabetes [Pre-DG]: n = 88, 80.7% women; healthy control [HC-G]: n = 84, 67.5% women). All subjects were investigated for clinical diabetic peripheral polyneuropathy and sudomotor dysfunction. The characteristics of participants obtained from outpatient records were evaluated. We used the Sudoscan device to measure ESC which was normalized for BMI, to improve the discriminative capability of the method.Diabetic polyneuropathy was found in 17.5% of T1DG, 27.4% of T1DG, and 10.2% of Pre-DG. The mean ESC/BMI was lower in subgroups with diabetic polyneuropathy than those without. Mean ESC/BMI was lowest in T2DG and highest in HC-G but comparable in T1DG and Pre-DG. We accepted the ""mean ESC/BMI-1 SD"" in the HC-G as the threshold for sudomotor dysfunction. Accordingly, the prevalence of sudomotor dysfunction was 18.8%, 44.3%, 59.1%, and 15% in T1DG, T2DG, Pre-DG, and HC-G, respectively. In T2DG, sudomotor dysfunction was found in 66.7% of persons with retinopathy, of which 56.3% had clinical diabetic polyneuropathy. The prevalence of sudomotor dysfunction in subjects with peripheral artery disease, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension was 46.7%, 47.4%, 43.4%, and 50%, respectively, and 42.9%, 38.9%, 45.5%, and 37.3% of whom in the same order detected with clinical diabetic polyneuropathy. Considering the entire group, a logistic regression model demonstrated that the variables associated with SMD were: retinopathy (OR: 2.969; 95% CI: 1.723, 5.114), female gender (OR: 1.952; 95% CI: 1.287, 2.962), and e-GFR (OR: 0.989; 95% CI: 0.981, 0.998). Since the rate of complications was very low in T1DG, excluding this group, a new model similarly revealed that retinopathy and female gender were associated with SMD, however, the association with e-GFR was disappeared.The prevalence of sudomotor dysfunction is high when established peripheral polyneuropathy was present in diabetes. Even though, sudomotor dysfunction can also occur before clinical polyneuropathy in both types of diabetes (T1DG: 18.8%, T2DG 44.3%), prediabetes (59.1%), and nondiabetic healthy subjects (15%). The variables associated with sudomotor dysfunction were retinopathy and female sex. Normalization of ESC for BMI would be a beneficial approach. However, before this method is included in the routine screening programs for diabetic polyneuropathy, large-scale and prospective studies are required to reach a consensus on the pathological threshold values.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinopathy,2
2023-11-13,37409973,The Hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical Response to Critical Illness: A Concept in Need of Revision.,"Based on insights obtained during the past decade, the classical concept of an activated hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical axis in response to critical illness is in need of revision. After a brief central hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical axis activation, the vital maintenance of increased systemic cortisol availability and action in response to critical illness is predominantly driven by peripheral adaptations rather than by an ongoing centrally activated several-fold increased production and secretion of cortisol. Besides the known reduction of cortisol-binding proteins that increases free cortisol, these peripheral responses comprise suppressed cortisol metabolism in liver and kidney, prolonging cortisol half-life, and local alterations in expression of 11βHSD1, glucocorticoid receptor-α (GRα), and FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP51) that appear to titrate increased GRα action in vital organs and tissues while reducing GRα action in neutrophils, possibly preventing immune-suppressive off-target effects of increased systemic cortisol availability. Peripherally increased cortisol exerts negative feed-back inhibition at the pituitary level impairing processing of pro-opiomelanocortin into ACTH, thereby reducing ACTH-driven cortisol secretion, whereas ongoing central activation results in increased circulating pro-opiomelanocortin. These alterations seem adaptive and beneficial for the host in the short term. However, as a consequence, patients with prolonged critical illness who require intensive care for weeks or longer may develop a form of central adrenal insufficiency. The new findings supersede earlier concepts such as ""relative,"" as opposed to ""absolute,"" adrenal insufficiency and generalized systemic glucocorticoid resistance in the critically ill. The findings also question the scientific basis for broad implementation of stress dose hydrocortisone treatment of patients suffering from acute septic shock solely based on assumption of cortisol insufficiency.",yes,no,no,other,biomarker,melanocortin,,2

Diagnostic performance of AoO was evaluated.We describe the body mass index trajectories of 62 children with genetic obesity (29 nonsyndromic, 33 syndromic) and 298 controls. Median AoO was 1.2 years in nonsyndromic genetic obesity (0.4 and 0.6 years in biallelic LEPR and MC4R; 1.7 in heterozygous MC4R); 2.0 years in syndromic genetic obesity (0.9, 2.3, 4.3, and 6.8 years in pseudohypoparathyroidism, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, 16p11.2del syndrome, and Temple syndrome, respectively); and 3.8 years in controls. The optimal AoO cut-off was ≤3.9 years (sensitivity, 0.83; specificity, 0.49; area under the curve, 0.79; P < .001) for nonsyndromic and ≤4.7 years (sensitivity, 0.82; specificity, 0.37; area under the curve, 0.68; P = .001) for syndromic genetic obesity.Optimal AoO cut-off as single parameter to determine which children should undergo genetic testing was ≤3.9 years.

The images were split into training (n = 1340), validation (n = 167), and test (n = 165) datasets. Two state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms based on either object-level detection or image-level classification were trained on the dataset. These models were compared to one another and against 2 independent glaucoma specialists. We evaluated model performance by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). AUCs were compared with the Hanley-McNeil method.The object detection model achieved an AUC of 0.936 (95% CI = 0.857-0.964) across all held-out images (n = 165 photographs), which was significantly superior to the image classification model (AUC = 0.845, 95% CI = 0.740-0.912; P = .006). At an operating point selected for high specificity, the model achieved a specificity of 94.3% and a sensitivity of 70.0%, which was statistically indistinguishable from an expert clinician (P = .7). At an operating point selected for high sensitivity, the model achieves a sensitivity of 96.7% and a specificity of 73.3%.An autonomous object detection model is superior to an image classification model for detecting disc hemorrhages, and performed comparably to 2 clinicians.",no,yes,no,other,diagnostic,,retinal disease,2

Identification of high-risk individuals via risk stratification and screening at sub-clinical stages, which may be offered by ocular screening, is important to prevent major adverse cardiac events. Retinal microvasculature has been widely researched for potential application in both diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk prediction. However, the conjunctival microvasculature as a tool for cardiovascular disease risk prediction remains largely unexplored. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the current cardiovascular risk assessment methods, identifying gaps in the literature that imaging of the ocular microcirculation may have the potential to fill. This review also explores the themes of machine learning, risk scores, biomarkers, medical imaging, and clinical risk factors. Cardiovascular risk classification varies based on the population assessed, the risk factors included, and the assessment methods.

The amplitudes and peak time of the ffERG responses were obtained from children divided into 6- to 8-year-old and 9- to 12-year-old groups. Using a skin electrode, electrical signals were measured in response to white stimulating light and white background light (LA 3 ERG). A blue background light and red flashes were then used to elicit the PhNR.The a-wave amplitude ranged from 0.40 to 9.20 μV, the b-wave ranged from 4.70 to 30.80 μV, and the PhNR ranged from 1.30 to 39.90 μV. The b-wave peak time (33.20 ms) of 6- to 8-year-old groups was slightly shorter than that of the 9- to 12-year-old groups (33.60 ms, P = 0.01), but no differences in amplitudes or in peak time of other components.

Ten participants with varying experience in SGUS contributed to the reliability exercise. Thirty SGUS images of the submandibular and parotid gland with abnormalities ranging from 0 to 3 were scored using the written definitions of the OMERACT SGUS scoring system and using the SGUS atlas based on the OMERACT scoring system. For intra-reader reliability, two rounds were performed without and with the atlas-in the 2nd round the 30 images were rearranged in random order by a physician not included in the scoring. Inter-reader reliability was also determined in both rounds. Without using the atlas, the SGUS OMERACT scoring system showed fair inter-reader reliability in round 1 (mean kappa 0.36; range 0.06-0.69) and moderate intra-reader reliability (mean kappa 0.55; range 0.28-0.81). With the atlas, inter-reader reliability improved in round 1 to moderate (mean kappa 0.52; range 0.31-0.77) and intra-reader reliability to good (mean kappa 0.69; range 0.46-0.86). Higher intra-reader reliability was noted in participants with previous SGUS experience. The SGUS atlas increased both intra- and inter-reader reliability for scoring gland pathology in participants with varying SGUS experience suggesting a possible future role in clinical practice and trials.

Rare forms of obesity are mostly monogenic, and less frequently due to polygenic influence. Polygenic form of obesity is usually the common obesity with single gene variations exerting smaller impact on weight and is commonly non-syndromic.Non-syndromic monogenic obesity is associated with variants in single genes typically related to the hypothalamic leptin-melanocortin signalling pathway, which plays a key role in hunger and satiety regulation, thus body weight control. Patients with these genetic defects usually present with hyperphagia and early-onset severe obesity. Significant progress in genetic diagnostic testing has recently made for early identification of patients with genetic obesity, which guarantees prompt intervention in terms of therapeutic management of the disease. What is Known: • Obesity represents a major health problem among children and adolescents, with an increasing prevalence worldwide, associated with cardiovascular disease and metabolic abnormalities, and it can be due to both genetic and environmental factors. • Non-syndromic monogenic obesity is linked to modifications in single genes usually involved in the hypothalamic leptin-melanocortin signalling pathway, which plays a key role in hunger and satiety regulation. What is New: • The increasing understanding of rare forms of monogenic obesity has provided significant insights into the genetic causes of pediatric obesity, and our current knowledge of the various genes associated with childhood obesity is rapidly expanding. • A useful diagnostic algorithm for early identification of genetic obesity has been proposed, which can ensure a prompt intervention in terms of therapeutic management of the disease and an early prevention of the development of associated metabolic conditions.",yes,no,no,not a study,biomarker,melanocortin,,2

To identify modules and metabolites linked to DR, pathway analysis was performed using WGCNA, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Small-Molecule Pathway Database. The association of sarcosine with DR was estimated by restricted cubic spline and conditional logistic regression models. Its joint effects with covariates on DR were also extensively examined.With per interquartile range elevation of sarcosine, the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of DR significantly decreased by 67% (AOR: 0.33, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.19-0.58). Similar results were also found in the tertile analysis. Compared with those in the first tertile of sarcosine, the AOR significantly decreased by 54% (AOR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.18-1.17) and 78% (AOR: 0.22, 95% CI: 0.08-0.59) for subjects in the second and third tertiles, respectively. Compared with subjects with lower sarcosine and lower HDL-C levels, those with higher sarcosine and lower HDL-C levels had the lowest odds of DR (OR: 0.13, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.43).Serum sarcosine was inversely related to DR, especially in T2D patients with insufficient HDL-C.

After pars plana vitrectomy, the macular hole was successfully closed without aggravation of uveitis.In this case, a pathogenic variant of CAPN5 lead to a distinct phenotype of retinitis pigmentosa, posterior uveitis, vitreomacular traction, and macular hole without typical inflammatory neovascularization or tractional membranes. Therefore, the clinical variability of CAPN5-NIV and genetic diagnosis should be considered in cases of atypical retinitis pigmentosa with bilateral macular hole.",no,yes,no,other,diagnostic,,retinal disease,2

We hypothesized that polymorphisms in IRS1, IRS2, MC3R, and MC4R influence metabolic and inflammatory markers and food intake composition in Brazilian subjects. This exploratory pilot study included 358 adult subjects. Clinical, anthropometric, and laboratory data were obtained through interview and access to medical records. The variants IRS1 rs2943634 A˃C, IRS2 rs1865434 C>T, MC3R rs3746619 C>A, and MC4R rs17782313 T>C were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Food intake composition was assessed in a group of subjects with obesity (n = 84) before and after a short-term nutritional counseling program (9 weeks). MC4R rs17782313 was associated with increased risk of obesity (P = .034). Multivariate linear regression analysis adjusted by covariates indicated associations of IRS2 rs1865434 with reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and resistin, MC3R rs3746619 with high glycated hemoglobin, and IRS1 rs2943634 and MC4R rs17782313 with increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (P < .05). Energy intake and carbohydrate and total fat intakes were reduced after the diet-oriented program (P < .05). Multivariate linear regression analysis showed associations of IRS2 rs1865434 with high basal fiber intake, IRS1 rs2943634 with low postprogram carbohydrate intake, and MC4R rs17782313 with low postprogram total fat and saturated fatty acid intakes (P < .05). Although significant associations did not survive correction for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg method in this exploratory study, polymorphisms in IRS1, IRS2, MC3R, and MC4R influence metabolic and inflammatory status in Brazilian adults.

2023-11-13,37716905,Total recall: the role of PIDDosome components in neurodegeneration.,"The PIDDosome is a multiprotein complex that includes p53-induced protein with a death domain 1 (PIDD1), receptor-interacting protein-associated ICH-1/CED-3 homologous protein with a death domain (RAIDD), and caspase-2, the activation of which is driven by PIDDosome assembly. In addition to the key role of the PIDDosome in the regulation of cell differentiation, tissue homeostasis, and organogenesis and regeneration, caspase-2, RAIDD and PIDD1 engagement in neuronal development was shown. Here, we focus on the involvement of PIDDosome components in neurodegenerative disorders, including retinal neuropathies, different types of brain damage, and Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Lewy body disease.

2023-11-13,37734426,A correlation between oxidative stress and diabetic retinopathy: An updated review.,"Oxidative stress (OS) is a cytopathic outcome of excessively generated reactive oxygen species (ROS), down regulated antioxidant defense signaling pathways, and the imbalance between the produced radicals and their clearance. It plays a role in the genesis of several illnesses, especially hyperglycemia and its effects. Diabetic retinal illness, a micro vascular side effect of the condition, is the prime reason of diabetic related blindness. The OS (directly or indirectly) is associated with diabetic retinopathy (DR) and related consequences. The OS is responsible to induce and interfere the metabolic signaling pathways to enhance influx of the polyol cascades and hexosamine pathways, stimulate Protein Kinase-C (PKC) variants, and accumulate advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Additionally, the inequity between the scavenging and generation of ROS is caused by the epigenetic alteration caused by hyperglycemia that suppresses the antioxidant defense system. Induced by an excessive buildup of ROS, retinal changes in structure and function include mitochondrial damage, cellular death, inflammation, and lipid peroxidation. Therefore, it is crucial to comprehend and clarify the mechanisms connected to oxidative stress that underlie the development of DR.",no,yes,no,not a study,biomarker,,retinopathy,2
2023-11-13,37755549,Clinical significance of the expression levels of serum transforming growth factor-β and CXC type chemokine ligand 13 in primary Sjogren's syndrome patients.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the expression levels of the serum transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) CXC type chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13) in primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) patients and its correlation with disease severity.Thirty patients with pSS admitted to Nanjing Traditional Chinese Medicine Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine from January 2021 to December 2022 were included as the pSS group, while 30 patients who underwent physical examination during the same period were included as the control group. The levels of TGF-β1 and CXCL13 were detected. The diagnostic value of TGF-β1 and CXCL13 for pSS was analyzed. Detection of serum TGF-β1 and CXCL13 levels in pSS patients with different disease activities and lip gland pathological grading of pSS was done. We compared the correlation between TGF-β1 and CXCL13 levels and disease activity and labial gland pathological grading in pSS patients.The TGF-β1 and CXCL13 levels in the pSS group were higher than those in the control group. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for TGF-β1 and CXCL13 diagnosis of pSS was 0.790 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.720~0.861) and 0.838 (95% CI: 0.778~0.898), respectively. The serum TGF-β1 and CXCL13 levels of pSS patients significantly increase with the increase of disease activity and lip gland pathological grading. The TGF-β1 and CXCL13 levels in pSS patients were positively correlated with disease activity and lip gland pathological grading.The levels of TGF-β1 and CXCL13 in pSS patients were increased, and it was closely related to disease activity and lip gland pathological grading, which can be used as an effective indicator for the diagnosis of pSS. Key Points • The TGF-β1 and CXCL13 levels in the pSS group were higher than those in the control group. • The TGF-β1 and CXCL13 levels in pSS patients were positively correlated with disease activity and lip gland pathological grading. • TGF-β1 and CXCL13 can be used as an effective indicator for the diagnosis of pSS.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"diagnostic, biomarker",,dry eye,2
2023-11-13,37758065,Local modulation of thyroid hormone signaling in the retina affects the development of diabetic retinopathy.,"Thyroid hormone (TH) dyshomeostasis is associated with poor prognosis in acute and prolonged illness, but its role in diabetic retinopathy (DR) has never been investigated. Here, we characterized the TH system in the retinas of db/db mice and highlighted regulatory processes in MIO-M1 cells. In the db/db retinas, typical functional traits and molecular signatures of DR were paralleled by a tissue-restricted reduction of TH levels. A local condition of low T3 (LT3S) was also demonstrated, which was likely to be induced by deiodinase 3 (DIO3) upregulation, and by decreased expression of DIO2 and of TH receptors. Concurrently, T3-responsive genes, including mitochondrial markers and microRNAs (miR-133-3p, 338-3p and 29c-3p), were downregulated. In MIO-M1 cells, a feedback regulatory circuit was evidenced whereby miR-133-3p triggered the post-transcriptional repression of DIO3 in a T3-dependent manner, while high glucose (HG) led to DIO3 upregulation through a nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2-hypoxia-inducible factor-1 pathway. Finally, an in vitro simulated condition of early LT3S and hyperglycemia correlated with reduced markers of both mitochondrial function and stress response, which was reverted by T3 replacement. Together, the data suggest that, in the early phases of DR, a DIO3-driven LT3S may be protective against retinal stress, while, in the chronic phase, it not only fails to limit HG-induced damage, but also increases cell vulnerability likely due to persistent mitochondrial dysfunction.",no,yes,no,animal,biomarker,,retinopathy,2

Assessments included central macular thickness (CMT) and length of disruption to the ellipsoid zone (EZ) via optical coherence tomography (OCT), electroretinography (ERG) parameters, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and fundus autofluorescence (FAF).At first visit, with a mean age of 30 years (range 5-70 years), 12 patients had a BCVA below Australian driving standard (LogMAR ≥ 0.3 bilaterally), and 1 patient was legally blind (LogMAR ≥ 1). Longitudinal analysis demonstrated a deterioration of LogMAR by - 0.019 per year (p < 0.001). This accompanied a reduction in CMT of - 1.4 µm per year (p < 0.0001), lengthened EZ disruption by 42 µm per year (p =  < 0.0001) and increased area of FAF by 0.05 mm2 per year (p = 0.027). Similarly, cone function decreased with increasing age, as demonstrated by decreasing b-wave amplitude of the light-adapted 30 Hz flicker and fused flicker (p = 0.005 and p = 0.018, respectively). Reduction in CMT and increased EZ disruption on OCT were associated with functional changes including poorer BCVA and decreased cone function on ERG.We have described the natural long-term decline in vision and cone function associated with mutations in GUCY2D and identified a set of functional and structural biomarkers that may be useful as outcome parameters for future therapeutic clinical trials.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinal disease,2

Color fundus photography revealed nummular pigments in the macula and periphery. Imaging studies revealed thickened retina on standard domain optical coherence tomography and widespread atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium on autofluorescence. Full-field electroretinography revealed extinguished scotopic and significantly reduced photopic responses. Genetic testing demonstrated a novel homozygous variant, c.3057 T > A; p.(Tyr1019Ter), in the CRB1 gene. This variant is not currently amenable to base editing, however, in silico analysis revealed several potential prime editing strategies for correction.This case presentation is consistent with LCA8, suggesting pathogenicity of this novel variant and expanding our knowledge of disease-causing CRB1 variants.",no,yes,no,other,"diagnostic, biomarker",,retinal disease,2

This study investigated whether this phenomenon is intrinsic to heart rhythm irregularity and independent of the heart rate and left atrial pressure (LAP) overload. We investigated 46 patients (age: 59 ± 10 years, male gender: 77%) with non-valvular paroxysmal AF who were scheduled for catheter ablation and had documented stable sinus rhythm for at least 18 hours before the procedure. All patients underwent direct measurement of right atrial pressure and LAP, simultaneously with assessment of plasma B-type NP, N-terminal pro-brain NP, and mid-regional pro-atrial NP. The baseline measurement was followed by induction of AF by rapid atrial pacing in the first 24 patients and by regular pacing from the coronary sinus at 100/min (corresponding to the mean heart rate during induced AF) in the latter 22 patients. Hemodynamic assessment and blood sampling were repeated after 20 min of the ongoing AF or fast regular paging. The baseline characteristics and hemodynamic measurements were comparable between study groups; however, patients in the regular atrial pacing group had a higher body mass index and a larger left atrial diameter compared with the induced AF group. Plasma levels of all 3 NPs increased significantly during induced AF but not during fast regular pacing, and the increase of NPs was independent of right atrial pressure and LAP.

However, clinical decision-making may be difficult because symptoms are subjective and cannot be quantitatively assessed and confirmed. This study aimed to evaluate the association between heart failure (HF)-related symptoms and cardiac hemodynamic left ventricular deformations in patients with severe AS using transthoracic echocardiographic assessments of left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV-GLS). The medical records of patients hospitalized for AS between February 2017 and September 2019 were retrospectively screened. Independent cardiologists analyzed the transthoracic echocardiographic images of a digital echocardiography database. The cohort comprised 177 hospitalized patients with severe AS and no history of HF. The subgroup with HF-related symptoms included 87 patients, whereas that without HF-related symptoms included 90 patients. In 145 patients without atrial fibrillation, the left atrial volume index (LAVI) and LV-GLS were significantly associated with HF-related symptoms (odds ratio 1.033, 95% confidence interval 1.008 to 1.059, p = 0.011 and odds ratio 1.224, 95% confidence interval 1.118 to 1.340, p <0.0001, respectively). Moreover, the combination of brain natriuretic peptide level, LAVI, and LV-GLS showed better diagnostic accuracy than the combination of brain natriuretic peptide level and LAVI (p = 0.005). However, there were no such tendencies in 32 patients with atrial fibrillation. The HF-related symptoms in patients with severe AS were strongly linked to LV-GLS.

2023-11-13,37840219,Gpr75 knockout mice display age-dependent cone photoreceptor cell loss.,"GPR75 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor for which there is currently limited information and its function in physiology and disease is only recently beginning to emerge. This orphan receptor is expressed in the retina but its function in the eye is unknown. The earliest studies on GPR75 were conducted in the retina, where the receptor was first identified and cloned and mutations in the receptor were identified as a possible contributor to retinal degenerative disease. Despite these sporadic reports, the function of GPR75 in the retina and in retinal disease has yet to be explored. To assess whether GPR75 has a functional role in the retina, the retina of Gpr75 knockout mice was characterized. Knockout mice displayed a mild progressive retinal degeneration, which was accompanied by oxidative stress. The degeneration was because of the loss of both M-cone and S-cone photoreceptor cells. Housing mice under constant dark conditions reduced oxidative stress but did not prevent cone photoreceptor cell loss, indicating that oxidative stress is not a primary cause of the observed retinal degeneration. Studies here demonstrate an important role for GPR75 in maintaining the health of cone photoreceptor cells and that Gpr75 knockout mice can be used as a model to study cone photoreceptor cell loss.",no,yes,no,animal,biomarker,,retinal disease,2
2023-11-13,37844875,Left Atrial Remodeling Related to Disproportionately Low B-Type Natriuretic Peptide in Acute Heart Failure Patients with Atrial Fibrillation.,"The diagnostic performance of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) for acute heart failure (HF) is impaired in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Increased AF burden in HF is associated with left atrial (LA) remodeling. Recent studies have revealed that LA remodeling may affect LV filling. We hypothesized that LA remodeling affects BNP secretion in acute HF conditions. The study investigated the clinical impact of LA remodeling on admission BNP levels in acute HF patients with and without AF. Consecutive acute HF hospitalized patients (n = 899) were divided into groups with (n = 382) or without AF (n = 507) and subdivided into disproportionately low BNP (LB) (≤200 pg/ml), medium BNP (200 to 600 pg/ml) and high BNP (≥600 pg/ml) subgroups. The AF group had a higher proportion of patients with LB than the non-AF group (23.6% vs 16.6%, p = 0.009). BNP levels in both groups were positively correlated with LV end-diastolic volume and negatively correlated with LV ejection fraction in both groups. In contrast, BNP was positively correlated with LA volume index in the non-AF group, but negatively correlated in the AF group. The survival rates were significantly higher in the LB group than in the other groups in non-AF. Conversely, there were no significant differences across all groups in AF patients. In conclusion, in patients with acute HF and AF, disproportionately low BNP levels are associated with LA structural remodeling and poor prognosis.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,"diagnostic, biomarker",natriuretic,,2

PhNRs were recorded to red flashes (1.5 cd·s·m-2) on a blue background (10 cd·m-2) and to white flashes on a white background (the latter being the ISCEV standard LA 3 stimulus). PhNR results were compared with a reference test battery assessing RGC/optic nerve structure and function including optical coherence tomography (OCT) retinal nerve fibre layer thickness and mean RGC volume measurements, fundus photography, pattern electroretinography and visual evoked potentials. Primary outcome measures were differences in sensitivity and specificity of the two PhNR methods.Two hundred and forty-three participants were initially enrolled, with 200 (median age 54; range 18-95; female 65%) meeting inclusion criteria. Sensitivity was 53% (95% confidence intervals [CI] 39% to 68%) and 62% (95% CI 48% to 76%), for WW and RB PhNRs, respectively. Specificity was 80% (95% CI 74% to 86%) and 78% (95% CI 72% to 85%), respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between sensitivities (p = 0.046) but not specificities (p = 0.08) of the two methods. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) values were 0.73 for WW and 0.74 for RB PhNRs.PhNRs to red flashes on a blue background may be more sensitive than white-on-white stimuli, but there is no significant difference between specificities.

Studies on the association and diagnostic value of NT-proBNP in carotid plaques (CAP) in patients with CHD are limited.The relationships between NT-proBNP and the risk of CAP in different glucose metabolic states, sexes, and age categories were also examined using 5,093 patients diagnosed with CHD. The NT-proBNP tertiles were used to divide patients into three groups in which the NT-proBNP levels, blood glucose levels, the occurrence of CAP, and the number and nature of CAP were measured using normoglycemic (NG), prediabetes (Pre-DM), and diabetes mellitus (DM) glucose metabolic statuses. Logistic regression analyses were used to compare the relationship between NT-proBNP and the risk of CAP occurrence and the number and nature of CAP. The diagnostic value of NT-proBNP for CAP risk was measured using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.We found a 37% relative increase in the correlation between changes in NT-proBNP per standard deviation (SD) and the incidence of CAP. After adjusting for potential confounders, NT-proBNP at the T3 level was found to be associated with an increased CAP odds ratio (OR) when T1 was used as the reference. This relationship was also present in males, patients aged > 60 years, or both pre-DM and DM states. NT-proBNP was more likely to present as hypoechoic plaques at T1 and as mixed plaques at T3. We also measured the diagnostic accuracy of CAP for NT-proBNP in patients with CHD, with an AUC value of 0.627(95% CI 0.592-0.631), sensitivity of 50.7%, and specificity of 68.0%.An increase in NT-proBNP was significantly associated with the risk of CAP in patients with CHD, especially in males and patients aged > 60 years, and exhibited specific characteristics under different glucose metabolism states.

Stereological analysis of the volume density of the secretory tissue, connective tissue, and fat was performed on samples from 66 donors.Up to 69% of all samples showed degenerative changes. Female samples had a higher frequency of all observed degenerative changes, except ductal dilation. While acinar atrophy was significantly more prevalent in women, ductal dilation was significantly more prevalent in men. Stereological analysis indicated lower portions of acini and higher portions of connective tissue and fat, as well as a more pronounced age-related progression of degenerative changes in female samples.Female lacrimal glands are more susceptible to degeneration, and this susceptibility could play an important role in the higher incidence of dry eye disease in older women.

We have developed a deep learning-based age-related macular degeneration (AMD) stage classifier, to efficiently identify the first onset of early/intermediate (iAMD), atrophic (GA), and neovascular (nAMD) stage of AMD in retrospective data. We trained a two-stage convolutional neural network to classify macula-centered 3D volumes from Topcon OCT images into 4 classes: Normal, iAMD, GA and nAMD. In the first stage, a 2D ResNet50 is trained to identify the disease categories on the individual OCT B-scans while in the second stage, four smaller models (ResNets) use the concatenated B-scan-wise output from the first stage to classify the entire OCT volume. Classification uncertainty estimates are generated with Monte-Carlo dropout at inference time.

To solve this empasse it would be beneficial to apply the latest Deep Learning (DL) methods to the Genome Interpretation (GI) problem, similarly to what AlphaFold did for Structural Biology. Unfortunately DL requires large datasets to be viable, and aggregating genomics datasets poses several legal, ethical and infrastructural complications. Federated Learning (FL) is a Machine Learning (ML) paradigm designed to tackle these issues. It allows ML methods to be collaboratively trained and tested on collections of physically separate datasets, without requiring the actual centralization of sensitive data. FL could thus be key to enable DL applications to GI on sufficiently large genomics data. We propose FedCrohn, a FL GI Neural Network model for the exome-based Crohn's Disease risk prediction, providing a proof-of-concept that FL is a viable paradigm to build novel ML GI approaches. We benchmark it in several realistic scenarios, showing that FL can indeed provide performances similar to conventional ML on centralized data, and that collaborating in FL initiatives is likely beneficial for most of the medical centers participating in them.",no,yes,no,other,biomarker,,crohn's disease,2

Using optical coherence tomography angiography, the choroidal neovascular complexes of 27 patients with PNV, 34 patients with nAMD and SIPED, and 15 patients with nAMD without SIPED were analyzed with FIJI and AngioTool software. PNV compared to nAMD with SIPED had a greater vessel percentage area (P = 0.034), junction density (P = 0.045), average vessel length (P < 0.001), and fractal dimension (P < 0.001). PNV, compared to nAMD without SIPED, had a greater total vessel length (P = 0.002), total number of junctions (P < 0.001), junction density (P = 0.034), and fractal dimension (P = 0.005). nAMD with SIPED, compared to nAMD without SIPED, had greater vessel area, total number of junctions, total vessel length, and average vessel length (all P values < 0.001). Patients with nAMD plus SIPED and individuals with nAMD without SIPED have similar fractal dimension values (P = 0.703).

Although previous studies proved oral microbial dysbiosis in IBD patients, the bacterial community in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of those IBD patients combined with oral ulcers has not been profiled yet.In this study, we enrolled four groups of subjects, including healthy controls (CON), oral ulcer patients (OU), and ulcerative colitis patients with (UC_OU) and without (UC) oral ulcers. Bio-samples from three GI niches containing salivary, buccal, and fecal samples, were collected for 16S rRNA V3-V4 region sequencing. Bacterial abundance and related bio-functions were compared, and data showed that the fecal microbiota was more potent than salivary and buccal microbes in shaping the host immune system. ~ 22 UC and 10 UC_OU 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA) routine treated patients were followed-up for six months; according to their treatment response (a decrease in the endoscopic Mayo score), they were further sub-grouped as responding and non-responding patients.We found those UC patients complicated with oral ulcers presented weaker treatment response, and three oral bacterial genera, i.e., Fusobacterium, Oribacterium, and Campylobacter, might be connected with treatment responding. Additionally, the salivary microbiome could be an indicator of treatment responding in 5-ASA routine treatment rather than buccal or fecal ones.The fecal microbiota had a strong effect on the host's immune indices, while the oral bacterial microbiota could help stratification for ulcerative colitis patients with oral ulcers. Additionally, the oral microbiota had the potential role in reflecting the treatment response of UC patients. Three oral bacteria genera (Fusobacterium, Oribacterium, and Campylobacter) might be involved in UC patients with oral ulcers lacking treatment responses, and monitoring oral microbiota may be meaningful in assessing the therapeutic response in UC patients.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,ulcerative colitis,2
2023-11-13,37947657,"Mechanisms Underlying Rare Inherited Pediatric Retinal Vascular Diseases: FEVR, Norrie Disease, Persistent Fetal Vascular Syndrome.","Familial Exudative Vitreoretinopathy (FEVR), Norrie disease, and persistent fetal vascular syndrome (PFVS) are extremely rare retinopathies that are clinically distinct but are unified by abnormal retinal endothelial cell function, and subsequent irregular retinal vascular development and/or aberrant inner blood-retinal-barrier (iBRB) function. The early angiogenesis of the retina and its iBRB is a delicate process that is mediated by the canonical Norrin Wnt-signaling pathway in retinal endothelial cells. Pathogenic variants in genes that play key roles within this pathway, such as NDP, FZD4, TSPAN12, and LRP5, have been associated with the incidence of these retinal diseases. Recent efforts to further elucidate the etiology of these conditions have not only highlighted their multigenic nature but have also resulted in the discovery of pathological variants in additional genes such as CTNNB1, KIF11, and ZNF408, some of which operate outside of the Norrin Wnt-signaling pathway. Recent discoveries of FEVR-linked variants in two other Catenin genes (CTNND1, CTNNA1) and the Endoplasmic Reticulum Membrane Complex Subunit-1 gene (EMC1) suggest that we will continue to find additional genes that impact the neural retinal vasculature, especially in multi-syndromic conditions.

The purpose of this study was to use the results of ophthalmologists as the gold standard to evaluate the accuracy of community general practitioners' judgement and grading of DR to find a feasible and convenient DR screening method to reduce the risk of visual impairment and blindness in known diabetes patients. Retinal images of 1646 diabetic patients who underwent DR screening through teleophthalmology at Nanchang First Hospital were collected for 30 months (January 2020 to June 2022). Retinal images were collected without medication for mydriasis, stored by community general practitioner, and diagnosed by both community general practitioner and ophthalmologist of our hospital through teleophthalmology. The grading of ophthalmologist was used as a reference or gold standard for comparison with that of community general practitioner. A total of 1646 patients and 3185 eyes were examined, including 2310 eyes with DR. The evaluation by the community general practitioner had a Kappa value of 0.578, sensitivity of 80.58%, specificity of 89.94%, and accuracy of 83.38%% in 2020; a Kappa value of 0.685, sensitivity of 95.43%, specificity of 78.55%, and accuracy of 90.77% in 2021; and a Kappa value of 0.744, sensitivity of 93.99%, specificity of 88.97%, and accuracy of 92.86% in 2022. Teleophthalmology helped with large-scale screening of DR and made it possible for community general practitioner to grade images with high accuracy after appropriate training.

2023-11-13,37951857,Diagnosis of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis using the microbiome.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a multifactorial chronic inflammatory disease resulting from dysregulation of the mucosal immune response and gut microbiota. Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are difficult to distinguish, and differential diagnosis is essential for establishing a long-term treatment plan for patients. Furthermore, the abundance of mucosal bacteria is associated with the severity of the disease. This study aimed to differentiate and diagnose these two diseases using the microbiome and identify specific biomarkers associated with disease activity.Differences in the abundance and composition of the microbiome between IBD patients and healthy controls (HC) were observed. Compared to HC, the diversity of the gut microbiome in patients with IBD decreased; the diversity of the gut microbiome in patients with CD was significantly lower. Sixty-eight microbiota members (28 for CD and 40 for UC) associated with these diseases were identified. Additionally, as the disease progressed through different stages, the diversity of the bacteria decreased. The abundances of Alistipes shahii and Pseudodesulfovibrio aespoeensis were negatively correlated with the severity of CD, whereas the abundance of Polynucleobacter wianus was positively correlated. The severity of UC was negatively correlated with the abundance of A. shahii, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica and Akkermansia muciniphilla, while it was positively correlated with the abundance of Pantoea candidatus pantoea carbekii. A regularized logistic regression model was used for the differential diagnosis of the two diseases. The area under the curve (AUC) was used to examine the performance of the model. The model discriminated UC and CD at an AUC of 0.873 (train set), 0.778 (test set), and 0.633 (validation set) and an area under the precision-recall curve (PRAUC) of 0.888 (train set), 0.806 (test set), and 0.474 (validation set).Based on fecal whole-metagenome shotgun (WMS) sequencing, CD and UC were diagnosed using a machine-learning predictive model.

We propose a method that automatically locates biological markers to the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) rings, only requiring B-scan-level presence annotations. We trained a neural network using 22,723 OCT B-Scans of 460 eyes (433 patients) with AMD and DR, annotated with slice-level labels for Intraretinal Fluid (IRF) and Subretinal Fluid (SRF). The neural network outputs were mapped into the corresponding ETDRS rings. We incorporated the class annotations and domain knowledge into a loss function to constrain the output with biologically plausible solutions. The method was tested on a set of OCT volumes with 322 eyes (189 patients) with Diabetic Macular Edema, with slice-level SRF and IRF presence annotations for the ETDRS rings. Our method accurately predicted the presence of IRF and SRF in each ETDRS ring, outperforming previous baselines even in the most challenging scenarios. Our model was also successfully applied to en-face marker segmentation and showed consistency within C-scans, despite not incorporating volume information in the training process.

However, interpreting OCT images requires experts in both OCT images and eye diseases since many factors such as artefacts and concomitant diseases can affect the accuracy of quantitative measurements made by post-processing algorithms. Currently, there is a growing interest in applying deep learning (DL) methods to analyse OCT images automatically. This review summarises the trends in DL-based OCT image analysis in ophthalmology, discusses the current gaps, and provides potential research directions. DL in OCT analysis shows promising performance in several tasks: (1) layers and features segmentation and quantification; (2) disease classification; (3) disease progression and prognosis; and (4) referral triage level prediction. Different studies and trends in the development of DL-based OCT image analysis are described and the following challenges are identified and described: (1) public OCT data are scarce and scattered; (2) models show performance discrepancies in real-world settings; (3) models lack of transparency; (4) there is a lack of societal acceptance and regulatory standards; and (5) OCT is still not widely available in underprivileged areas.

Here we report a 33-year-old male who presented with a 16-year history of diarrhea with black stool and progressive weight loss. He complained of progressive bilateral blurred vision, upper eyelids heaviness, ocular motility impairment, and color blindness. Peripheral neuropathy, bilateral sensorineural deafness, hyperlactatemia, diabetes mellitus, hepatic steatosis, blood coagulation dysfunction, and diffuse leukoencephalopathy were detected in the systemic evaluation. Based on the novel homozygous pathogenic variant in the TYMP gene (c.1159+1G>A), he was diagnosed with MNGIE. On ophthalmic examinations, the thickness of the inner retina and ganglion cell complex significantly decreased. ERG showed diffusely decreased amplitudes. The electronegative electroretinogram, which was first reported in MNGIE, indicated a more severe inner retina impairment. The bilateral papillomacular bundle defect and central vision loss in MNGIE are consistent with classical mitochondrial optic neuropathies' features. According to the literature, pigmentary retinopathy, optic neuropathy, and abnormal pupillary reflexes are uncommon ocular features of MNGIE. This study contributes to a better understanding of ocular manifestations in MNGIE and demonstrates that MNGIE may have dyschromatopsia and an electronegative electroretinogram.",no,yes,no,other,biomarker,,retinal disease,2

2023-11-14,37953587,Computational analysis of missense variants of human MC4R and childhood obesity.,"Industrialized and developing nations face severe public health problems related to childhood obesity. Previous studies revealed that the melanocortin-4 receptor gene (MC4R) is the most prevalent monogenic cause of severe early obesity. Due to its influence on food intake and energy expenditure via neuronal melanocortin-4 receptor pathways, MC4R is recognized as a regulator of energy homeostasis. This study used a variety of computational systems to analyze 273 missense variations of MC4R in silico. Several tools, including PolyPhen, PROVEAN, SIFT, SNAP2, MutPred2, PROVEAN, SNP&GO and Mu-Pro, I-Mutant, PhD-SNP, SAAFEC-SEQ I-Mutant, and ConSurf, were used to make predictions of 13 extremely confident nsSNPs that are harmful and disease-causing (E308k, P299L, D298H, C271F, C271R, P260L, T246N, G243R, C196Y, W174C, Y157S, D126Y, and D90G).

IBD can be subdivided into Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) are observed in up to 47% of patients with IBD, with the most frequent reports of cutaneous manifestations. Among these, pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) and erythema nodosum (EN) are the two most common skin manifestations in IBD, and both are immune-related inflammatory skin diseases. The presence of cutaneous EIMs may either be concordant with intestinal disease activity or have an independent course. Despite some progress in research on EIMs, for instance, ectopic expression of gut-specific mucosal address cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) and chemokine CCL25 on the vascular endothelium of the portal tract have been demonstrated in IBD-related primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), little is understood about the potential pathophysiological associations between IBD and cutaneous EIMs. Whether cutaneous EIMs are inflammatory events with a commonly shared genetic background or environmental risk factors with IBD but independent of IBD or are the result of an extraintestinal extension of intestinal inflammation, remains unclear. The review aims to provide an overview of the two most representative cutaneous manifestations of IBD, describe IBD's epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and histology, and discuss the immunopathophysiology and existing treatment strategies with biologic agents, with a focus on the potential pathophysiological associations between IBD and cutaneous EIMs.",no,yes,no,other,,,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",2

The aim of our study was the standardization of the optimal conditions and primers for sequencing of the gut archaeome using Next Generation Sequencing, and evaluation of the differences between the composition of archaea in patients and healthy volunteers, as well as analysis of the changes that occur in the archaeome of patients depending on disease activity. Newly diagnosed patients were characterized by similar archeal profiles at every taxonomic level as in healthy individuals (the dominance of Methanobacteria at the class level, and Methanobrevibacter at the genus level). In turn, in patients previously diagnosed with Crohn's disease (both in active and remission phase), an increased prevalence of Thermoplasmata, Thermoprotei, Halobacteria (at the class level), and Halococcus, Methanospaera or Picrophilus (at the genus level) were observed. Furthermore, we have found a significant correlation between the patient's parameters and the individual class or species of Archaea. Our study confirms changes in archaeal composition in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease, however, only in long-standing disease. At the beginning of the disease, the archeal profile is similar to that of healthy people. However, in the chronic form of the disease, significant differences in the composition of archaeome begin to appear.

While cardiac T2* MRI is the gold standard in determining cardiac iron accumulation, it is not always feasible, which has led to the search for new biomarkers. Herein, the value of growth differentiation factor-15, galectin-3, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide in predicting cardiac iron accumulation is investigated in asymptomatic children with beta-thalassemia major.Forty-one patients aged 11-21 years and 41 age-, gender-, body mass index-matched healthy controls were included. Serum growth differentiation factor-15, galectin-3, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels were compared between the patients and controls. Additionally, the relations of these biomarkers with cardiac and liver T2 * MRI were investigated in the patients.In the patients, growth differentiation factor-15, galectin-3, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels were higher than healthy controls (p < 0.001, p = 0.025, p < 0.001, respectively). There were no significant correlations of growth differentiation factor-15 and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels with both cardiac and liver T2 * MRI measurements. While there was no significant correlation of serum galectin-3 with cardiac T2 * MRI measurements, a negative correlation was found with liver T2 * MRI measurements (p = 0.040, rho = -0.325).All three biomarkers investigated in this study failed to predict myocardial iron accumulation in asymptomatic children with beta-thalassemia major.

We aimed to assess the causal associations of these cardiac blood biomarkers with dementia and cognition using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR). Independent genetic instruments (p < 5e-7) for troponin T and I, N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and growth-differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) were obtained from previously-performed genome-wide association studies of predominantly European ancestry. Summary statistics for gene-outcome associations in European-ancestry participants, for the two-sample MR analyses, were obtained for general cognitive performance (n = 257,842) and dementia (n = 111,326 clinically diagnosed and ""proxy"" AD cases, and 677,663 controls). Two-sample MR analyses were performed using inverse variance-weighted (IWV) analyses. Sensitivity analyses to evaluate horizontal pleiotropy included weighted median estimator, MR-Egger, and MR using cis-SNPs only. Using IVW, we did not find evidence for possible causal associations between genetically influenced cardiac biomarkers with cognition and dementia. For example, per standard deviation (SD) higher cardiac blood biomarker, the odds ratio for risk of dementia was 1.06 (95%CI 0.90; 1.21) for troponin T, 0.98 (95%CI 0.72; 1.23) for troponin I, 0.97 (95%CI 0.90; 1.06) for NT-proBNP and 1.07 (95%CI 0.93; 1.21) for GDF15. Sensitivity analyses showed higher GDF15 was significantly associated with higher dementia risk and worse cognitive function.

Randomly selected 48 eyes of 48 patients at a similar age with Schirmer value >10 mm were included as controls. Main lacrimal gland SWE measurements in LSG and control groups were recorded and compared as meter/second (m/sec).Mean SWE values of the main lacrimal gland were measured as 2.78 ± 0.66 m/sec and 2.26 ± 0.29 m/sec in LSG and controls. SWE measurements were significantly higher in LSG patients than in controls (p<0.001).

MRI was performed on each patient before any treatment, with T1 mapping acquired using an inversion recovery TrueFISP sequence at several inversion times, from a single slice positioned through the center of both eyes in the axial oblique plane. A phantom study measuring seven different concentrations of vitronectin, a protein released in ischemic eye disease, was undertaken to determine its potential confounding effect on T1 .Ten participants were recruited (eight central retinal vein occlusion, one ocular ischemic syndrome, and one proliferative diabetic retinopathy). Of the eight central retinal vein occlusion cases, there was a statistically different vitreous T1 in the diseased eye compared to the healthy control eye (4.306 vs. 4.518 s, p = 0.008). T1 times did not significantly alter across the range of vitronectin concentrations.Ischemic eye disease decreases vitreous T1 , potentially implying an increase in vitreous partial pressure of oxygen (pO2 ) concentration given what is known from the relationship between 1/T1 and pO2 .

The molecular mechanisms of somal and axonal degeneration are distinct but also overlap, and axonal degeneration can result in retrograde somal degeneration. While the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway acts as a central node in RGC axon degeneration, several newly discovered molecules, such as sterile alpha and Toll/interleukin-1 receptor motif-containing protein 1 and nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 2, also play a critical role in this pathological process following different types of injury.

Graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) were used to detect the metal levels in our participants' urine samples. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression approach was used to include these representative trace elements in a multiple exposure model. Following that, logistic regression models and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) models were used to describe the effect of different elements and also analyze their combined effect. In the single-element model, we discovered that lithium (Li), cadmium (Cd), and strontium (Sr) were all positively related to PDR. The multiple-exposure model revealed a positive relationship between Li and PDR risk, with a maximum quartile OR of 2.80 (95% CI: 1.10-7.16). The BKMR model also revealed that selenium (Se) might act as a protective agent, whereas magnesium (Mg), Li, and Cd may raise the risk of PDR.

2023-11-15,37918258,Different types of cell death in diabetic endothelial dysfunction.,"Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease caused by disorders of insulin secretion and utilization. Long-term hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and disorders of glucose and lipid metabolism cause vascular endothelial cell damage. Endothelial dysfunction is a key feature of diabetic vascular complications such as diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, and atherosclerosis. Importantly, cell death is thought to be a key factor contributing to vascular endothelial injury. Morphologically, cell death can be divided into three forms: type I apoptosis, type II autophagy, and type III necrosis. According to the difference in function, cell death can be divided into accidental cell death (ACD) and regulated cell death (RCD). RCD is a controlled process involving numerous proteins and precise signaling cascades. Multiple subroutines covered by RCD may be involved in diabetic endothelial dysfunction, including apoptosis, autophagy, necroptosis, pyroptosis, entosis, ferroptosis, ferroautophagy, parthanatos, netotic cell death, lysosome-dependent cell death, alkaliptosis, oxeiptosis, cuproptosis, and PANoptosis. This article briefly reviews the mechanism and significance of cell death associated with diabetic endothelial dysfunction, which will help deepen the understanding of diabetic endothelial cell death and provide new therapeutic ideas.",no,yes,no,other,biomarker,,retinopathy,2
2023-11-15,37932307,OIMHS: An Optical Coherence Tomography Image Dataset Based on Macular Hole Manual Segmentation.,"Macular holes, one of the most common macular diseases, require timely treatment. The morphological changes on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images provided an opportunity for direct observation of the disease, and accurate segmentation was needed to identify and quantify the lesions. Developments of such algorithms had been obstructed by a lack of high-quality datasets (the OCT images and the corresponding gold standard macular hole segmentation labels), especially for supervised learning-based segmentation algorithms. In such context, we established a large OCT image macular hole segmentation (OIMHS) dataset with 3859 B-scan images of 119 patients, and each image provided four segmentation labels: retina, macular hole, intraretinal cysts, and choroid. This dataset offered an excellent opportunity for investigating the accuracy and reliability of different segmentation algorithms for macular holes and a new research insight into the further development of clinical research for macular diseases, which included the retina, lesions, and choroid in quantitative analyses.",no,yes,no,other,diagnostic,,retinal disease,2
2023-11-15,37933607,Genetic and molecular biomarkers for geographic atrophy.,"Geographic atrophy (GA) is characterized by atrophy of the retina, retinal pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris, causing a gradual loss of vision over time. Treatment options to prevent initiation or progression of GA are limited; two recently FDA-approved inhibitors of the complement system (pegcetacoplan, avacincaptad pegol) showed a modest decrease in GA lesion growth in phase 3 clinical trials. Exploration of genetic and molecular biomarkers in GA plays a critical role in our battle against this blinding disease to improve early disease detection, to find more effective therapies, and to provide personalized care to patients. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current literature investigating genetic and molecular biomarkers for GA. Genetic studies identified multiple genes and variants that play a role in progression to GA and GA lesion growth, involving pathways such as complement activation, extracellular matrix interaction and lipid metabolism. The number of published studies assessing molecular biomarkers for GA initiation and progression in ocular matrices is limited. Several studies evaluated molecular biomarkers in the systemic circulation, showing higher levels of complement activation and a causal role of lipid subfractions in GA. Larger, well-powered studies are needed to identify novel and validate existing biomarkers, and to investigate the potential of combining genetic and molecular markers with imaging techniques for more accurate diagnosis and monitoring of GA. The development of personalized medicine approaches based on individual genetic and molecular profiles could hold promise for more effective and targeted treatments for this devastating disease.",no,yes,yes,other,biomarker,,retinal disease,2

Vitrectomy and ILM peeling were performed in patients with epiretinal membrane and macular hole. ILM flap specimens were obtained as one disc area size from five locations. Immunofluorescent staining was performed with an antineurofilament heavy antibody. Using a confocal microscope, retinal cell debris density was studied using the ImageJ program.Percent of stained neurofilament was 1.58 ± 1.14% in total (2.45 ± 1.37% in extranasal, 1.97 ± 0.75% in extratemporal, 1.93 ± 1.26% in juxta-nasal, 0.89 ± 0.69% in fovea, and 0.63 ± 0.46% in juxtatemporal). The Kruskal-Wallis test revealed significant differences among groups (P < 0.05). Bonferroni post hoc analysis only confirmed significant difference between juxtatemporal and extranasal groups (P < 0.05).In peeled ILM flap, neurofilaments are rarely detected in the juxtatemporal area. However, they are frequently detected in the extranasal area. [Ophthalmic Surg Lasers Imaging Retina 2023;54:643-648.].",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinal disease,2

In addition, two additional enucleated eyes with DODV underwent histopathological analysis.Of the 13 patients, eight were girls and five were boys. Mean age was 5 years (ranging from 4 months to 10 years old). Of the 15 eyes, 12 (80%) demonstrated temporal dragging and three (20%) had nasal dragging. Retinal vascular abnormalities were present in 11 of the fellow eyes. Multimodal imaging demonstrated features of DODV including direction of traction, outer retinal thickening, increased flow, and other features. Only two (13.3%) eyes required surgical intervention. Mean follow-up was 14 (range 3 to 30 months) months. At last follow-up all eyes remained stable. Last visual acuity ranged from 20/100 to counting fingers. As well, two enucleated globes of adults with retinopathy of prematurity underwent histopathologic evaluation, showing optic nerve fibers that extended from the optic nerve into the DODV.DODV is a sign of various late-stage retinal vascular diseases, associated with poor visual function.

A total of 30,167 participants underwent blood and fundus examinations at a health screening facility in Japan (2015-2016). Fundus photographs were screened by the AI software, RetCAD and DR scores (DRSs) were quantified. The presence of DR was determined by setting two cut-off values prioritizing sensitivity or specificity. DM was defined as four stages (no DM: DM0; advanced DM: DM3) based on treatment history and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels. Associated factors of DR were identified using logistic regression analysis. For cutoff values, multivariate analysis revealed age, sex, systolic blood pressure (SBP), smoking, urinary protein, and HbA1c level as positively associated with the risk of DR among all DM stages. In addition to glycemic control, SBP and Fibrosis-4 index might act as promoting factors for DR at all or an earlier DM stage.

2023-11-15,37957551,Retinal changes and cardiac biomarker assessment in relation to chronic kidney disease: a single centre study.,"The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is rising in Malaysia. Early detection is necessary to prevent disease progression, especially in terms of cardiovascular (CV) risk, the main cause of death in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Retinal changes have proven to be a good predictor of CKD whereas cardiac biomarkers are useful in cardiovascular risk stratification. We aimed to demonstrate the correlation between retinal changes and cardiac biomarkers with CKD.This single-centre cross-sectional study was conducted among patients with CKD stages 3, 4, and 5 (not on dialysis) from the Nephrology Clinic, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre. A total of 84 patients were recruited with an even distribution across all three stages. They underwent fundus photography where images were analysed for vessel calibre (central retinal venular equivalent (CRVE), central retinal arterial equivalent (CRAE), and tortuosity indices. Optical coherence tomography was used to measure macular volume. Blood samples were sent for laboratory measurement of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). These parameters were analysed in relation to CKD.The mean age was 58.8 ± 11.7 years, with 52.4% male and 47.6% female patients. Among them, 64.3% were diabetics. Retinal vessel tortuosity (r = -0.220, p-value = 0.044) had a negative correlation with the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). CRVE showed a positive correlation with proteinuria (r = 0.342, p = 0.001) but negative correlation with eGFR (r = -0.236, p = 0.031). Hs-CRP positively correlated with proteinuria (r = 0.313, p = 0.04) and negatively correlated with eGFR (r = -0.370, p = 0.001). Diabetic patients had a higher CRVE compared to non-diabetic patients (p = 0.02). History of ischaemic heart disease was associated with a smaller macula volume (p = 0.038). Male gender (r2 = 0.066, p = 0.031) and HbA1c had a positive influence (r2 = 0.066, p = 0.047) on retinal vessel tortuosity. There was a positive influence of age (r2 = 0.183, p = 0.012) and hs-CRP (r2 = 0.183, p = 0.045) on CRVE. As for macula volume, it negatively correlated with diabetes (r2 = 0.015, p = 0.040) and positively correlated with smoking (r2 = 0.015, p = 0.012).Our study showed that eGFR value affects retinal vessel tortuosity, CRVE and hs-CRP. These parameters bear potential to be used as non-invasive tools in assessing CKD. However, only macula volume may be associated with CVD risk among the CKD population.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinopathy,2
2023-11-15,37957564,Evaluation of cardiac diagnostic tests findings based on pro-BNP levels in COVID-19 pregnant patients.,"Pro-b-type natriuretic peptide (Pro-BNP) is an inflammatory marker that indicates cardiac damage and inflammation. The elevation of this marker in COVID-19 patients can be used as a predictive factor in the prognosis of these patients.Our cross-sectional study investigated the evaluation of cardiac diagnostic test findings based on pro-BNP levels in pregnant COVID-19 patients in Sayyad Shirazi Hospital, Gorgan, Iran, in 2020-2022. A hundred and ten pregnant patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection were evaluated for cardiac diagnostic tests (electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography (Echo)) and pro-BNP levels. Data were analyzed using SPSS 25 software. Chi-square and Student's t-test will be used to test and compare the relationship between variables and compare them. A P-value less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant. The chi-square test was used to compare the ratio of qualitative variables among the groups if the presuppositions of chi-square distribution were established. Otherwise, Fisher's exact test was used.The mean age of participants were 31.06 ± 5.533 years and 49.1% of patients had pro-BNP levels above the cut-off value for predicting an adverse outcome of COVID-19. The mean ± standard deviation of pro-BNP levels in the low group was 46.125 ± 17.523 pg/mL and in the high group was 878.814 ± 1038.060 pg/mL. This study revealed that patients with higher pro-BNP plasma levels had a significant relation between, myocardial infarction (MI), pericardial effusion (PE), urgent Caesarean section (C/S), and mortality. In addition, no significant relation between gravid, trimester, vaccination, arrhythmia, heart block, and valves diseases with high pro-BNP levels was found.The current research showed that pro-BNP levels can be used as a diagnostic and valuable prognostic tool in pregnant women to diagnose cardiac complications by using ECG and Echo.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,"diagnostic, biomarker",natriuretic,,2
2023-11-15,37958666,Altered Clock Gene Expression in Female APP/PS1 Mice and Aquaporin-Dependent Amyloid Accumulation in the Retina.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by different pathological symptomatology, including disrupted circadian rhythm. The regulation of circadian rhythm depends on the light information that is projected from the retina to the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus. Studies of AD patients and AD transgenic mice have revealed AD retinal pathology, including amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation that can directly interfere with the regulation of the circadian cycle. Although the cause of AD pathology is poorly understood, one of the main risk factors for AD is female gender. Here, we found that female APP/PS1 mice at 6- and 12-months old display severe circadian rhythm disturbances and retinal pathological hallmarks, including Aβ deposits in retinal layers. Since brain Aβ transport is facilitated by aquaporin (AQP)4, the expression of AQPs were also explored in APP/PS1 retina to investigate a potential correlation between retinal Aβ deposits and AQPs expression. Important reductions in AQP1, AQP4, and AQP5 were detected in the retinal tissue of these transgenic mice, mainly at 6-months of age. Taken together, our findings suggest that abnormal transport of Aβ, mediated by impaired AQPs expression, contributes to the retinal degeneration in the early stages of AD.",no,yes,no,animal,biomarker,,retinopathy,2

For this reason, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which biologics elicit their effect on intestinal mucosa is needed. Increasing evidence points toward the involvement of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the pathogenesis of CD, although their role remains poorly studied. We aimed to characterize lncRNA profiles in the ileum and colon from CD patients and evaluate the effect of anti-TNF-α treatment on their transcription. Terminal ileum and left colon samples from 30 patients (active CD = 10, quiescent CD = 10, and healthy controls (HCs) = 10) were collected for RNA-seq. The patients were classified according to endoscopic activity. Furthermore, biopsies were cultured with infliximab, and their transcriptome was determined by Illumina gene expression array. A total of 678 differentially expressed lncRNAs between the terminal ileum and left colon were identified in HCs, 438 in patients with quiescent CD, and 468 in patients with active CD. Additionally, we identified three new lncRNAs in the ileum associated with CD activity. No differences were observed when comparing the effect of infliximab according to intestinal location, presence of disease (CD vs. HC), and activity (active vs. quiescent). The expression profiles of lncRNAs are associated with the location of intestinal tissue, being very different in the ileum and colon. The presence of CD and disease activity are associated with the differential expression of lncRNAs. No modulatory effect of infliximab has been observed in the lncRNA transcriptome.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,crohn's disease,2

Recognizing the potential of the retina as a noninvasive window to the brain, we emphasize the importance of identifying retinal biomarkers in the early stages of AD. However, the examination of AD is not without its challenges, as the similarities shared with other retinal diseases introduce complexity in the search for AD-specific markers. In this review, we address the relevance of using the retina for the early diagnosis of AD and the complex challenges associated with the search for AD-specific retinal biomarkers.

Metabolic pathways considered to have an impact on the development of the disease, as well as genes and polymorphisms that can affect the gene expression, modify the quantity and quality of the encoded product (protein), and significantly alter the metabolic pathway and its control, and thus cause changes in the functioning of metabolic pathways. In this article, the screening of chromosomes and the most important genes involved in the etiology of diabetic retinopathy is presented. The common databases with manuscripts published from January 2000 to June 2023 have been taken into consideration and chosen. This article indicates the role of specific genes in the development of diabetic retinopathy, as well as polymorphic changes within the indicated genes that may have an impact on exacerbating the symptoms of the disease.

We aim to assess the magnitude of this association.We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Scopus libraries for the period up to February 2023 to identify studies reporting cohorts of IBD patients in which NALFLD was evaluated.Eighty-nine studies were analyzed. The overall prevalence of NAFLD was 24.4% (95%CI, 19.3-29.8) in IBD, 20.2% (18.3-22.3) in Crohn's disease and 18.5% (16.4-20.8) for ulcerative colitis. Higher prevalence was found in male compared to female patients, in full papers compared to abstracts, and in cross-sectional studies compared to prospective and retrospective ones. The prevalence of NAFLD in IBD has increased in studies published from 2015 onwards: 23.2% (21.5-24.9) vs. 17.8% (13.2-22.9). Diagnostic methods for NAFLD determined prevalence figures, being highest in patients assessed by controlled attenuation parameter (38.8%; 33.1-44.7) compared to ultrasonography (28.5%; 23.1-34.2) or other methods. The overall prevalence of fibrosis was 16.7% (12.2-21.7) but varied greatly according to the measurement method.One-quarter of patients with IBD might present with NAFLD worldwide.

Mendelian randomization studies were conducted utilizing the data sourced from the genome-wide association study (GWAS) database for the gut microbiome, AMD, and glaucoma. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) estimates were summarized through five Mendelian randomization (MR) methods. We utilized Cochran's Q statistic to evaluate the heterogeneity of the instrumental variables (IVs). Additionally, we employed a ""leave-one-out"" approach to verify the stability of our findings. Inverse variance weighted (IVW) suggests that Eubacterium (oxidoreducens group) and Parabacteroides had a protective effect on AMD. Both weighted median and IVW suggest that Lachnospiraceae (NK4A136 group) and Ruminococcaceae (UCG009) had a protective effect on AMD. However, both weighted median and IVW suggest that Dorea had a risk effect on AMD. Similarly, The IVW of Eubacterium (ventriosum group) showed a risk effect on AMD. The weighted median of Eubacterium (nodatum group), Lachnospiraceae (NC2004 group), and Roseburia had a risk effect on glaucoma. IVW suggested that Ruminococcaceae (UCG004) had a risk effect on glaucoma. Reverse MR analysis found a causal link between Eubacterium (nodatum group) and glaucoma. No causal relationships were found between AMD or glaucoma and the other mentioned bacterial groups. No significant heterogeneity or evidence of horizontal pleiotropy was detected. This study found that certain gut bacteria had protective effects on AMD, while others may be risk factors for AMD or glaucoma. Likewise, reverse MR found that glaucoma led to an increased abundance of certain gut bacteria.

We investigated the hypothesis that diabetes mellitus (DM) induces remodeling to the wall structure in small retinal arterioles. These alterations may allow better understanding of vascular remodeling in DM.We imaged retinal arterioles in one eye of 48 participants (26 with DM and 22 healthy controls) with an AOSLO. Structural metrics of 274 arteriole segments (203 with DM and 71 healthy controls) ≤ 50 µm in outer diameter (OD) were quantified and we compared differences in wall thickness (WT), wall-to-lumen ratio (WLR), inner diameter (ID), OD, and arteriolar index ratio (AIR) between controls and participants with DM. We also compared the individual AIR (iAIR) in groups of individuals.The WLR, WT, and AIRs were significantly different in the arteriole segments of DM participants (P < 0.001). The iAIR was significantly deviated in the DM group (P < 0.001) and further division of the participants with DM into groups revealed that there was an effect of the presence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) on the iAIR (P < 0.001).DM induces remodeling of wall structure in small retinal arterioles and in groups of individuals. The use of AIR allows us to assess remodeling independently of vessel size in the retina and to compute an index for each individual subject.High-resolution retinal imaging allows noninvasive assessment of small retinal vessel remodeling in DM that can improve our understanding of DM and DR in living humans.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinopathy,2

Cox regression models were used to assess associations of IL-6 and IL-18 with coronary heart disease (CHD), ischaemic stroke, heart failure (HF) hospitalization, global CVD (composite of CHD, stroke, and HF), AF, and all-cause death. Over a median follow-up of 7.2 years, there were 1235 global CVD events, 530 AF events, and 1173 deaths. Higher IL-6 [hazard ratio (HR) 1.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.44-1.72 per log unit increase] and IL-18 (HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01-1.26) were significantly associated with global CVD after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. Association between IL-6 and global CVD remained significant after further adjustment for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) but was no longer significant for IL-18 after further adjustments. Interleukin-6 was also associated with increased risk for CHD, HF, and AF after adjustment for covariates. Both IL-6 and IL-18 were associated with increased risk for all-cause death independent of cardiovascular risk factors and other biomarkers.Among older adults, both IL-6 and IL-18 were associated with global CVD and death.

Proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery lesions are associated with adverse prognostic events in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).β2 -AA is associated with the presence of proximal LAD lesions in patients with STEMI.A cohort of 153 patients with STEMI who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) was enrolled in the study. Baseline characteristics were compared between the proximal LAD group (n = 62) and the nonproximal LAD group (n = 91). Admission serum of patients was collected to detect the level of β2 -AA. Data for echocardiogram within 24 hours after PPCI and at the 6-month follow-up were recorded.The optical density values and positive rates of β2 -AA in the proximal LAD group were higher than those in the nonproximal LAD group (p < 0.05). β2 -AA positively correlated with high sensitivity C-reactive protein and peak N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide levels in the proximal LAD group, but those were not relevant in the nonproximal LAD group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that high β2 -AA levels was independently associated with the presence of proximal LAD lesions in patients with STEMI. Furthermore, a receiver operating characteristic curve was used to show the efficiency of β2 -AA levels to detect proximal LAD lesions, and the AUC of the β2-AA OD value was 0.658 (95% confidence interval 0.568-0.749; p = 0.001).The STEMI patients with high β2 -AA levels had a greater possibility having proximal LAD lesions.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,natriuretic,,2

To investigate the diagnostic performance of structural and vascular changes to detect MSNON from controls, we performed a cross-sectional study of 76 eyes from 51 MS participants and 117 eyes from 71 healthy controls. Retinal macular ganglion cell complex (GCC), retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thicknesses, and capillary densities from the superficial (SCP) and deep capillary plexuses (DCP) were obtained from the Cirrus AngioPlex. The best structural parameter for detecting MS was compensated RNFL from the optic nerve head (AUC = 0.85), followed by GCC from the macula (AUC = 0.79), while the best vascular parameter was the SCP (AUC = 0.66). Combining structural and vascular parameters improved the diagnostic performance for MS detection (AUC = 0.90; p<0.001). Including both structure and vasculature in the joint model considerably improved the discrimination between MSNON and normal controls compared to each parameter separately (p = 0.027). Combining optical coherence tomography (OCT)-derived structural metrics and vascular measurements from optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) improved the detection of MSNON.

Although this situation could initiate multiple detrimental pathways that lead to cell death, we considered the possibility of TRPC1 being involved in maintaining calcium homeostasis in the retina by acting as a component of store-operated calcium (SOC) channels with special relevance during photoreceptor degeneration. In this study, we examined by Western blot the expression of TRPC1 in healthy control rat retinas (Sprague-Dawley, SD) and retinas with RP (P23H-1 rats). We also analyzed its specific cellular distribution by immunofluorescence to recognize changes during neurodegeneration and to determine whether its presence is consistent with high basal calcium levels and cellular survival in degenerating retinas. We found that TRPC1 immunostaining was widely distributed across the retina in both rat strains, SD and P23H, and its expression levels significantly increased in the retinas with advanced degeneration compared to the age-control SD rats. In the outer retina, TRPC1 immunoreactivity was distributed in pigment epithelium cells, the photoreceptor inner segments of older animals, and the outer plexiform layer. In the inner retina, TRPC1 labeling was detected in horizontal cells, specific somata of bipolar and amacrine cells, and cellular processes in all the strata of the inner plexiform layer. Somata and processes were also highly immunoreactive in the ganglion cell layer and astrocytes in the nerve fiber layer in all animals. In the P23H rat retinas, the TRPC1 distribution pattern changed according to advancing photoreceptor degeneration and the gliosis reaction, with TRPC1 immunoreactive Müller cells mainly in advanced stages of disease. The cellular TRPC1 immunoreactivity found in this work suggests different mechanisms of activation of these channels depending on the cell type. Furthermore, the results support the idea that photoreceptor loss due to RP is associated with robust TRPC1 protein expression in the rat inner retina and raise the possibility of TRPC1 channels contributing to maintain high basal calcium levels during neurodegeneration and/or maintenance processes of the inner retina.",no,yes,no,animal,biomarker,,retinopathy,2
2023-11-16,37756640,IL-27 regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation of MDSCs in experimental Sjögren's syndrome.,"Excessive NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation has an important function in the pathogenesis of Sjögren's syndrome (SS). Increased and dysfunctional myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) promoted SS. However, NLRP3 inflammasome activation of MDSCs in SS and its regulated components are unclear. Splenic MDSCs were purified by immunomagnetic beads and cultured. Western blot was used to assess NLRP3 inflammasomes. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Here we showed that the NLRP3 inflammasome was activated in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice with SS-like manifestations. We found that NLRP3 inflammasome activation was augmented in MDSCs of SS mice and NLRP3 inflammasome activation was suppressed in IL-27-deficient NOD mice. Consistent with findings of SS mice in vivo, we observed that NLRP3 inflammasome activation by adenosine triphosphate and lipopolysaccharide was remarkably intensified in MDSCs with IL-27 treatment in vitro. Collectively, our data highlighted that IL-27 regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation of MDSCs in experimental SS.",no,yes,no,animal,biomarker,,Sjögren's syndrome,2
2023-11-16,37940228,Plasma Proteomics to Identify Drug Targets for Ischemic Heart Disease.,"Integrated analyses of plasma proteomic and genetic markers in prospective studies can clarify the causal relevance of proteins and discover novel targets for ischemic heart disease (IHD) and other diseases.The purpose of this study was to examine associations of proteomics and genetics data with IHD in population studies to discover novel preventive treatments.We conducted a nested case-cohort study in the China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) involving 1,971 incident IHD cases and 2,001 subcohort participants who were genotyped and free of prior cardiovascular disease. We measured 1,463 proteins in the stored baseline samples using the OLINK EXPLORE panel. Cox regression yielded adjusted HRs for IHD associated with individual proteins after accounting for multiple testing. Moreover, cis-protein quantitative loci (pQTLs) identified for proteins in genome-wide association studies of CKB and of UK Biobank were used as instrumental variables in separate 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) studies involving global CARDIOGRAM+C4D consortium (210,842 IHD cases and 1,378,170 controls).Overall 361 proteins were significantly associated at false discovery rate <0.05 with risk of IHD (349 positively, 12 inversely) in CKB, including N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9. Of these 361 proteins, 212 had cis-pQTLs in CKB, and MR analyses of 198 variants in CARDIOGRAM+C4D identified 13 proteins that showed potentially causal associations with IHD. Independent MR analyses of 307 cis-pQTLs identified in Europeans replicated associations for 4 proteins (FURIN, proteinase-activated receptor-1, Asialoglycoprotein receptor-1, and matrix metalloproteinase-3). Further downstream analyses showed that FURIN, which is highly expressed in endothelial cells, is a potential novel target and matrix metalloproteinase-3 a potential repurposing target for IHD.Integrated analyses of proteomic and genetic data in Chinese and European adults provided causal support for FURIN and multiple other proteins as potential novel drug targets for treatment of IHD.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,natriuretic,,2
2023-11-16,37964190,Study of aqueous humour inflammatory mediators' levels in a cohort of Egyptian patients with diabetic macular oedema.,"The aim was to study aqueous humour inflammatory mediators' levels in a cohort of Egyptian patients with diabetic macular oedema (DMO).This was a case-control prospective study conducted on 2 groups: 25 eyes of 22 (11 females) patients seeking treatment for DMO as patients group, and 10 eyes of 10 (4 females) cataract patients as a control group. Aqueous humour was aspirated before intravitreal injection (patients' group) or cataract surgery (control group). Inflammatory mediators in aqueous humour were measured using a multiplex bead immunoassay kit of 27 pre-mixed cytokines.Eotaxin, interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) and interleukin-8 (IL-8/CXCL8) were found significantly higher in patients' group compared to control group (p = 0.043, 0.037, 0.001, 0.015 respectively). On the contrary, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) were found significantly higher in control group than patients' group (p = 0.003, 0.019 respectively). Basic fibroblast growth factor (Basic-FGF/FGF-2) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) were found higher (but not statistically significant) in controls (p = 0.100 and 0.070 respectively). Additionally, a negative and significant correlation was found between Eotaxin level in aqueous humour and central macular thickness.Some mediators might be implicated in the pathogenesis of DMO either augmenting or suppressing role. Eotaxin, IP-10, MCP-1 and IL-8 might have a role in cases not responding to standard anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. IL-1ra might have a protective role; therefore, the effectiveness of intravitreal injection of IL-1ra homologue needs to be studied in future clinical trials.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinopathy,2
2023-11-16,37964205,Platelet/Albumin ratio and plateletcrit levels are potential new biomarkers for assessing endoscopic inflammatory bowel disease severity.,"Endoscopy is currently recognized as the gold standard for assessing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) severity. However, because the procedure is costly and invasive, endoscopy is not suitable for frequently monitoring intestinal inflammation. In this study, our aim was to identify noninvasive, low cost, and convenient biomarkers for identifying endoscopic IBD activity.In total, 246 patients with IBD (131 with Ulcerative colitis (UC) and 115 with Crohn's disease (CD)) and 369 healthy controls were recruited for this retrospective study. IBD activity was evaluated using endoscopic and clinical examinations. The potential of several inflammatory biomarkers, including platelets (PLT), plateletcrit (PCT), albumin (ALB), highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and platelet-to-albumin ratio (PLT/ALB) to assess endoscopic IBD activity was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses.PLT/ALB ratio, PLT, ALB, and hs-CRP levels were correlated with Mayo scores in UC patients, while PCT, PLT, fibrinogen (FIB), PLT/ALB ratio, hs-CRP, and ESR levels were correlated with Simple Endoscopic Scores for CD (SES-CD) in CD patients. ROC analyses showed that the area under the curve (AUC) value for the PLT/ALB ratio (0.705) was greater than hs-CRP (0.607) and ESR (0.552) values in UC patients. The AUC value for PCT (0.779) was greater than hs-CRP (0.698) and ESR (0.746) values in CD patients.PLT/ALB ratio and PCT biomarkers were the most appropriate of all tested inflammatory biomarkers for assessing endoscopic IBD activity in UC and CD patients, respectively.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",2
2023-11-17,36823080,The Atrial Natriuretic Peptide-to-brain Natriuretic Peptide Ratio Predicts Left Atrial Reverse Remodeling after Rhythm Control Therapy in Patients with Persistent Atrial Fibrillation.,"Objective The association between natriuretic peptide levels in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients with advanced left atrial (LA) remodeling and reverse remodeling after rhythm control therapy has not been clarified. The present study assessed the role of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) measurements to predict LA reverse remodeling after catheter ablation (CA) in persistent AF patients with LA enlargement. Methods This study included 88 persistent AF patients with LA enlargement (volume index >48 mL/m2) who underwent CA. Plasma ANP and BNP levels were analyzed before CA in all patients. The study population was divided into 2 groups according to the extent of decrease in the LA volume index (LAVI) at 6 months after CA responders were those with a ≥15% reduction in the LAVI, and all others were non-responders. Results At follow-up, 58 patients (66%) were classified as responders. The preprocedural ANP level was significantly higher in the responders than in the non-responders (p=0.03). Furthermore, the ANP-to-BNP ratio (ANP/BNP) was significantly higher in the responders than in the non-responders (p<0.01). The ANP/BNP was correlated with the percentage decrease in the LAVI (r=0.391, p<0.01). A multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that the ANP/BNP before CA was an independent predictor of LA reverse remodeling (p<0.01). Conclusion The preprocedural ANP/BNP was a robust predictor of reverse remodeling of the enlarged LA after sinus rhythm restoration by rhythm control therapy in persistent AF patients.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,natriuretic,,2

2023-11-17,37718498,A disease model predicting placebo response and remission status of patients with ulcerative colitis using modified Mayo score.,"The Mayo Clinical Score is used in clinical trials to describe the clinical status of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). It comprises four subscores: rectal bleeding (RB), stool frequency (SF), physician's global assessment, and endoscopy (ENDO). According to recent US Food and Drug Administration guidelines (Ulcerative colitis: developing drugs for treatment, Guidance Document, https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/s. 2022), clinical response and remission should be based on modified Mayo Score (mMS) relying on RB, SF, and ENDO. Typically, ENDO is performed at the beginning and end of each phase, whereas RB and SF are more frequently available. Item response theory (IRT) models allow the shared information to be used for prediction of all subscores at each observation time; therefore, it leverages information from RB and SF to predict ENDO. A UC disease IRT model was developed based on four etrolizumab phase III studies to describe the longitudinal mMS subscores, placebo response, and remission at the end of induction and maintenance. For each subscore, a bounded integer model was developed. The placebo response was characterized by a mono-exponential function acting on all mMS subscores similarly. The final model reliably predicted longitudinal mMS data. In addition, remission was well-predicted by the model, with only 5% overprediction at the end of induction and 3% underprediction at the end of maintenance. External evaluation of the final model using placebo arms from five different studies indicated adequate performance for both longitudinal mMS subscores and remission status. These results suggest utility of the current disease model for informed decision making in UC clinical development, such as assisting future clinical trial designs and evaluations.",no,yes,no,other,biomarker,,ulcerative colitis,2

However, the etiology of VKH disease remains unclear. Here, we performed the first trio-based whole-exome sequencing study, which enrolled 25 VKH patients and 50 controls, followed by a study of 2081 VKH patients from a Han Chinese population to uncover detrimental mutations. A total of 15 de novo mutations in VKH patients were identified, with one of the most important being the membrane palmitoylated protein 2 (MPP2) p.K315N (MPP2-N315) mutation. The MPP2-N315 mutation was highly deleterious according to bioinformatic predictions. Additionally, this mutation appears rare, being absent from the 1000 Genome Project and Genome Aggregation Database, and it is highly conserved in 10 species, including humans and mice. Subsequent studies showed that pathological phenotypes and retinal vascular leakage were aggravated in MPP2-N315 mutation knock-in or MPP2-N315 adeno-associated virus-treated mice with experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). In vitro, we used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR‒Cas9) gene editing technology to delete intrinsic MPP2 before overexpressing wild-type MPP2 or MPP2-N315. Levels of cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-17E, and vascular endothelial growth factor A, were increased, and barrier function was destroyed in the MPP2-N315 mutant ARPE19 cells. Mechanistically, the MPP2-N315 mutation had a stronger ability to directly bind to ANXA2 than MPP2-K315, as shown by LC‒MS/MS and Co-IP, and resulted in activation of the ERK3/IL-17E pathway. Overall, our results demonstrated that the MPP2-K315N mutation may increase susceptibility to VKH disease.",no,yes,no,animal,biomarker,,retinal disease,2
2023-11-17,37856107,Deep Learning Performance of Ultra-Widefield Fundus Imaging for Screening Retinal Lesions in Rural Locales.,"Retinal diseases are the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, and timely detection contributes to prevention of permanent vision loss, especially for patients in rural areas with limited medical resources. Deep learning systems (DLSs) based on fundus images with a 45° field of view have been extensively applied in population screening, while the feasibility of using ultra-widefield (UWF) fundus image-based DLSs to detect retinal lesions in patients in rural areas warrants exploration.To explore the performance of a DLS for multiple retinal lesion screening using UWF fundus images from patients in rural areas.In this diagnostic study, a previously developed DLS based on UWF fundus images was used to screen for 5 retinal lesions (retinal exudates or drusen, glaucomatous optic neuropathy, retinal hemorrhage, lattice degeneration or retinal breaks, and retinal detachment) in 24 villages of Yangxi County, China, between November 17, 2020, and March 30, 2021.The captured images were analyzed by the DLS and ophthalmologists.The performance of the DLS in rural screening was compared with that of the internal validation in the previous model development stage. The image quality, lesion proportion, and complexity of lesion composition were compared between the model development stage and the rural screening stage.A total of 6222 eyes in 3149 participants (1685 women [53.5%]; mean [SD] age, 70.9 [9.1] years) were screened. The DLS achieved a mean (SD) area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.918 (0.021) (95% CI, 0.892-0.944) for detecting 5 retinal lesions in the entire data set when applied for patients in rural areas, which was lower than that reported at the model development stage (AUC, 0.998 [0.002] [95% CI, 0.995-1.000]; P < .001). Compared with the fundus images in the model development stage, the fundus images in this rural screening study had an increased frequency of poor quality (13.8% [860 of 6222] vs 0%), increased variation in lesion proportions (0.1% [6 of 6222]-36.5% [2271 of 6222] vs 14.0% [2793 of 19 891]-21.3% [3433 of 16 138]), and an increased complexity of lesion composition.This diagnostic study suggests that the DLS exhibited excellent performance using UWF fundus images as a screening tool for 5 retinal lesions in patients in a rural setting. However, poor image quality, diverse lesion proportions, and a complex set of lesions may have reduced the performance of the DLS; these factors in targeted screening scenarios should be taken into consideration in the model development stage to ensure good performance.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,diagnostic,,retinal disease,2
2023-11-17,37856110,Clinician-Driven AI: Code-Free Self-Training on Public Data for Diabetic Retinopathy Referral.,"Democratizing artificial intelligence (AI) enables model development by clinicians with a lack of coding expertise, powerful computing resources, and large, well-labeled data sets.To determine whether resource-constrained clinicians can use self-training via automated machine learning (ML) and public data sets to design high-performing diabetic retinopathy classification models.This diagnostic quality improvement study was conducted from January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2021. A self-training method without coding was used on 2 public data sets with retinal images from patients in France (Messidor-2 [n = 1748]) and the UK and US (EyePACS [n = 58 689]) and externally validated on 1 data set with retinal images from patients of a private Egyptian medical retina clinic (Egypt [n = 210]). An AI model was trained to classify referable diabetic retinopathy as an exemplar use case. Messidor-2 images were assigned adjudicated labels available on Kaggle; 4 images were deemed ungradable and excluded, leaving 1744 images. A total of 300 images randomly selected from the EyePACS data set were independently relabeled by 3 blinded retina specialists using the International Classification of Diabetic Retinopathy protocol for diabetic retinopathy grade and diabetic macular edema presence; 19 images were deemed ungradable, leaving 281 images. Data analysis was performed from February 1 to February 28, 2021.Using public data sets, a teacher model was trained with labeled images using supervised learning. Next, the resulting predictions, termed pseudolabels, were used on an unlabeled public data set. Finally, a student model was trained with the existing labeled images and the additional pseudolabeled images.The analyzed metrics for the models included the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. The Fisher exact test was performed, and 2-tailed P values were calculated for failure case analysis.For the internal validation data sets, AUROC values for performance ranged from 0.886 to 0.939 for the teacher model and from 0.916 to 0.951 for the student model. For external validation of automated ML model performance, AUROC values and accuracy were 0.964 and 93.3% for the teacher model, 0.950 and 96.7% for the student model, and 0.890 and 94.3% for the manually coded bespoke model, respectively.These findings suggest that self-training using automated ML is an effective method to increase both model performance and generalizability while decreasing the need for costly expert labeling. This approach advances the democratization of AI by enabling clinicians without coding expertise or access to large, well-labeled private data sets to develop their own AI models.",no,yes,no,other,diagnostic,,retinopathy,2
2023-11-17,37856135,Diverse Research Teams and Underrepresented Groups in Clinical Studies.,"Several ophthalmic diseases disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minority patients, yet most clinical trials struggle to enroll cohorts that are demographically representative of disease burden; some barriers to recruitment include time and transportation, language and cultural differences, and fear and mistrust of research due to historical abuses. Incorporating diversity within the research team has been proposed as a method to increase trust and improve engagement among potential study participants.To examine how demographic factors of potential research participants and personnel may be associated with patient consent rates to participate in prospective ophthalmic clinical studies.This retrospective cohort study included patients from an urban, academic hospital who were approached for consent to participate in prospective ophthalmic clinical studies conducted between January 2015 and December 2021.Multivariable logistic regression assessing associations between patient and research personnel demographics and rates of affirmative consent to participate was used.In total, 1380 patients (mean [SD] age, 58.6 [14.9] years; 50.3% male) who were approached for consent to participate in 10 prospective ophthalmic clinical studies were included. Of prospective patients, 566 (43.5%) were Black; 327 (25.1%), Hispanic or Latino; 373 (28.6%), White; 36 (2.8%), other race and ethnicity; and 78 (5.8%) declined to answer. Black patients (odds ratio [OR], 0.32; 95% CI, 0.24-0.44; P < .001) and Hispanic or Latino patients (OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.20-0.47; P < .001) were less likely to consent compared with White patients. Patients with lower socioeconomic status were less likely to consent than patients with higher socioeconomic status (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.33-0.53; P < .001). Concordance between patient and research staff race and ethnicity was associated with increased odds of affirmative consent (OR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.99-3.73; P < .001).In this cohort study, patients from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups and those with lower socioeconomic status were less likely to participate in ophthalmic clinical studies.

The purpose of this study was to determine the usefulness of the CHOP ROP for the prediction of treatable ROP.This was a prospective observational study. Babies <34 weeks of GA, BW <2000 grams, and GA 34-36 weeks with risk factors such as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) were included; ROP screening, follow-up, and treatment were performed based on national guidelines. The average daily postnatal weight gain was measured, and the CHOP nomogram was plotted. Babies were categorized as high risk or low risk based on the ""CHOP"" alarm. The sensitivity and specificity of the CHOP ROP for the detection of treatable ROP were determined. In case of poor sensitivity, a new cutoff alarm level was planned using logistic regression analysis.Of 62 screened infants, 23 infants did not fulfill the criteria of the CHOP algorithm and were excluded. Thus, in the study on 39 infants, the predictive model with an alarm level of 0.014 had 100% specificity and 20% sensitivity. With the ""new"" alarm level (cutoff) of 0.0003, the CHOP nomogram could detect all the infants who developed treatable ROP, that is, sensitivity increased to 100% but specificity decreased to 10.5%.The CHOP ROP model with a cutoff point (0.014) performed poorly in predicting severe ROP in the study.

2023-11-17,37935047,Evaluation of Ex Vivo Adrenocorticotropic Hormone Responsiveness of Human Fetal Testis.,"Testicular adrenal rest tumors (TARTs), commonly occurring in males with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, may arise from chronic stimulation of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-sensitive cells in the testes. It is not yet established whether the human fetal testis (HFT) is responsive to ACTH. To investigate this, we cultured HFT tissue with and without ACTH for up to 5 days, and quantified adrenal steroid hormones and expression of adrenal steroidogenic enzymes. Fetal testis and adrenal tissue produced high levels of testosterone and cortisol, respectively, indicating viability. In contrast to fetal adrenal tissues, the expression of ACTH receptor MC2R was either absent or expressed at extremely low levels in ex vivo HFT tissue and no clear response to ACTH in gene expression or steroid hormone production was observed. Altogether, this study suggests that the HFT is unresponsive to ACTH, which would indicate that a TART does not arise from fetal testicular cells chronically exposed to ACTH in utero.",yes,no,no,in vitro,biomarker,melanocortin,,2
2023-11-17,37963072,Missense mutations in CRX homeodomain cause dominant retinopathies through two distinct mechanisms.,"Homeodomain transcription factors (HD TFs) are instrumental to vertebrate development. Mutations in HD TFs have been linked to human diseases, but their pathogenic mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we use Cone-Rod Homeobox (CRX) as a model to decipher the disease-causing mechanisms of two HD mutations, p.E80A and p.K88N, that produce severe dominant retinopathies. Through integrated analysis of molecular and functional evidence in vitro and in knock-in mouse models, we uncover two novel gain-of-function mechanisms: p.E80A increases CRX-mediated transactivation of canonical CRX target genes in developing photoreceptors; p.K88N alters CRX DNA-binding specificity resulting in binding at ectopic sites and severe perturbation of CRX target gene expression. Both mechanisms produce novel retinal morphological defects and hinder photoreceptor maturation distinct from loss-of-function models. This study reveals the distinct roles of E80 and K88 residues in CRX HD regulatory functions and emphasizes the importance of transcriptional precision in normal development.",no,yes,no,animal,biomarker,,retinopathy,2
2023-11-17,37968437,Predicting glaucoma progression using deep learning framework guided by generative algorithm.,"Glaucoma is a slowly progressing optic neuropathy that may eventually lead to blindness. To help patients receive customized treatment, predicting how quickly the disease will progress is important. Structural assessment using optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be used to visualize glaucomatous optic nerve and retinal damage, while functional visual field (VF) tests can be used to measure the extent of vision loss. However, VF testing is patient-dependent and highly inconsistent, making it difficult to track glaucoma progression. In this work, we developed a multimodal deep learning model comprising a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, for glaucoma progression prediction. We used OCT images, VF values, demographic and clinical data of 86 glaucoma patients with five visits over 12 months. The proposed method was used to predict VF changes 12 months after the first visit by combining past multimodal inputs with synthesized future images generated using generative adversarial network (GAN). The patients were classified into two classes based on their VF mean deviation (MD) decline: slow progressors (< 3 dB) and fast progressors (> 3 dB). We showed that our generative model-based novel approach can achieve the best AUC of 0.83 for predicting the progression 6 months earlier. Further, the use of synthetic future images enabled the model to accurately predict the vision loss even earlier (9 months earlier) with an AUC of 0.81, compared to using only structural (AUC = 0.68) or only functional measures (AUC = 0.72). This study provides valuable insights into the potential of using synthetic follow-up OCT images for early detection of glaucoma progression.",no,yes,no,other,diagnostic,,retinal disease,2
2023-11-17,37968638,The role of admixture in the rare variant contribution to inflammatory bowel disease.,"Identification of rare variants involved in complex, polygenic diseases like Crohn's disease (CD) has accelerated with the introduction of whole exome/genome sequencing association studies. Rare variants can be used in both diagnostic and therapeutic assessments; however, since they are likely to be restricted to specific ancestry groups, their contributions to risk assessment need to be evaluated outside the discovery population. Prior studies implied that the three known rare variants in NOD2 are absent in West African and Asian populations and only contribute in African Americans via admixture.Whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from 3418 African American individuals, 1774 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) cases, and 1644 controls were used to assess odds ratios and allele frequencies (AF), as well as haplotype-specific ancestral origins of European-derived CD variants discovered in a large exome-wide association study. Local and global ancestry was performed to assess the contribution of admixture to IBD contrasting European and African American cohorts.Twenty-five rare variants associated with CD in European discovery cohorts are typically five-fold lower frequency in African Americans. Correspondingly, where comparisons could be made, the rare variants were found to have a predicted four-fold reduced burden for IBD in African Americans, when compared to European individuals. Almost all of the rare CD European variants were found on European haplotypes in the African American cohort, implying that they contribute to disease risk in African Americans primarily due to recent admixture. In addition, proportion of European ancestry correlates the number of rare CD European variants each African American individual carry, as well as their polygenic risk of disease. Similar findings were observed for 23 mutations affecting 10 other common complex diseases for which the rare variants were discovered in European cohorts.European-derived Crohn's disease rare variants are even more rare in African Americans and contribute to disease risk mainly due to admixture, which needs to be accounted for when performing cross-ancestry genetic assessments.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,crohn's disease,2

The insulin resistance index in the HOMA (HOMA-IR, u) and the β-cell function assessment index (HOMA-B) were calculated using the calculator -version 2.2.3 at www.dtu.ox.ac.uk.Cluster analysis revealed: Cluster 1 included 455 patients with preserved β-cell function (HOMA-B 82.97±23.28%), moderate insulin resistance (HOMA-IR 5.57±4.72) and higher diastolic BP; Cluster 2 in 1658 patients with reduced function of β-cells (HOMA-B 21.71±12.51%), the lowest indices of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR 3.50±2.48) and was characterized by a longer duration of diabetes, high fasting glycemia , HbA1c, higher eGFR and MAU, men compared with women had a 31% higher risk of developing diabetic neuropathy and 28% more diabetic nephropathy; Cluster 3 in 18 patients with high function of β-cells (HOMA-B 228.53±63.32%), severe insulin resistance (HOMA-IR 6.92±4.77), features were high incidence of men, shorter duration of diabetes, lower fasting glycemia and HbA1c, lower diastolic BP and eGFR, high incidence of early development of diabetic retinopathy after 4.00±3.6 years.Cluster analysis in patients with different durations of diabetes mellitus confirmed the possibility of using cluster analysis to identify T2DM phenotypes in the Russian population. The clusters differed in the clinical characteristics of patients, the frequency and risk of diabetic complications.

The study was designed as observational and cross-sectional and was conducted between June 2020 and February 2021. The average thicknesses of the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL), ganglion cell complex (GCC), and macula also were measured using a spectral domain optical coherence tomography analysis. The vessel densities of the superficial and deep capillary plexuses of the macula, foveal avascular zone, and radial peripapillary capillary plexus of the optic disc were quantified by optical coherence tomography angiography.In all quadrants, the RNFL and GCC were thinner in patients with neurologic symptoms of COVID-19 (p < 0.05). None of the measurements of the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study regions significantly differed between patients with and without COVID-19 symptoms (p > 0.05). The foveal avascular zone area, perimeter, circularity index, and vessel densities (%) of the global and inner and outer circles of superficial capillary plexuses and deep capillary plexus and global and superior and inferior halves of the radial peripapillary capillary plexus measurements were found to significantly differ between the symptomatic COVID-19 group and the asymptomatic COVID-19 and control groups (p < 0.05).RNFL and GCC thickness evaluation with optical coherence tomography and vessel density evaluation with optical coherence tomography angiography can be considered remarkable diagnostic methods for retinal neurovascular abnormalities and a biomarker for microvascular abnormalities after infection with SARS-CoV-2.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"diagnostic, biomarker",,"retinopathy, retinal disease",2
2023-11-20,37043386,Prediction of Acute Myocardial Injury in Noncardiac Surgery in Patients at Risk for Major Adverse Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Events: A Multivariable Risk Model.,"The best use of perioperative cardiac biomarkers assessment is still under discussion. Massive postoperative troponin surveillance can result in untenably high workloads and costs for health care systems and potentially harmful interventions for patients. In a cohort of patients at risk for major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs), we aimed to (1) determine whether preoperative biomarkers can identify patients at major risk for acute myocardial injury in noncardiac surgery, (2) develop a risk model for acute myocardial injury prediction, and (3) propose an algorithm to optimize postoperative troponin surveillance.Prospective, single-center cohort study enrolling consecutive adult patients (≥45 years) at risk for MACCE scheduled for intermediate-to-high-risk noncardiac surgery. Baseline high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT) and N-terminal fragment of pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), as well as hsTnT on the first 3 postoperative days were obtained. The main outcome was the occurrence of acute myocardial injury. Candidate predictors of acute myocardial injury were baseline concentrations of hsTnT ≥14 ng/L and NT-proBNP ≥300 pg/mL and preoperative and intraoperative variables. A multivariable risk model and a decision curve were constructed.Of 732 patients, 42.1% had elevated hsTnT and 37.3% had elevated NT-proBNP levels at baseline. Acute myocardial injury occurred in 161 patients (22%). Elevated baseline hsTnT, found in 84% of patients with acute myocardial injury, was strongly associated with this outcome: odds ratio (OR), 12.08 (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.78-19.42). Logistic regression identified 6 other independent predictors for acute myocardial injury: age, sex, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <45 mL·min -1 ·1.73 m -2 , functional capacity <4 METs or unknown, NT-proBNP ≥300 pg/mL, and estimated intraoperative blood loss. The c -statistic for the risk model was 77% (95% CI, 0.73-0.81). The net benefit of the model began at a risk threshold of 7%.Baseline determination of cardiac biomarkers in patients at risk for MACCE shortly before intermediate- or high-risk noncardiac surgery helps identify those with the highest risk for acute myocardial injury. A baseline hsTnT ≥14 ng/L indicates the need for postoperative troponin surveillance. In patients with baseline hsTnT <14 ng/L, our 6-predictor model will identify additional patients at risk for acute myocardial injury who may also benefit from postoperative surveillance.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,natriuretic,,2
2023-11-20,37075250,Fluorescein Angiography Findings in Susac Syndrome: A Multicenter Retrospective Case Series.,"Susac syndrome is a vasculopathy, resulting in the classic triad of branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO), inner ear ischemia, and brain ischemia. In this retrospective chart review, we characterize fluorescein angiography (FA) findings and other ancillary studies in Susac syndrome, including the appearance of persistent disease activity and the occurrence of new subclinical disease on FA.This multicenter, retrospective case series was institutional review board-approved and included patients with the complete triad of Susac syndrome evaluated with FA, contrasted MRI of the brain, and audiometry from 2010 to 2020. The medical records were reviewed for these ancillary tests, along with demographics, symptoms, visual acuity, visual field defects, and findings on fundoscopy. Clinical relapse was defined as any objective evidence of disease activity during the follow-up period after initial induction of clinical quiescence. The main outcome measure was the sensitivity of ancillary testing, including FA, MRI, and audiometry, to detect relapse.Twenty of the 31 (64%) patients had the complete triad of brain, retinal, and vestibulocochlear involvement from Susac syndrome and were included. Median age at diagnosis was 43.5 years (range 21-63), and 14 (70%) were women. Hearing loss occurred in 20 (100%), encephalopathy in 13 (65%), vertigo in 15 (75%), and headaches in 19 (95%) throughout the course of follow-up. Median visual acuity at both onset and final visit was 20/20 in both eyes. Seventeen (85%) had BRAO at baseline, and 10 (50%) experienced subsequent BRAO during follow-up. FA revealed nonspecific leakage from previous arteriolar damage in 20 (100%), including in patients who were otherwise in remission. Of the 11 episodes of disease activity in which all testing modalities were performed, visual field testing/fundoscopy was abnormal in 4 (36.4%), MRI brain in 2 (18.2%), audiogram in 8 (72.7%), and FA in 9 (81.8%).New leakage on FA is the most sensitive marker of active disease. Persistent leakage represents previous damage, whereas new areas of leakage suggest ongoing disease activity that requires consideration of modifying immunosuppressive therapy.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,diagnostic,,retinal disease,2
2023-11-20,37319371,Associations of Diabetic Retinopathy Severity With High Ambulatory Blood Pressure and Suppressed Serum Renin Levels.,"The relationships between serum renin levels, severity of diabetic retinopathy (DR), and 24-hour blood pressure (BP) have not been previously reported.To explore causes for DR and the relationships of 24-hour ambulatory BP, and hormone levels with the severity of DR.The diabetic patients were classified as having no DR, simple DR, or severe DR (preproliferative DR plus proliferative DR) based on funduscopic examination, and we measured 24-hour BP, serum active renin (ARC), aldosterone (SAC), adrenocorticotropic hormone, and cortisol levels in each group.Compared to those with no DR or simple DR, patients with severe DR showed significantly higher 24-hour BPs, including daytime and nighttime systolic and diastolic BP levels, independent of diabetic duration and HbA1c levels. The variability of nighttime systolic BP was greater in patients with severe DR than in those with nonsevere DR, although nocturnal BP reduction was similar between the groups. The ambulatory BPs were significantly inversely associated with ARC. The ARC was significantly lower in severe DR patients than in those with no DR or simple DR (3.2 [1.5-13.6] vs 9.8 [4.6-18.0] pg/mL, P < .05), but there were no differences in SAC in patients taking calcium channel blockers and/or α-blockers. No associations were found between DR severity and other hormone levels.Severe DR was associated with higher 24-hour BPs and suppressed ARC. These findings suggest that mineralocorticoid receptor overactivation may play a role in higher BP levels and severe DR in diabetic patients.",no,yes,no,other,biomarker,,retinopathy,2

2023-11-20,37339320,Prevalence of Deleterious Variants in MC3R in Patients With Constitutional Delay of Growth and Puberty.,"The melanocortin 3 receptor (MC3R) has recently emerged as a critical regulator of pubertal timing, linear growth, and the acquisition of lean mass in humans and mice. In population-based studies, heterozygous carriers of deleterious variants in MC3R report a later onset of puberty than noncarriers. However, the frequency of such variants in patients who present with clinical disorders of pubertal development is currently unknown.This work aimed to determine whether deleterious MC3R variants are more frequently found in patients clinically presenting with constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP) or normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH).We examined the sequence of MC3R in 362 adolescents with a clinical diagnosis of CDGP and 657 patients with nIHH, experimentally characterized the signaling properties of all nonsynonymous variants found and compared their frequency to that in 5774 controls from a population-based cohort. Additionally, we established the relative frequency of predicted deleterious variants in individuals with self-reported delayed vs normally timed menarche/voice-breaking in the UK Biobank cohort.MC3R loss-of-function variants were infrequent but overrepresented in patients with CDGP (8/362 [2.2%]; OR = 4.17; P = .001). There was no strong evidence of overrepresentation in patients with nIHH (4/657 [0.6%]; OR = 1.15; P = .779). In 246 328 women from the UK Biobank, predicted deleterious variants were more frequently found in those self-reporting delayed (aged ≥16 years) vs normal age at menarche (OR = 1.66; P = 3.90E-07).We have found evidence that functionally damaging variants in MC3R are overrepresented in individuals with CDGP but are not a common cause of this phenotype.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,melanocortin,,2

Secondary outcome was cardiovascular death or MI. Improvements in prediction were assessed by cause-specific hazard ratios (HR) and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) for an interquartile increase in each biomarker, controlling for other biomarkers, in a base clinical model of risk factors, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and ischemia severity. Secondary analyses were performed among patients in whom core-lab confirmed severity of CAD was ascertained by computed cardiac tomographic angiography (CCTA).Baseline levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), high sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT), growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), lipoprotein a (Lp[a]), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), Cystatin C, soluble CD 40 ligand (sCD40L), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3).Among 757 biorepository participants, median (IQR) follow-up was 3 (2-5) years, age was 67 (61-72) years, and 144 (19%) were female; 508 had severity of CAD by CCTA available. In an adjusted multimarker model with hsTnT, GDF-15, NT-proBNP and sCD40L, the adjusted HR for the primary outcome per interquartile increase in each biomarker was 1.58 (95% CI 1.22, 2.205), 1.60 (95% CI 1.16, 2.20), 1.61 (95% 1.22, 2.14), and 1.46 (95% 1.12, 1.90), respectively. The adjusted multimarker model also improved prediction compared with the clinical model, increasing the AUC from 0.710 to 0.792 (P < .01) and 0.714 to 0.783 (P < .01) for the primary and secondary outcomes, respectively. Similar findings were observed after adjusting for core-lab confirmed atherosclerosis severity.Among ISCHEMIA biorepository participants, biomarkers of myocyte injury/distension, inflammation, and platelet activity improved cardiovascular event prediction in addition to risk factors, LVEF, and assessments of ischemia and atherosclerosis severity.

It is closely associated with immune dysregulation in the intestines. However, the mechanisms underlying the role of immune-related N7-methylguanosine (m7G) internal modification in UC remain unclear.We conducted a screening of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with m7G and performed immune infiltration analysis. We then investigated the correlation between m7G-related DEGs and immune cells or pathways. To further explore the functional implications, we conducted functional enrichment analysis to identify gene modules that strongly correlated with hub gene expression. In addition, we constructed a miRNA regulatory network for the hub genes in UC. Furthermore, we examined the association between hub genes and disease remission in UC patients undergoing biologic therapy.We obtained 13 m7G-related DEGs and conducted an in-depth analysis of immune infiltration. Among them, we identified five hub genes (NUDT7, NUDT12, POLR2H, QKI, and PRKCB) that showed diagnostic potential for UC. Through WGCNA and KEGG analysis, we found that gene modules strongly correlated with m7G hub gene expression were enriched in inflammation-related pathways. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a significant association between changes in hub gene expression levels and disease remission in UC patients undergoing biologic therapy.The findings of this study demonstrate that five m7G-related DEGs, including the m7G-modified recognition protein QKI, play a key role in the occurrence and progression of UC intestinal inflammation, which is closely related to intestinal immunity. These results provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of m7G modification in UC development and offer new perspectives for exploring novel therapeutic targets for UC.",no,yes,no,other,"diagnostic, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,2
2023-11-20,37913889,Beta-mannosidosis in a domestic cat associated with a missense variant in MANBA.,"A 6-month-old cat of unknown ancestry presented for a neurologic evaluation due to progressive motor impairment. Complete physical and neurologic examinations suggested the disorder was likely to be hereditary, although the signs were not consistent with any previously described inherited disorders in cats. Due to the progression of disease signs including severely impaired motor function and cognitive decline, the cat was euthanized at approximately 10.5 months of age. Whole genome sequence analysis identified a homozygous missense variant c.2506G > A in MANBA that predicts a p.Gly836Arg alteration in the encoded lysosomal enzyme β -mannosidase. This variant was not present in the whole genome or whole exome sequences of any of the 424 cats represented in the 99 Lives Cat Genome dataset. β -Mannosidase enzyme activity was undetectable in brain tissue homogenates from the affected cat, whereas α-mannosidase enzyme activities were elevated compared to an unaffected cat. Postmortem examination of brain and retinal tissues revealed massive accumulations of vacuolar inclusions in most cells, similar to those reported in animals of other species with hereditary β -mannosidosis. Based on these findings, the cat likely suffered from β -mannosidosis due to the abolition of β -mannosidase activity associated with the p.Gly836Arg amino acid substitution. p.Gly836 is located in the C-terminal region of the protein and was not previously known to be involved in modulating enzyme activity. In addition to the vacuolar inclusions, some cells in the brain of the affected cat contained inclusions that exhibited lipofuscin-like autofluorescence.

The disability progression in pwMS may be associated with retinal changes assessed with optical coherence tomography (OCT). This meta-analysis aims at synthesizing the correlations between OCT measurements of disability in pwMS.We systematically searched four databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science) from inception to November 2022, then conducted a meta-analysis using a random effects model to determine the pooled correlation coefficient(r) between OCT measurements and disability scales by R version 4.2.3 with the meta version 6.2-1 package.From 3129 studies, 100 studies were included. Among 9051 pwMS, the female-to-male ratio was 3.15:1, with a mean age of 39.57 ± 6.07 years. The mean disease duration and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) were 8.5 ± 3.7 and 2.7 ± 1.1, respectively. Among the pooled subgroup analyses, macular ganglion cell inner plexiform layer (mGCIPL) in patients with relapsing-remitting (pwRRMS) and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) in patients with progressive MS (pwPMS) had strong correlations with EDSS, r = -0.33 (95% CI: -0.45 to -0.20, I2 = 45%, z-score = -4.86, p < 0.001) and r = -0.20 (95% CI:-0.58 to 0.26, I2 = 76%, z-score = -0.85, p = 0.395), respectively.

2023-11-20,37930995,Her6 and Prox1a are novel regulators of photoreceptor regeneration in the zebrafish retina.,"Damage to light-sensing photoreceptors (PRs) occurs in highly prevalent retinal diseases. As humans cannot regenerate new PRs, these diseases often lead to irreversible blindness. Intriguingly, animals, such as the zebrafish, can regenerate PRs efficiently and restore functional vision. Upon injury, mature Müller glia (MG) undergo reprogramming to adopt a stem cell-like state. This process is similar to cellular dedifferentiation, and results in the generation of progenitor cells, which, in turn, proliferate and differentiate to replace lost retinal neurons. In this study, we tested whether factors involved in dedifferentiation of Drosophila CNS are implicated in the regenerative response in the zebrafish retina. We found that hairy-related 6 (her6) negatively regulates of PR production by regulating the rate of cell divisions in the MG-derived progenitors. prospero homeobox 1a (prox1a) is expressed in differentiated PRs and may promote PR differentiation through phase separation. Interestingly, upon Her6 downregulation, Prox1a is precociously upregulated in the PRs, to promote PR differentiation; conversely, loss of Prox1a also induces a downregulation of Her6. Together, we identified two novel candidates of PR regeneration that cross regulate each other; these may be exploited to promote human retinal regeneration and vision recovery.",no,yes,no,animal,biomarker,,retinal disease,2

Cross-sectional OCT images were used to determine the VNR at two arteriovenous crossings per eye.Overall, 378 arteriovenous crossings were analyzed. The VNR of arterial overcrossings of fellow eyes (27.7% ± 11.1%) and BRVO eyes (27.3% ± 9.76%) were significantly higher than those in the young (16.0% ± 7.9%, all P < 0.001) and control (22.0% ± 8.81%, P < 0.001, P = 0.003, respectively) groups. The VNR of arterial overcrossings was significantly larger than that of venous overcrossings (24.0% ± 10.5% vs. 20.6% ± 13.0%, P = 0.021). A linear mixed-effects model showed that the VNR was significantly higher in arterial overcrossings, crossings with larger arterial internal diameters, smaller venous internal diameters, and participants with older age and a BRVO history.The VNR in arterial overcrossings was higher in BRVO eyes and even in the fellow eyes. Thus, a higher VNR in arterial overcrossings may contribute to BRVO development, and crossings with factors contributing to higher VNR might be associated with a risk of BRVO.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinal disease,2

2023-11-20,37975847,Next-Generation Sequencing of Vitreoretinal Lymphoma by Vitreous Liquid Biopsy: Diagnostic Potential and Genotype/Phenotype Correlation.,"To determine the diagnostic potential of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in vitreous samples, analyze genotype-phenotype characteristics, and compare NGS of matched vitreous and brain samples in patients with associated central nervous system lymphoma (CNSL).A total of 32 patients suspected of vitreoretinal lymphoma (VRL) who underwent diagnostic vitrectomy and NGS were included in this retrospective observational case-series. Fresh vitreous specimens from diagnostic vitrectomy of VRL-suspected patients underwent NGS using a custom panel targeting 747 candidate genes for lymphoma. They also underwent malignancy cytology, interleukin (IL)-10/IL-6, immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH)/immunoglobulin kappa light chain (IGK) monoclonality testing. MYD88 L265P mutation was examined from anterior chamber tap samples. The diagnosis of VRL was made based on typical clinical characteristics for VRL, as well as malignant cytology, IGH/IGK clonality, or IL-10/IL-6 > 1. Sensitivity and specificity of NGS were compared with conventional diagnostic tests. Brain tissues suspected of lymphoma were collected by stereotactic biopsy and underwent NGS. Genetic variations detected in NGS of vitreous and brain tissue specimens were compared.The sensitivity values for cytology, IL-10/IL-6 > 1, clonality assays for IGH and IGK, MYD88 L265P detection in anterior chamber tap samples, and vitreous NGS were 0.23, 0.83, 0.68, 0.79, 0.67, and 0.85, with specificity values of 1.00, 0.83, 0.50, 0.25, 0.83, and 0.83, respectively. The sensitivity (0.85) of vitreous NGS was the highest compared to other conventional diagnostic tests for VRL. The most common mutations were MYD88 (91%), CDKN2A (36%), PIM1 (32%), IGLL5 (27%), and ETV6 (23%). Although several gene alterations demonstrated heterogeneity between the brain and eyes, some common mutational profiles were observed in matched vitreous and brain samples.Overall, NGS of the vitreous demonstrated high sensitivity among conventional diagnostic tests. VRL and CNSL appeared to have both shared and distinct genetic variations, which may suggest site-specific variations from a common origin.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"diagnostic, biomarker",,retinopathy,2
2023-11-20,37975849,Clinical Characteristics and Genetic Variants in Taiwanese Patients With PROM1-Related Inherited Retinal Disorders.,"This study investigated the clinical characteristics of patients with PROM1-related inherited retinal diseases (IRDs).Patients diagnosed with IRDs who had mutations in PROM1 were identified at Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital in Taiwan. Information on clinical characteristics and best-corrected visual acuity was recorded. Color fundus (CF) images, fundus autofluorescence photography (FAF), spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), and electroretinograms (ERGs) were analyzed to examine patient phenotypes. PROM1 variants were detected using whole exome sequencing and verified by Sanger sequencing.Fourteen patients from nine families with PROM1-related IRDs were analyzed. Most patients exhibited chorioretinal atrophy in the macular area, with or without extramacular involvement on CF. Similarly, hypo-autofluorescence confined to the macular area, with or without extramacular involvement, was present for most patients on FAF. Furthermore, SD-OCT revealed outer retinal tubulations and focal or diffuse retinal thinning. ERGs showed variable findings, including maculopathy with normal ERG, subnormal cone response, and extinguished rod and cone responses. We detected five variants of the PROM1 gene, including c.139del, c.794del, c.1238T>A, c.2110C>T, and c.1117C>T.In this study, we evaluated 14 Taiwanese patients with five PROM1 variants. Additionally, incomplete penetrance of heterozygous PROM1 variants was observed. Furthermore, patients with autosomal dominant PROM1 variants had lesions in the macular area and the peripheral region of the retina. SD-OCT serves as a useful tool for early detection of PROM1-related IRDs, as it captures certain signs of such diseases.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinal disease,2
2023-11-20,37979052,Molecular basis of retinal remodeling in a zebrafish model of retinitis pigmentosa.,"A hallmark of inherited retinal degenerative diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is progressive structural and functional remodeling of the remaining retinal cells as photoreceptors degenerate. Extensive remodeling of the retina stands as a barrier for the successful implementation of strategies to restore vision. To understand the molecular basis of remodeling, we performed analyses of single-cell transcriptome data from adult zebrafish retina of wild type AB strain (WT) and a P23H mutant rhodopsin transgenic model of RP with continuous degeneration and regeneration. Retinas from both female and male fish were pooled to generate each library, combining data from both sexes. We provide a benchmark atlas of retinal cell type transcriptomes in zebrafish and insight into how each retinal cell type is affected in the P23H model. Oxidative stress is found throughout the retina, with increases in reliance on oxidative metabolism and glycolysis in the affected rods as well as cones, bipolar cells, and retinal ganglion cells. There is also transcriptional evidence for widespread synaptic remodeling and enhancement of glutamatergic transmission in the inner retina. Notably, changes in circadian rhythm regulation are detected in cones, bipolar cells, and retinal pigmented epithelium. We also identify the transcriptomic signatures of retinal progenitor cells and newly formed rods essential for the regenerative process. This comprehensive transcriptomic analysis provides a molecular road map to understand how the retina remodels in the context of chronic retinal degeneration with ongoing regeneration.",no,yes,no,animal,biomarker,,"retinitis pigmentosa, retinal disease",2
2023-11-20,37980492,Altered fecal bile acid composition in active ulcerative colitis.,"Disturbed bile acid homeostasis associated with a rise of primary and a decline of secondary bile acids is a consistent finding in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Whether fecal bile acids may emerge as biomarkers for IBD diagnosis and disease severity is less clear. Our study aimed to identify associations of 18 fecal bile acid species with IBD entity and disease activity.Stool samples of 62 IBD patients and 17 controls were collected. Eighteen fecal bile acid species were quantified by LC-MS/MS using stable isotope dilution. Lipid levels normalized to a dry weight of the fecal homogenates and ratios of single bile acid species to total bile acid levels were used for calculations.IBD patients exhibited altered primary and secondary bile acid ratios in stool, with notable distinctions between ulcerative colitis (UC) compared to Crohn's disease (CD) and healthy controls. Fecal calprotectin was negatively correlated with glycolithocholic acid (GLCA) and hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA) in UC. These bile acids were reduced in stool of UC patients with fecal calprotectin levels > 500 µg/g compared to UC patients with low calprotectin levels. Moreover, negative associations of six secondary bile acids with C-reactive protein (CRP) existed in UC. In CD patients, fecal bile acids did not correlate with CRP or fecal calprotectin. Diarrhoea is common in IBD, and UC patients with diarrhoea had reduced deoxycholic acid (DCA), glycine conjugated DCA (GDCA) and lithocholic acid in stool in contrast to patients with normal stool consistency. Fecal bile acid levels were not associated with diarrhoea in CD patients. UC patients treated with mesalazine had increased levels of fecal GDCA whereas no such changes were observed in CD patients. Bile acid levels of CD and UC patients treated with biologicals or corticosteroids did not change. Relative levels of GHDCA (specificity: 79%, sensitivity: 67%) and glycochenodeoxycholic acid (specificity: 74%, sensitivity: 63%) were the most specific to distinguish UC from CD.Disrupted fecal bile acid homeostasis is associated with disease severity and disease symptoms in UC but not in CD, potentially aiding in distinguishing IBD subtypes and classifying the pathophysiology of diarrhoea in UC.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",2
2023-11-21,36594712,Retinal manifestations in autosomal recessive ,"To present the retinal and systemic findings in two siblings with compound heterozygous MPDZ variants that were found to have different chorioretinal manifestations. Materials and Methods: Two sibling patients underwent comprehensive ophthalmic examination, including ophthalmoscopy, fundus photography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and genetic testing by whole exome sequencing.A 4-year-old male presented with intermittent exotropia and decreased vision in both eyes. Ophthalmologic examination was notable for macular colobomas and far temporal chorioretinal atrophy in both eyes. OCT of the macula in both eyes demonstrated a caldera with severe retinal and choroidal thinning. Fluorescein angiography of the central macula showed hypofluorescence with persistence of deep choroidal vessels. An ocular gene panel was nondiagnostic, but subsequent whole-exome sequencing noted compound heterozygous, likely pathogenic MPDZ variants (c.3100C>T p.(Arg1034*) from father and c.747 + 2T>G p.(?) from mother). His older brother, a 9-year-old male, had a history of macrocephaly but had not undergone further workup. On exam, he had a visual acuity of 20/25 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left eye and was found to have subtle changes in the foveal reflex of both eyes. OCT revealed thinning of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) temporal to the fovea bilaterally. Sanger sequencing revealed he was positive for the same two MPDZ variants.MPDZ variants have been described in cases of congenital hydrocephalus with varying ophthalmologic manifestations.

2023-11-21,36602268,Is RPGR-related retinal dystrophy associated with systemic disease? A case series.,"Ciliopathies responsible for retinitis pigmentosa can also cause systemic manifestations. RPGR is a ciliary gene and pathogenic variants in RPGR cause a retinal ciliopathy, the commonest cause of X-linked recessive retinitis pigmentosa. The RPGR protein interacts with numerous other ciliary proteins present in the transition zone of both motile and sensory cilia, and may play an important role in regulating ciliary protein transport. There has been a growing, putative association of RPGR variants with systemic ciliopathies: mainly sino-respiratory infections and primary ciliary dyskinesia.Retrospective case series of patients with RPGR-RP presenting to Oxford Eye Hospital with systemic disease.We report three children with RPGR-related rod-cone dystrophy, all of whom have mutations in the N-terminus of RPGR. Two cases co-presented with confirmed diagnoses of primary ciliary dyskinesia and one case with multiple sino-respiratory symptoms strongly suggestive of primary ciliary dyskinesia. These and all previously reported RPGR co-pathologies relate to ciliopathies and have no other systemic associations.The link between RPGR variants and a systemic ciliopathy remains plausible, but currently unproven.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinal disease,2

Mydriatic standardized 5F imaging (macula, disc, superior, inferior, temporal) with handheld retinal camera was performed. 2F (disc, macula), and 5F images were independently assessed using the International DR classification at a centralized reading center. Simple (K) and weighted (Kw) kappa statistics were calculated for DR. Sensitivity and specificity for referable DR ([refDR] moderate nonproliferative DR [NPDR] or worse) and vision-threatening DR ([vtDR] severe NPDR or worse) for 2F compared to 5F imaging were calculated.Distribution of DR severity by 2F/5F images (%): no DR 66.0/61.7, mild NPDR 10.7/14.4, moderate NPDR 7.9/8.1, severe NPDR 3.3/5.6, proliferative DR 5.6/4.6, ungradable 6.5/5.6. Exact agreement of DR grading between 2F and 5F was 81.7%, within 1-step 97.1% (K = 0.64, Kw = 0.78). Sensitivity/specificity for 2F compared 5F was refDR 0.80/0.97, vtDR 0.73/0.98. The ungradable images rate with 2F was 16.1% higher than with 5F (6.5 vs. 5.6%, p &lt; 0.001).Mydriatic 2F and 5F handheld imaging have substantial agreement in assessing severity of DR. However, the use of mydriatic 2F handheld imaging only meets the minimum standards for sensitivity and specificity for refDR but not for vtDR. When using handheld cameras, the addition of peripheral fields in 5F imaging further refines the referral approach by decreasing ungradable rate and increasing sensitivity for vtDR.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,diagnostic,,retinopathy,2
2023-11-21,37453981,The diagnostic value of global longitudinal strain combined with cardiac biomarkers on early detection of anthracycline-related cardiac dysfunction.,"Cardiac dysfunction associated with anthracyclines is a significant side effect of chemotherapy, and early detection is crucial. We aimed to assess the diagnostic value of combining global longitudinal strain (GLS) with biomarkers for the early detection of anthracycline-related cardiac dysfunction.In a prospective cohort study, 80 consecutive adult patients (mean age 51 ± 11 years; 68.8% females) were screened and underwent 2D echocardiographic assessments and biomarker assessments [high-sensitivity troponin-I (hs-Troponin-I) and NT-pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)] before and after anthracycline-based chemotherapy's initial regimen. The patients were followed up for 12 weeks to monitor for the development of cardiotoxicity.Ten patients (12.5%) developed cardiotoxicity at the end of the 12-week follow-up. Baseline values of hs-Troponin-I and NT-proBNP were significantly higher in patients who developed cardiotoxicity compared to those who did not, with a similar pattern observed at the 3-week follow-up. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated that a cutoff value of baseline hs-Troponin-I > 11 ng/L, NT-proBNP > 90.1 pg/mL, 3-week left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 52%, 3-week GLS ≥ - 14.5%, 3-week hs-Troponin-I > 13.1 ng/L, and 3-week NT-proBNP > 118.1 pg/mL predicted the occurrence of cardiotoxicity with high sensitivity (range 83-94%) and specificity (range 77-92%).Combination of GLS with biomarkers had a high diagnostic value in early identification of anthracycline-related cardiac dysfunction, with an estimated diagnostic accuracy of over 85%. This information could potentially help in the identification of patients at high risk of developing cardiac dysfunction, allowing for earlier management.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,diagnostic,natriuretic,,2

After quality control, 1108 eyes from 694 participants with HM were included in the normative database; 459 eyes from 408 participants (323 eyes with HM and 136 eyes with HMG) and 322 eyes from 197 participants (131 eyes with HM and 191 eyes with HMG) were included in the internal and external validation sets, respectively. Only HMG eyes with an intraocular pressure > 21 mmHg were included.The pRNFL thickness was measured with swept-source (SS) OCT. Four strategies of pRNFL-specified values were examined, including global and quadrantic pRNFL thickness below the lowest fifth or the lowest first percentile of the normative database.The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the HM-specific normative database for detecting HMG.Setting the fifth percentile of the global pRNFL thickness as the threshold, using the HM-specific normative database, we achieved an accuracy of 0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90-0.95) and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.81-0.89), and, using the first percentile as the threshold, we acheived an accuracy of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.81-0.88) and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.65-0.75) in detecting HMG in the internal and external validation sets, respectively. The fifth percentile of the global pRNFL thickness achieved high sensitivities of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.67-0.82) and 0.75 (95% CI, 0.68-0.81) and specificities of 1.00 (95% CI, 0.99-1.00) and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.97-1.00) in the internal and external validation datasets, respectively. Compared with the built-in database of the OCT device, the HM-specific normative database showed a higher sensitivity and specificity than the corresponding pRNFL thickness below the fifth or first percentile (P < 0.001 for all).The HM-specific normative database is more capable of detecting HMG eyes than the SS OCT built-in database, which may be an effective tool for differential diagnosis between HMG and HM.Proprietary or commercial disclosure may be found in the Footnotes and Disclosures at the end of this article.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,diagnostic,,"retinopathy, retinal disease",2
2023-11-21,37573773,Clinical and Diagnostic Findings of Acute Macular Neuroretinopathy and Paracentral Acute Middle Maculopathy in the COVID-19 Era.,"Growing evidence suggests an association between the infection from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and eye disorders. The aim of this review was to analyze the clinical presentation and diagnostic features of acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN) and paracentral acute middle maculopathy (PAMM) associated with COVID-19 infection. The features are then compared with previous reports regarding these retinal disorders, to recognize possible specific characteristics and to assess the role of multimodal ophthalmic imaging.A literature search was performed by consulting PubMed, Scopus, and Embase. The following terms were searched: ""(COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR coronavirus) AND ([acute macular neuroretinopathy] OR [paracentral acute middle maculopathy])."" Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) publication date from January 31, 2020 to January 31, 2022; (2) English language; (3) original research or case report; (4) free full-text availability.Optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings in AMN patients were hyper-reflectivity (HR) of the outer plexiform layer, of the outer nuclear layer, and ellipsoid or interdigitation zones (EZ and IZ, respectively) disruption. In most cases, the presence of HR and EZ/IZ abnormalities resulted combined. When performed, OCT angiography (OCTA) identified attenuation of signal of the deep capillary plexus (DCP). The most common OCT finding in PAMM was an alteration of the inner nuclear layer, associated with other areas of HR, while no signs of EZ/IZ disruption were detected. When performed, OCTA showed the attenuation of signal of both the DCP and the superficial capillary plexus.In this review, we reported a case series of AMN and PAMM in patients with a previous or concomitant infection from SARS-CoV-2. The microvascular changes in these cases are highlighted by the OCTA scans. Even if we are far from the determination of a direct link between COVID-19 and these retinal disorders, we could hypothesize that the vascular alterations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection could be a possible risk factor for both AMN and PAMM.",no,yes,no,other,diagnostic,,retinopathy,2
2023-11-21,37579856,Severity of Nocturia and Constipation in Patients With Ulcerative Colitis.,"To investigate the association between nocturia and constipation in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Constipation has recently been recognized as an important symptom in patients with UC. Although nocturia has been associated with constipation in the general population, the association between nocturia and constipation in UC patients is uncertain.Consecutive series of 290 Japanese patients with UC, Information on constipation, nocturia, and lifestyle habits was obtained using self-administered questionnaires. The definition of constipation was based on Rome I criteria and/or current medication for constipation. Patients were divided into three groups based on nighttime urination: (1) no nocturia, (2) mild nocturia (nocturnal urination - one), and (3) serious nocturia (nocturnal urination - two or more). Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between nocturia and constipation.Among all of the UC patients, the prevalence of mild nocturia, serious nocturia, and constipation was 35.2%, 26.9%, and 12.4%, respectively. The prevalence of constipation in the none, mild, and serious nocturia groups was 8.2%, 10.8%, and 20.5%, respectively. After adjustment for confounders such as age, sex, current drinking, current smoking, body mass index, and steroid use, nocturia severity was independently and positively associated with constipation (adjusted odds ratio for mild nocturia: 1.55 [95% confidence interval: 0.57-4.28], serious nocturia: 3.19 [95% confidence interval: 1.09-9.81], P for trend=.035).The severity of nocturia is positively associated with constipation, and physicians should consider the interrelationships between nocturia and constipation in managing UC patients.",no,yes,no,other,biomarker,,ulcerative colitis,2

Also, the association of this system with many diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, cancer, diabetic retinopathy, etc., has been determined. This system is considered a therapeutic goal in many mentioned diseases. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have the ability to form oligomers and dimers with themselves and other receptors. The formation of these oligomers is associated with a change in the signaling pathways of the receptors. Research on the oligo and dimers of these receptors can revolutionize the principles of pharmacology.

This study examined the tubulopathy-causing genes for ocular associations that suggested their genetic basis and, in some cases, the affected gene.Sixty-seven genes from the Genomics England renal tubulopathy panel were reviewed for ocular features, and for retinal expression in the Human Protein Atlas and an ocular phenotype in mouse models in the Mouse Genome Informatics database. The genes resulted in disease affecting the proximal tubules (n = 24); the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (n = 10); the distal convoluted tubule (n = 15); or the collecting duct (n = 18).Twenty-five of the tubulopathy-associated genes (37%) had ocular features reported in human disease, 49 (73%) were expressed in the retina, although often at low levels, and 16 (24%) of the corresponding mouse models had an ocular phenotype. Ocular abnormalities were more common in genes affected in the proximal tubulopathies (17/24, 71%) than elsewhere (7/43, 16%). They included structural features (coloboma, microphthalmia); refractive errors (myopia, astigmatism); crystal deposition (in oxalosis, cystinosis) and sclerochoroidal calcification (in Bartter, Gitelman syndromes). Retinal atrophy was common in the mitochondrial-associated tubulopathies. Structural abnormalities and crystal deposition were present from childhood, but sclerochoroidal calcification typically occurred after middle age.Ocular abnormalities are uncommon in the genetic tubulopathies but may be helpful in recognizing the underlying genetic disease. The retinal expression and mouse phenotype data suggest that further ocular associations may become apparent with additional reports.

2023-11-21,37721532,Circulating MicroRNAs as Biomarker for Vessel-Associated Retinal Diseases.,"Vessel-associated retinal diseases are a major cause of blindness and severe visual impairment. The identification of appropriate biomarkers is of great importance to better anticipate disease progression and establish more targeted treatment options. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, single-stranded, noncoding ribonucleic acids that are involved in the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression through hybridization with messenger RNA. The expression of certain miRNAs can be different in patients with pathological processes and can be used for the detection and differentiation of various diseases. In this study, we investigate to what extent previously in vitro identified miRNAs are present as cell-free circulating miRNAs in the serum and vitreous of human patients with and without vessel-associated retinal diseases.Relative quantification by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze miRNA expression in patients with vessel-associated retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), and retinal vein occlusion compared with control patients.In serum samples, miR-29a-3p and miR-192-5p showed increased expression in patients with neovascular AMD relative to control patients. Similarly, miR-335-5p, miR-192-5p, and miR-194-5p showed increased expression in serum from patients with proliferative DR. In vitreous samples, miR-100-5p was decreased in patients with proliferative DR. Differentially expressed miRNAs showed good diagnostic accuracy in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under the ROC curve analysis.The miRNAs investigated in this study may have the potential to serve as biomarkers for vessel-associated retinal diseases.

Surprisingly, genetic testing revealed compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in GNPTG, leading to the diagnosis of the autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder mucolipidosis type III gamma. Mucolipidosis type III gamma is typically diagnosed during childhood due to symptoms relating to skeletal dysplasia. Retinal dystrophy is not a common phenotypic feature.Ophthalmologic examination was consistent with a mild form of retinitis pigmentosa and included fundus photography, measurement of best-corrected visual acuity, optical coherence tomography, electroretinogram and visual field testing. Extraocular findings included joint restriction and pains from an early age leading to bilateral hip replacement by age 30, aortic insufficiency, and hypertension. Genetic analysis was performed by whole genome sequencing filtered for a gene panel of 325 genes associated with retinal disease. Two compound heterozygous pathogenic variants were identified in GNPTG, c.347_349del and c.607dup. The diagnosis of mucolipidosis type III gamma was confirmed biochemically by measurement of increased activities of specific lysosomal enzymes in plasma.To our knowledge this is the first description of retinitis pigmentosa caused by compound heterozygous variants in GNPTG, providing further indications that late-onset retinal dystrophy is part of the phenotypic spectrum of mucolipidosis type III gamma.",no,yes,no,other,"diagnostic, biomarker",,"retinitis pigmentosa, retinal disease",2

This review provides an accessible and practical explanation of CNNs for clinicians and highlights their relevance in medical image analysis. CNNs have shown themselves to be exceptionally useful in computer vision, a field that enables machines to 'see' and interpret visual data. Understanding how these models work can help clinicians leverage their full potential, especially as artificial intelligence continues to evolve and integrate into healthcare. CNNs have already demonstrated their efficacy in diverse medical fields, including radiology, histopathology, and medical photography. In radiology, CNNs have been used to automate the assessment of conditions such as pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and rectal cancer. In histopathology, CNNs have been used to assess and classify colorectal polyps, gastric epithelial tumours, as well as assist in the assessment of multiple malignancies. In medical photography, CNNs have been used to assess retinal diseases and skin conditions, and to detect gastric and colorectal polyps during endoscopic procedures. In surgical laparoscopy, they may provide intraoperative assistance to surgeons, helping interpret surgical anatomy and demonstrate safe dissection zones. The integration of CNNs into medical image analysis promises to enhance diagnostic accuracy, streamline workflow efficiency, and expand access to expert-level image analysis, contributing to the ultimate goal of delivering further improvements in patient and healthcare outcomes.",no,yes,no,not a study,diagnostic,,retinal disease,2
2023-11-21,37797661,CircRNA in ocular neovascular diseases: Fundamental mechanism and clinical potential.,"Ocular neovascular disease (OND), characterized by the aberrant formation of immature blood vessels, is the leading cause of vision impairment and blindness. It is important to find effective ways to diagnose and treat these diseases. Circular RNA (circRNA) is a group of endogenous non-coding RNA that play a crucial role in regulating different biological processes. Due to their close association with ocular disease and angiogenesis, circRNAs have become a hotspot in OND research. In this review, we intensively investigate the possibility of using circRNAs in the management of ONDs. In general, angiogenesis is divided into five phases. On the basis of these five steps, we describe the potential of using circRNAs by introducing how they regulate angiogenesis. Subsequently, the interactions between circRNAs and ONDs, including pterygium, corneal neovascularization, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and retinopathy of prematurity, are analyzed in detail. We also introduce the potential use of circRNAs as OND diagnostic biomarkers. Finally, we summarize the prospects of using circRNAs as a potential strategy in OND management. The gaps in recent research are also pointed out with the purpose of promoting the introduction of circRNAs into clinical applications.",no,yes,no,other,"diagnostic, biomarker",,retinopathy,2
2023-11-21,37981354,AGA Clinical Practice Guideline on the Role of Biomarkers for the Management of Crohn's Disease.,"Biomarkers are used frequently for evaluation and monitoring of patients with Crohn's disease (CD). This American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guideline is intended to support practitioners in decisions about the use of biomarkers for the management of CD.A multidisciplinary panel of content experts and guideline methodologists used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework to formulate patient-centered clinical questions and review evidence on the performance of fecal calprotectin, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), and Endoscopic Healing Index in patients with established CD who were asymptomatic, had symptoms of varying severity, or were in surgically induced remission. Biomarker performance was assessed against the gold standard of endoscopic activity, defined as a Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease ≥3. The panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation Evidence-to-Decision framework to develop recommendations for use of biomarkers in various settings. Implementation considerations were formulated for each recommendation to inform clinical practice.The guideline panel made 11 conditional recommendations. In patients with CD in symptomatic remission, the panel suggests use of a biomarker- and symptom-based monitoring strategy over symptoms alone. In patients in symptomatic remission, a fecal calprotectin <150 μg/g and normal CRP rules out active inflammation, avoiding endoscopic evaluation for assessment of disease activity. However, elevated biomarkers in this setting merit confirmation with endoscopy before treatment adjustment. In patients with CD with mild symptoms, neither normal nor elevated biomarkers alone are sufficiently accurate to determine endoscopic activity. In patients with CD with moderate to severe symptoms, elevated fecal calprotectin or serum CRP suggests endoscopic activity, precluding routine endoscopic assessment for disease activity. In patients with CD in surgically induced remission in low-risk patients on pharmacologic prophylaxis, a normal fecal calprotectin reliably rules out endoscopic recurrence. In other postoperative settings, the panel suggests endoscopic assessment for establishing postoperative recurrence.In patients with CD, fecal calprotectin and serum CRP can inform disease management in both asymptomatic and symptomatic disease. Discordance between symptom assessment and biomarker value may merit endoscopic evaluation for confirmation of status of disease activity.",no,yes,no,other,biomarker,,crohn's disease,2

This report highlights isolated cone dysfunction as an alternative RPGRIP1-related presenting phenotype.Retrospective case series.Four individuals (two sibships from two unrelated families) had low vision, nystagmus, photophobia, and a grossly normal retinal appearance since soon after birth. ERG confirmed non-recordable photopic function with normal scotopic function. Genetic testing revealed affected members from the two families to harbor two different homozygous RPGRIP1 variants (Family 1: c.3565C>T; p.Arg1189*; Family 2: c.2711_2741delinsATATTAG; p.Gly904_Lys914delinsAspIIeArg). Follow-up for Family 1 revealed deterioration of pan-retinal function (non-recordable ERGs by 11 and 7 years old) and thus a final diagnosis of cone-rod dystrophy. Follow-up for Family 2 showed stable retinal function (normal ERG scotopic tracings maintained at 12 and 21 years old) and thus a diagnosis of isolated cone dysfunction.Isolated cone dysfunction that progresses to pan-retinal dysfunction or remains relatively stationary is an alternative phenotype related to biallelic RPGRIP1 pathogenic variants.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,diagnostic,,retinal disease,2
2023-11-22,37026783,Intraoperative Fluorescein Angiography Can Efficiently Identify Biomarkers and Guide Surgical Decision-Making.,"We sought to develop an efficient method for fluorescein angiography (FA) during digitally assisted vitreoretinal surgery (DAVS).A 485-nm bandpass filter was placed into the filter holder of the accessory light sources of the Constellation Vision System with steel modified washers to produce an exciter source. A barrier filter was placed into the blank slot of a switchable laser filter with a 535-nm bandpass filter and another washer or created digitally with a specific color channel using NGENUITY software version 1.4. Fluorescein, 250 to 500 mg, was then injected intravenously during retinal surgery.These fluorescence patterns accurately detect many fluorescein angiography biomarkers, such as determination of vascular filling times, ischemia, neovascularization, shunt vessels, microaneurysms, and leakage into the vitreous. This enhanced surgical visualization permitted intervention in real time such as laser or diathermy to residual microvascular abnormalities after delamination of retinal neovascularization as well as heavier panretinal laser placement in areas of retinal capillary dropout to relatively preserve areas of more intact retinal microcirculation.The authors of this study are the first to report an efficient method that permits high-resolution detection of many classic FA biomarkers such as during DAVS to enhance surgical visualization and intervention in real time.",no,yes,no,other,biomarker,,"retinopathy, retinal disease",2
2023-11-22,37460671,HLA-DQA1*05 and upstream variants of PPARGC1B are associated with infliximab persistence in Japanese Crohn's disease patients.,"Recently, the HLA-DQA1*05 (rs2097432) genetic variation has been reported to be linked to early infliximab (IFX) treatment failure in the Caucasian Crohn's disease (CD) population, but that evidence is scarce in the Asian population. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between rs2097432 and the cumulative discontinuation-free time of IFX (IFX persistence) in 189 Japanese biologics-naive CD patients. We also performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to discover novel genetic predictors for IFX persistence. The C allele of rs2097432 significantly increased the risk of early discontinuation of IFX [Hazard ratio (HR) = 2.23 and P-value = 0.026]. In GWAS, one locus tagged by rs73277969, located upstream of PPARGC1B which attenuates macrophage-mediated inflammation, reached genome-wide significance (HR = 6.04 and P-value = 7.93E-9). Pathway analysis suggested association of signaling by PDGF and FCGR activation signaling with IFX persistence (P-value = 8.56E-5 and 5.80E-4, respectively).",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,crohn's disease,2
2023-11-22,37547943,Correlation of ex vivo cytokine secretion profiles with scoring indices in ulcerative colitis.,"In ulcerative colitis, the complexity of mucosal cytokine secretion profiles and how they correlate with endoscopic and clinical scores is still unclear.In this study, we collected fresh biopsies from UC patients to investigate which cytokines are produced in ex vivo culture conditions, a platform increasingly used for testing of novel drugs. Then, we correlated cytokine production with several scoring indices commonly used to assess the severity of the disease.Increased levels of IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, TNFα and IFNɣ were produced by biopsies of UC patients compared to non-IBD controls. Our results show a better correlation of cytokine levels with Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) and Mayo score, than the more complex Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS). Out of 10 measured cytokines, eight correlated with MES, six with Mayo score and only three with UCEIS, due to the partial increase in cytokine secretion observed in donors with UCEIS = 7-8. When we analysed individual subscores within the UCEIS, Vascular Network subscore showed a correlation similar to MES (7/10 cytokines), while Bleeding as well as Erosions and Ulcers subscores correlated with only 3/10 cytokines, similarly to the total UCEIS.Our findings suggest that choosing biopsies from donors with MES = 2-3 and UCEIS = 2-6 from areas with no bleeding and no superficial and/or deep ulcers could enable a deeper insight into the cytokine profile of the inflamed tissue and represent a better tool for studying potential therapeutic targets and evaluation of novel therapies.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,ulcerative colitis,2
2023-11-22,37725903,Structural and Metabolic Retinal Changes Associated With Mild Cognitive Impairment in Type 2 Diabetes.,"Type 2 diabetes is associated with cognitive impairment and a twofold increased risk of dementia compared with age-matched individuals without diabetes. Given that the eye and the brain share similar embryologic origin and anatomical features, the retina offers a unique window to the brain. In this study, we wanted to determine whether there was a difference in retinal imaging-based neuronal and vascular markers in individuals with type 2 diabetes with or without mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We included 134 persons with type 2 diabetes. Based on neuropsychological tests, the prevalence of MCI was 28%. We performed seven-field color fundus photos, optical coherence tomography (OCT), OCT-angiography (OCT-A), and retinal oximetry to analyze retinal markers. In a multivariable cluster analysis, persons with MCI had a significantly thinner macular retinal nerve fiber layer and macular ganglion cell layer, and less venular oxygen saturation in the nasal quadrant compared with those without MCI. There were no differences in retinal vessel density, fractal dimension, width, tortuosity, or OCT-A markers. People with type 2 diabetes and MCI demonstrate alterations in retinal structure and metabolism, suggesting noninvasive retinal markers may be useful to detect people with type 2 diabetes at risk for cognitive dysfunction.Type 2 diabetes is associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Therefore, retinal and cerebral neurodegeneration may run in parallel. To assess whether there was a difference in retinal structure, vessel, and metabolic parameters in individuals with MCI.

2023-11-22,37788937,Clinical Reasoning: A Woman With Progressive Painless Sequential Monocular Vision Loss.,"A 68-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, depression, and migraines presented with painless, acute, consecutive vision loss affecting the right eye for 1 week and the left eye for 2 weeks. Neuro-ophthalmic examination was notable for visual acuities of finger-counting peripherally, a central scotoma, anterior uveitis, vitritis, and placoid macular pigmentary changes in each eye (OU). Proprioception was diminished in the bilateral lower extremities. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed hyper-reflectivity and attenuation of the outer retina OU with normal inner retinal architecture and reflectivity. Fluorescein angiography (FA) demonstrated normal filling of the central retinal arteries with patchy choroidal perfusion in the right eye and targetoid punctate foci of leakage in the macula OU. Before the recognition of intraocular inflammation and findings on OCT and FA, the patient was treated for presumed central retinal artery occlusion at an outside hospital. Additional diagnostic testing at our institution revealed an alternate diagnosis.

2023-11-22,37831228,Retinal Changes in Parkinson's Disease: A Non-invasive Biomarker for Early Diagnosis.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused due to degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) which leads to the depletion of dopamine in the body. The lack of dopamine is mainly due to aggregation of misfolded α-synuclein which causes motor impairment in PD. Dopamine is also required for normal retinal function and the light-dark vision cycle. Misfolded α-synuclein present in inner retinal layers causes vision-associated problems in PD patients. Hence, individuals with PD also experience structural and functional changes in the retina. Mutation in LRRK2, PARK2, PARK7, PINK1, or SNCA genes and mitochondria dysfunction also play a role in the pathophysiology of PD. In this review, we discussed the different etiologies which lead to PD and future prospects of employing non-invasive techniques and retinal changes to diagnose the onset of PD earlier.",no,yes,yes,other,biomarker,,"retinopathy, retinal disease",2
2023-11-22,37838103,Emerging links between FOXOs and diabetic complications.,"Diabetes and its complications are increasing worldwide in the working population as well as in elders. Prolonged hyperglycemia results in damage to blood vessels of various tissues followed by organ damage. Hyperglycemia-induced damage in small blood vessels as in nephrons, retina, and neurons results in diabetic microvascular complications which involve nephropathy, retinopathy, and diabetic neuropathy. Additionally, damage in large blood vessels is considered as a macrovascular complication including diabetic cardiomyopathy. These long-term complications can result in organ failure and thus becomes the leading cause of diabetic-related mortality in patients. Members of the Forkhead Box O family (FOXO) are involved in various body functions including cell proliferation, metabolic processes, differentiation, autophagy, and apoptosis. Moreover, increasing shreds of evidence suggest the involvement of FOXO family members FOXO1, FOXO3, FOXO4, and FOXO6 in several chronic diseases including diabetes and diabetic complications.

2023-11-22,37988107,Deep Learning-Facilitated Study of the Rate of Change in Photoreceptor Outer Segment Metrics in RPGR-Related X-Linked Retinitis Pigmentosa.,"The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to obtain three-dimensional (3D) photoreceptor outer segment (OS) metrics measurements with the assistance of a deep learning model (DLM) and to evaluate the longitudinal change in OS metrics and associated factors in retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR) X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP).The study included 34 male patients with RPGR-associated XLRP who had preserved ellipsoid zone (EZ) within their spectral-domain optical coherence tomography volume scans and an approximate 2-year or longer follow-up. Volume scans were segmented using a DLM with manual correction for EZ and apical retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). OS metrics were measured from 3D EZ-RPE layers of volume scans. Linear mixed-effects models were used to calculate the rate of change in OS metrics and the associated factors, including baseline age, baseline OS metrics, and follow-up duration.The mean (standard deviation) of progression rates were -0.28 (0.43) µm/y, -0.73 (0.61) mm2/y, and -0.014 (0.012) mm3/y for OS thickness, EZ area, and OS volume, respectively. In multivariable analysis, the progression rates of EZ area and OS volume were strongly associated with their baseline values, with faster decline in eyes with larger baseline values (P ≤ 0.003), and nonlinearly associated with the baseline age (P ≤ 0.003). OS thickness decline was not associated with its baseline value (P = 0.32).These results provide evidence to support using OS metrics as biomarkers to assess the progression of XLRP and as the outcome measures of clinical trials. Given that their progression rates are dependent on their baseline values, the baseline EZ area and OS volume should be considered in the design and statistical analysis of future clinical trials. Deep learning may provide a useful tool to reduce the burden of human graders to analyze OCT scan images and to facilitate the assessment of disease progression and treatment trials for retinitis pigmentosa.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinal disease,2

This study aimed to explore biomarkers for DR that may provide additional reference to DR pathogenesis and development.The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the DR and control samples in the GSE53257 dataset were identified. Logistics analyses were performed to identify DR-associated miRNAs and genes, and correlation analysis was performed to determine the correlation between them in GSE160306.A total of 114 DEGs in DR were identified in GSE53257. Three genes, including ATP5A1 (down), DAUFV2 (down), and OXA1L (down), were differentially expressed between DR and control samples in GSE160306. Univariate logistics analysis identified that ATP5A1 (OR=0.007, p = 1.40E-02), NDUFV2 (OR = 0.003, p = 6.40E-03), and OXA1L (OR = 0.093, p = 3.08E-02) were DR-associated genes.

We divided small and large bowels into seven segments, and recorded the presence of active inflammation according to following criteria: bowel wall thickness ≥ mm with ≥1 of feature of active disease on IUS. The correlations between IUS-assessed activity and serum C-reactive protein (CRP, mg/dL) and fecal calprotectin (FC, μg/g) levels were analyzed.A total of 127 patients were included (mean age: 32.42 ± 12.07, M:F = 90:37, median disease duration 6 years [0-35]). Of them, 78 showed active bowel inflammation (61.4%), with inflammation distal to the terminal ileum being the most common disease location (n = 61, 78.2%). FC and serum CRP levels were significantly correlated with the number of segments with active inflammation (rho = 0.58, 0.48), number of segments with complications (r = 0.35, 0.31), and US activity score (r = 0.62, 0.54). With FC cutoff values of 100 and 150 μg/g, the concordance rates for patients with active small bowel disease were 78.7% (26/33) and 72.7% (24/33), respectively, which were better than those for other disease locations.Disease activity determined by IUS was significantly correlated with the biomarkers, with a better concordance rate in patients with active small bowel disease than in those with other disease locations with FC cut-off values of 100 and 150 μg/g.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,crohn's disease,2

Nevertheless, the role of echocardiography in these patients is incompletely determined. We evaluated the right ventricular function using 'non-conventional' markers of RVd/PO in patients with APE.This was a prospective, single-arm, single-centre study. Consecutive adult patients hospitalised for APE were included. The RV free wall longitudinal strain (RV-FWLS), the fractional area change (FAC), the ratio tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE)/pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PASP), and the pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) were evaluated.One hundred patients (mean age 70.0 ± 13.9 years, female 48%) were screened and 73 had adequate RV-FWLS images. The most common abnormal echocardiographic marker was RV-FWLS (44/73; p < 0.001, for all other echocardiographic indices). Thirty-one patients had either PASP ≥ 36 mmHg or PVR > 2 WU (49.2% of the patients with both indices available). There were significant correlations between RV-FWLS, TAPSE/PASP and PVR with both D-Dimers and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and between FAC and BNP. RF-FWLS differed significantly between patients with a simplified pulmonary embolism severity index (sPESI) score 0 and those with a score ≥1 (p < 0.001).RVd/PO coexists with APE in a large proportion of patients.

In this study, we aim to elucidate the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis at the single-cell level and unveil its clinical significance. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and high-dimensional weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we identify a subpopulation of plasma cells (PCs) with significantly increased infiltration in UC colonic mucosa, characterized by pronounced oxidative stress. Combining 10 machine learning approaches, we find that the PC oxidative stress genes accurately distinguish diseased mucosa from normal mucosa (independent external testing AUC=0.991, sensitivity=0.986, specificity=0.909). Using MCPcounter and non-negative matrix factorization, we identify the association between PC oxidative stress genes and immune cell infiltration as well as patient heterogeneity. Spatial transcriptome data is used to verify the infiltration of oxidatively stressed PCs in colitis. Finally, we develop a gene-immune convolutional neural network deep learning model to diagnose UC mucosa in different cohorts (independent external testing AUC=0.984, sensitivity=95.9%, specificity=100%).

2023-11-23,37947776,Novel Approaches for Elongation of Fish Oils into Very-Long-Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids and Their Enzymatic Interesterification into Glycerolipids.,"Elongation of the Very-Long-Chain Fatty Acids-4 (ELOVL4) enzyme that is expressed in neuronal tissues, sperm, and testes mediates biosynthesis of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLC-PUFAs) from dietary long chain PUFAs (LC-PUFAs). The VLC-PUFAs are critical for neuronal and reproductive function. Therefore, mutations in ELOVL4 that affect VLC-PUFA biosynthesis contribute to retinal degenerative diseases including Autosomal Dominant Stargardt-like Macular Dystrophy (STGD3). Recent studies have also shown not only a depletion of retinal VLC-PUFAs with normal aging but also a more significant loss of VLC-PUFAs in donor eyes of patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). However, currently, there are no natural sources of VLC-PUFAs to be evaluated as dietary supplements for the attenuation of retinal degeneration in animal models of STGD3. Here, we report the development of a novel chemical approach for elongation of eicosapentaenoic (C20:5 n-3) and docosahexaenoic (C22:6 n-3) acids from fish oils by 6 carbon atoms to make a unique group of VLC-PUFAs, namely all-cis-hexacosa-11,14,17,20,23-pentaenoic acids (C26:5 n-3) and all-cis-octacosa-10,13,16,19,22,25-hexaenoic acids (C28:6 n-3). The three-step elongation approach that we report herein resulted in a good overall yield of up to 20.2%. This more sustainable approach also resulted in improved functional group compatibility and minimal impact on the geometrical integrity of the all-cis double bond system of the VLC-PUFAs. In addition, we also successfully used commercial deep-sea fish oil concentrate as an inexpensive material for the C6 elongation of fish oil LC-PUFAs into VLC-PUFAs, which resulted in the making of gram scales of VLC-PUFAs with an even higher isolation yield of 31.0%. The quality of fish oils and the content of oxidized lipids were key since both strongly affected the activity of the PEPPSI-IPr catalyst and ultimately the yield of coupling reactions. Downstream enzymatic interesterification was used for the first time to prepare structured glycerolipids enriched with VLC-PUFAs that could be evaluated in vivo to determine absorption and transport to target tissues relative to those of the free fatty acid forms. It turned out that in the synthesis of structured triacylglycerols and glycerophospholipids with VLC-PUFAs, the polarity of the immobilized lipase carrier and its humidity were essential.",no,yes,no,other,biomarker,,retinal disease,2

However, the detailed genetic basis, causality, and direction of this association remain unclear.Bidirectional two-sample Mendelian Randomization [MR] analysis was conducted using summary statistics from published genome-wide association studies. Bayesian Colocalization and multivariable MR [MVMR] analyses were performed to identify candidate variants and risk genes involved in the shared genetic basis between IBD, psoriasis, and their subtypes.Genetically predicted IBD and Crohn's disease [CD] were associated with an increased risk of psoriasis, psoriasis vulgaris [PsV], and psoriatic arthritis [PsA] (IBD on psoriasis: pooled odds ratio [OR] 1.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.14, p = .0001; CD on psoriasis: pooled OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.06-1.15, p < .0001) and vice versa (psoriasis on IBD: pooled OR 1.11, 95%CI 1.02-1.21), whereas CD only exhibited a unidirectional association with psoriasis. Colocalization analysis revealed eight candidate genetic variants and risk genes (including LINC00824, CDKAL1, IL10, IL23R, DNAJC27, LPP, RUNX3, and RGS14) associated with a shared genetic basis. Among these, IL23R, DNAJC27, LPP, and RGS14 were further validated by MVMR analysis.Our findings indicated bidirectional causal associations between IBD and psoriasis (including PsV and PsA), which were attributed primarily to CD rather than Ulcerative colitis [UC].

2023-11-24,36130816,Electroretinographic findings in retinal vasculitis.,"To describe and correlate electroretinographic responses with clinical and angiographic findings in retinal vasculitis (RV).Medical records of patients with diagnosis of RV at a tertiary eye centre from December 2017 to May 2021 were reviewed. Cases in which fluorescein angiography (FFA) and full field electroretinography (ffERG) were done within 1 month were included. FFAs were graded according to the Angiography Scoring for Uveitis Working Group from 0 to 40, where 0 is normal. A novel ffERG grading system was implemented where individual waves were graded for timing and amplitude and general ffERG score was determined with 6 being a perfect score.20 patients (34 eyes) were included. Mean age was 43.9±19.8 years; 70% were female. Median best-corrected visual acuity was 0.8 (0.08-1). Mean FFA score was 12.6±6.5. Median general ffERG score was 5 (0-6). 68% and 91% of eyes had responses with general ffERG scores ≥5 and 4, respectively. Flicker timing was most commonly affected.FFA scores weakly correlated with delayed photopic cone b-wave and flicker timing (p=0.03 and 0.016, respectively). Vitreous haze moderately correlated with delayed cone b-wave timing (p<0.001), delayed flicker timing (p=0.002) and weakly correlated with lower flicker amplitude (p=0.03). Underlying systemic disease was associated with poor ffERG responses.In this study, RV was not frequently associated with severe global retinal dysfunction Higher FFA scores, and vitreous haze grading were weakly, but significantly, correlated with cone-generated ffERG responses.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,diagnostic,,retinopathy,2
2023-11-24,36216411,Prevalence and risk factors for age-related macular degeneration in a population-based cohort study of older adults in Northern Ireland using multimodal imaging: NICOLA Study.,"To report prevalence and risk factor associations for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and AMD features from multimodal retinal grading in a multidisciplinary longitudinal population-based study of aging in Northern Ireland.Population-based longitudinal cohort study.Retinal imaging at the Norther Ireland Cohort for the Longitudinal Aging Study health assessment included stereo Colour Fundus Photography (CFP) (Canon CX-1, Tokyo, Japan) and Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) ((Heidelberg Retinal Angopgraph (HRA)+OCT; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany). Medical history and demographic information was obtained during a home interview. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the prevalence of AMD and individual AMD features. Multiple imputation followed by multiple regression modelling was used to explore risk factor associations including relationships with AMD genetic risk score.Retinal images from 3386 participants were available for analysis. Mean age of the sample was 63.4 (SD 9.01, range: 36-99). Population weighted prevalence of AMD using colour grading in those over 55 years was: no drusen: 6 0.4%; drusen <63 μm: 15.9%; drusen 63-125 µm: 13.7%; drusen >125 µm or pigmentary changes: 8.3%; late AMD: 1.6%. Prevalence of AMD features in those over 55 years was: OCT drusen 27.5%, complete outer retinal pigment epithelium and outer retinal atrophy (cRORA) on OCT was 4.3%, reticular drusen 3.2% and subretinal drusenoid deposits 25.7%. The genetic risk score was significantly associated with drusen and cRORA but less so for SDD alone and non-significant for hyperpigmentation or vitelliform lesions.Multimodal imaging-based classification has provided evidence of some divergence of genetic risk associations between classical drusen and SDD.

This study investigated the feasibility of using deep learning (DL) models to automatically segment NP and NV on ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography (UWFA) images from patients with DR.Retrospective cross-sectional chart review study. In total, 951 UWFA images were collected from patients with severe non-proliferative DR (NPDR) or proliferative DR (PDR). Each image was segmented and labelled for NP, NV, disc, background and outside areas. Using the labelled images, DL models were trained and validated (80%) using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automated segmentation and tested (20%) on test sets. Accuracy of each model and each label were assessed.The best accuracy from CNN models for each label was 0.8208, 0.8338, 0.9801, 0.9253 and 0.9766 for NP, NV, disc, background and outside areas, respectively. The best Intersection over Union for each label was 0.6806, 0.5675, 0.7107, 0.8551 and 0.924 and mean mean boundary F1 score (BF score) was 0.6702, 0.8742, 0.9092, 0.8103 and 0.9006, respectively.DL models can detect NV and NP as well as disc and outer margins on UWFA with good performance.

Region of interest analysis of individual CVs was performed to identify correlations between CV size, depth and retinal location. Mixed effects multivariate regression analyses of factors associated with NPA and visual acuity (VA) were performed.Fifty-five CVs were identified in 28 BRVO eyes from 27 patients. CVs were identified in 42.9% (12/28) of eyes with a history of BRVO, and of these, 45.5% (25/55) were extramacular. The majority of CVs (87.3%, 48/55) coursed through both the superficial and the deep capillary plexus (DCP), while a subset (12.7%, 7/55) were strictly superficial. No CVs were found to course strictly through the DCP alone. CV depth increased with distance from the optic disc (p=0.011) and CV size increased with distance from the fovea (p=0.005). There were no statistically significant associations between CVs and NPA, or between CVs and VA.WF SS OCTA revealed that a large fraction of CVs that form after BRVO are extramacular, and the morphology of CVs varies as a function of retinal location. Depth-resolved study of CVs may offer valuable insights on the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to the development of macular oedema.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinal disease,2
2023-11-24,37138094,Tear film lipid layer and corneal oxygenation: a new function?,"The classic model of tear film is composed of mucin layer, aqueous layer and the outermost tear film lipid layer (TFLL). The complex mixture of different classes of lipids, mainly secreted by meibomian glands, gives the TFLL unique physicochemical properties. Based on these properties, several functions of TFLL have been found and/or proposed such as the resistance to evaporation and facilitating the formation of a thin film. However, the role of TFLL in the oxygenation of the cornea, a transparent avascular tissue, has never been discussed in the literature. The continuous metabolic activity of the corneal surface and the replenishment of atmospheric gas creates an O2 gradient in the tear film. The molecules of O2 must therefore be transferred from the gas phase to the liquid phase through the TFLL. This process is a function of the diffusion and solubility of the lipid layer as well as interface transfer, which is influenced by alterations in the physical state and lipid composition. In the absence of research on TFLL, the present paper aims to bring the topic into the spotlight for the first time based on existing knowledge on O2 permeability of the lipid membranes and evaporation resistance of the lipid layers. The oxidative stress generated in perturbed lipid layers and the consequent adverse effects are also covered. The function of the TFLL proposed here intends to encourage future research in both basic and clinical sciences, e.g., opening new avenues for the diagnosis and treatment of ocular surface conditions.",no,yes,no,not a study,,,dry eye,2

Eyes were consecutively scanned using Spectralis SD-OCT (20° × 20°, 1024 × 97 × 496). Fundus photographs obtained by the MP-3 allowed to map the stimuli locations onto the corresponding OCT scans. The volume and mean thickness of drusen and HRF within a circle of 240 µm centred at each stimulus point was determined using automated AI-based image segmentation algorithms.8055 individual stimuli from 179 visits from 51 eyes of 35 consecutive patients were matched with the respective OCT images in a point-to-point manner. The patients mean age was 76.85 ± 6.6 years. Mean retinal sensitivity at baseline was 25.7 dB. 73.47% of all MP-spots covered drusen area and 2.02% of MP-spots covered HRF. A negative association between retinal sensitivity and the volume of underlying drusen (p < 0.001, Estimate -0.991 db/µm3) and HRF volume (p = 0.002, Estimate -5.230 db/µm3) was found. During observation time, no eye showed conversion to advanced AMD.A direct correlation between drusen and lower sensitivity of the overlying photoreceptors can be observed. For HRF, a small but significant correlation was shown, which is compromised by their small size.

Machine learning has previously been applied within ophthalmic imaging but has not yet been applied to these risk factors. The study aims to assess the feasibility of predicting the presence or absence of cardiovascular conditions and their associated risk factors using machine learning and OCTA.Cross-sectional study. Demographic and co-morbidity data was collected for each participant undergoing 3 × 3 mm, 6 × 6 mm and 8 × 8 mm OCTA scanning using the Carl Zeiss CIRRUS HD-OCT model 5000. The data was then pre-processed and randomly split into training and testing datasets (75%/25% split) before being applied to two models (Convolutional Neural Network and MoblieNetV2). Once developed on the training dataset, their performance was assessed on the unseen test dataset.Two hundred forty-seven participants were included. Both models performed best in predicting the presence of hyperlipidaemia in 3 × 3 mm scans with an AUC of 0.74 and 0.81, and accuracy of 0.79 for CNN and MobileNetV2 respectively. Modest performance was achieved in the identification of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and congestive heart failure in 3 × 3 mm scans (all with AUC and accuracy >0.5). There was no significant recognition for 6 × 6 and 8 × 8 mm for any cardiometabolic risk factor.This study demonstrates the strength of ML to identify the presence cardiometabolic factors, in particular hyperlipidaemia, in high-resolution 3 × 3 mm OCTA scans.

However, the effect of pulmonary hypertension (PH) on the clinical outcome of patients with HM remains unknown. This study aims to evaluate the prognostic potential of PH in patients with HM and explore the related clinical determinants.This retrospective study included 220 patients with HM and PH and 220 controls without PH, the case-matching cohort analysis was performed based on age, sex, the year of diagnosis and disease type. The baseline characteristics and overall survival (OS) of the patients with HM with or without PH were compared. The cumulative overall survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were conducted to identify the predictors of OS.PH was found in 11.98% (302/2520) of the patients with HM. The PH group had lower levels of hemoglobin, platelet, albumin, fibrinogen and B cell count; whereas the levels of lactate dehydrogenase, N terminal pro B type natriuretic peptide, D-dimer, fibrinogen degradation products and C-reactive protein were higher. Additionally, the PH group had a higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation. Survival analysis revealed that the PH group had an inferior OS compared to the non-PH group (16.9 vs. 37.6 months, p = 0.002). Further subgroup analysis revealed that the severe PH group had the worst OS, followed by the moderate and the mild PH groups (8.7 vs. 14.7 vs. 23.7 months, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that PH was an independent predictor for unfavorable clinical outcomes.Coexisting PH was associated with inferior clinical outcomes in patients with HM, and the severe PH group had the worst prognosis.

2023-11-24,37814421,Immunohistochemical expression of TFF1 is a marker of poor prognosis in retinoblastoma.,"The risk of relapse in retinoblastoma is currently determined by the presence of high-risk histopathologic factors in the enucleated eye. However, the probability of developing metastatic disease is heterogeneous among these patients. Evaluating a biological marker to identify high-risk patients could be useful in clinical setting. This study aims to evaluate whether the expression of TFF1, a surrogate for subtype 2 retinoblastoma, is a prognostic marker for relapse and death.This multicenter cohort study included 273 patients, 48 of whom had extraocular disease. Immunohistochemical staining were performed for CRX, ARR3, TFF1, and Ki67. Tumors were classified as histological subtype 1 (HS1) if they had low or no expression of TFF1 (quick score (QS) ≤ 50) and as histological subtype 2 (HS2) if they expressed TFF1 diffusely (QS > 50). We studied the association between HS classification and outcome.Of 273 patients, 35.9% were classified as HS1, 59.3% as HS2 and 4.8% were not evaluable. In multivariate analysis, patients with HS2 tumors had a higher probability of relapse and death than those with HS1 (p < .0001 and p = .00020, respectively). We identified a higher-risk subgroup among HS2 tumors, presenting non-mutually exclusive expression of ARR3 and TFF1 and had an increased risk of relapse and death compared with tumors that displayed mutually exclusive expression (p = .012 and p = .027, respectively).Expression of TFF1, especially when it is not-mutually exclusive with ARR3, is an independent significant marker of poor outcome in retinoblastoma.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinoblastoma,2
2023-11-24,37848361,Lysosomes in retinal health and disease.,"Lysosomes play crucial roles in various cellular processes - including endocytosis, phagocytosis, and autophagy - which are vital for maintaining retinal health. Moreover, these organelles serve as environmental sensors and act as central hubs for multiple signaling pathways. Through communication with other cellular components, such as mitochondria, lysosomes orchestrate the cytoprotective response essential for preserving cellular homeostasis. This coordination is particularly critical in the retina, given its high metabolic rate and susceptibility to photo-oxidative stress. Consequently, impaired lysosomal function and dysregulated communication between lysosomes and other organelles contribute significantly to the pathobiology of major retinal degenerative diseases.

The vessel density (VD) of the superficial capillary plexus (SCP), intermediate capillary plexus (ICP), deep capillary plexus (DCP), choriocapillaris (CC), and area of foveal avascular zone (FAZ) was measured using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of disease duration and activity on OCTA parameters.The VD of total (p = .007) and the superior (p = .014) and inferior (p = .004) quadrants in SCP was significantly lower in children with JSLE. The VD of total and all quadrants in ICP decreased (p = .015, p = .0045, p = .015, p = .033), except that of the temporal quadrant (p = .366). The total (p = .011) and superior quadrant (p<.01) DCP-VD showed a significant decrease in children with JSLE. The decrease in VD in the total (p = .003) and nasal quadrant (p = .017) of CC was also remarkable. No significant difference in the FAZ area was found between the two groups (p = .774). Multiple linear regression analyses adjusted for age, spherical equivalent, and intraocular pressure were conducted.

Within developed countries, the ability of sheep to survive on low-quality forage intake could act as buffer against climate change. Besides sheep's importance in sustainable agricultural production, there has been less ongoing work in terms of sheep genetics in Near East, Middle East and in Africa. For lamb meat production, body weight and average daily gain (ADG) until weaning are critical economic traits that affects the profitability of the industry. The current study aims to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are significantly associated with pre-weaning growth traits in fat tail Akkaraman lambs using a genome-wide association study (GWAS). A total of 196 Akkaraman lambs were selected for analysis. After quality control, a total of 31,936 SNPs and 146 lambs were used for subsequent analyses. PLINK 1.9 beta software was used for the analyses. Based on Bonferroni-adjusted p-values, one SNP (rs427117280) on chromosome 2 (OAR2) had significant associations with weaning weight at day 90 and ADG from day 0 to day 90, which jointly explains a 0.8% and 0.9% of total genetic variation respectively. The Ovis aries natriuretic peptide C (NPPC) could be considered as a candidate gene for the defined significant associations. The results of the current study will help to increase understanding of the variation in weaning weight and ADG until weaning of Akkaraman lambs and help enhance selection for lambs with improved weaning weight and ADG.

There is a scarcity of data on the accuracy of HF web-based risk scores in this selected population. This study aimed to assess mortality prediction performance of the Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic HF (MAGGIC-HF) risk score and the model of the Barcelona Bio-HF Risk Calculator (BCN-Bio-HF) containing N terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide in HF patients receiving intermittent inotropic support with levosimendan as destination therapy.Four hundred and three advanced HF patients from 23 tertiary hospitals in Spain receiving intermittent inotropic support with levosimendan as destination therapy were included. Discrimination for all-cause mortality was compared by area under the curve (AUC) and Harrell's C-statistic at 1 year. Calibration was assessed by calibration plots comparing observed versus expected events based on estimated risk by each calculator. The included patients were predominantly men, aged 71.5 [interquartile range 64-78] years, with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (27.5 ± 9.4%); ischaemic heart disease was the most prevalent aetiology (52.5%). Death rate at 1 year was 26.8%, while the predicted 1-year mortality by BCN-Bio-HF and MAGGIC-HF was 17.0% and 22.1%, respectively. BCN-Bio-HF AUC was 0.66 (Harrell's C-statistic 0.64), and MAGGIC-HF AUC was 0.62 (Harrell's C-statistic 0.61).The two evaluated risk scores showed suboptimal discrimination and calibration with an underestimation of risk in advanced HF patients receiving levosimendan as destination therapy.

2023-11-24,37993528,Unveiling the potential role of natriuretic peptide receptor a isoforms in fine-tuning the cGMP production and tissue-specific function.,"Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a peptide hormone that regulates blood pressure and volume. ANP interacts with natriuretic peptide receptor-A (NPR-A) to lower the blood pressure through vasodilation, diuresis and natriuresis. Previously, we designed two human ANP analogues, one with exclusively diuretic function (DGD-ANP) and the other with exclusively vasodilatory function (DRD-ANP). Although both ANP analogues interact with NPR-A, their ability to produce cGMP was different. Three alternatively spliced isoforms of NPR-A were previously identified in rodents. Here, we evaluated the putative human isoforms for their cGMP production independently and in combination with WT NPR-A in various percentages. All three NPR-A isoforms failed to produce cGMP in the presence of ANP, DGD-ANP, or DRD-ANP. Co-expression of isoforms with WT NPR-A were found to significantly impair cGMP production. Considering the differential tissue expression levels of all three spliced isoforms in rodents have previously been demonstrated, the existence of these non-functional receptor isoforms may act as negative regulator for ANP/NPR-A activation and fine-tune cGMP production by WT NPR-A to different degree in different tissues. Thus, NPR-A isoforms potentially contribute to tissue-specific functions of ANP.",yes,no,no,in vitro,biomarker,natriuretic,,2

We identified a widespread reduction in the expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) including LHFPL3-AS2 in the treatment-naïve CD ileum of the RISK pediatric cohort. We validated the reduction of LHFPL3-AS2 in adult CD and noted a further reduction in patients with more severe CD from the RISK cohort. LHFPL3-AS2 knockdown in Caco-2 cells robustly affected epithelial monolayer morphogenesis with markedly reduced confluency and spreading, showing atypical rounding, and clumping. mRNA-seq analysis of LHFPL3-AS2 knockdown cells highlighted the reduction of genes and pathways linked with apical polarity, actin bundles, morphogenesis, and the b-catenin-TCF4 complex. LHFPL3-AS2 knockdown significantly reduced the ability of cells to form an internal lumen within the 3-dimensional (3D) cyst model, with mislocalization of actin and adherent and tight junction proteins, affecting epithelial polarity. LHFPL3-AS2 knockdown also resulted in defective mitotic spindle formation and consequent reduction in epithelial proliferation. Altogether, we show that LHFPL3-AS2 reduction affects epithelial morphogenesis, polarity, mitotic spindle formation, and proliferation, which are key processes in maintaining epithelial homeostasis in CD. Reduced expression of LHFPL3-AS2 in CD patients and its further reduction with ileal ulceration outcome, emphasizes its significance in this context.",no,yes,no,in vitro,biomarker,,crohn's disease,2

2023-11-27,35604721,Applications of the Guarded-Needle External Drainage Technique in Vitreoretinal Surgery.,"To describe the surgical technique using the guarded-needle external drainage for a wide variety of applications in vitreoretinal surgery.A step-by-step procedure and a surgical video using the guarded-needle external drainage technique are presented. In addition, a series of representative cases with wide-ranging diagnoses who underwent the technique is reviewed.The guarded-needle using a 27-gauge thin-walled TSK needle (TSK Laboratory International) and a trimmed 70 buckle sleeve are connected to the active extrusion tubing of the vitrectomy machine. External drainage is performed by actively aspirating subretinal fluid using low active vacuum. The guarded-needle external drainage technique is used in cases with bullous detachments, and small and anterior breaks, when performing scleral buckle, for prevention of underfill when using oil tamponade in cases with choroidal effusion, addressing subretinal gas/air, lysing a subretinal band, draining a suprachoroidal hemorrhage, for diabetic tractional retinal detachments, detachments with no definitive break, and subretinal biopsy in exudative detachments.The guarded-needle external drainage has a wide range of applications in vitreoretinal surgery.",no,yes,no,other,,,retinal disease,2
2023-11-27,36171054,Automatic interpretation and clinical evaluation for fundus fluorescein angiography images of diabetic retinopathy patients by deep learning.,"Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) is an important technique to evaluate diabetic retinopathy (DR) and other retinal diseases. The interpretation of FFA images is complex and time-consuming, and the ability of diagnosis is uneven among different ophthalmologists. The aim of the study is to develop a clinically usable multilevel classification deep learning model for FFA images, including prediagnosis assessment and lesion classification.A total of 15 599 FFA images of 1558 eyes from 845 patients diagnosed with DR were collected and annotated. Three convolutional neural network (CNN) models were trained to generate the label of image quality, location, laterality of eye, phase and five lesions. Performance of the models was evaluated by accuracy, F-1 score, the area under the curve and human-machine comparison. The images with false positive and false negative results were analysed in detail.Compared with LeNet-5 and VGG16, ResNet18 got the best result, achieving an accuracy of 80.79%-93.34% for prediagnosis assessment and an accuracy of 63.67%-88.88% for lesion detection. The human-machine comparison showed that the CNN had similar accuracy with junior ophthalmologists. The false positive and false negative analysis indicated a direction of improvement.This is the first study to do automated standardised labelling on FFA images. Our model is able to be applied in clinical practice, and will make great contributions to the development of intelligent diagnosis of FFA images.",no,yes,no,other,diagnostic,,retinopathy,2

2023-11-27,36789997,Cardiac amyloidosis: a significant blind spot of the H2FPEF score.,"Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) often mimics heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Due to very different treatment strategies, an exact diagnosis and differentiation between pure HFpEF and CA-related heart failure (HF) is important. In the present study, we assessed the recently published H<inf>2</inf>FPEF score in patients with pure HFpEF, transthyretin (ATTR), as well as light chain (AL) amyloidosis-related HFpEF and tested whether it differentiates between these entities.The H<inf>2</inf>FPEF scores consists of easy-to-assess clinical (Body Mass Index, number of hypertensive drugs, presence of atrial fibrillation, age) and echocardiographic (systolic pulmonary arterial pressure, E/E´) parameters. It can be computed in a categorical way resulting in scores between 0 and 9 points (0-1: HFpEF rule out, 2-5: further testing required, 6-9: HFpEF rule in), or in a continual way providing an exact percentage of a patient's HFpEF probability. Continuous and categorical variables were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney-U, and χ2-tests. Diagnostic accuracy was computed from 2x2 tables. Survival analysis was performed with Kaplan-Meier curves. A P value of <0.05 was set as the level of significance.A total of 100 patients with pure HFpEF, 53 patients with ATTR, and 34 patients with AL CA were included in the present study. Median age (HFpEF: 71.5 years; ATTR CA: 77.0 years; AL CA: 60.0 years; P<0.001), gender distribution (HFpEF [female]: 73.0%, ATTR (female): 18.9%, AL [female]: 38.2%; P<0.001), and N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (HFpEF: 1045pg/mL; ATTR CA: 1927pg/mL; AL CA: 4308pg/mL; P<0.001) differed significantly between study cohorts. Median H<inf>2</inf>FPEF scores were highest among HFpEF (categorical: 5.0 points; continual: 95.1%), followed by ATTR (categorical: 4.0 points; continual: 89.0%), and AL CA (categorical: 3.0 points; continual: 31.2%). Respective P values were <0.001. Low H<inf>2</inf>FPEF scores (0-1 points) were found among patients in the AL CA cohort (29.4%), but not among HFpEF or ATTR CA patients (P<0.001). The majority of patients, irrespective of disease entity were in the intermediate score range (2-5 points, HFpEF: 80.0% ATTR CA: 94.3%, AL CA: 67.9%; P=0.006). High scores (6-9 points) were most often found among HFpEF patients (20.0%), followed by ATTR CA (5.7%) and AL CA (2.9%), (P=0.007).The H<inf>2</inf>FPEF score should be used with caution, as there is a significant overlap between HFpEF and CA-related HF.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"diagnostic, biomarker",,retinal disease,2
2023-11-27,36803287,"Structural organization of RDGB (retinal degeneration B), a multi-domain lipid transfer protein: a molecular modelling and simulation based approach.","Lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) that shuttle lipids at membrane contact sites (MCS) play an important role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. One such important LTP is the Retinal Degeneration B (RDGB) protein. RDGB is localized at the MCS formed between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the apical plasma membrane (PM) in Drosophila photoreceptors where it transfers phosphatidylinositol (PI) during G-protein coupled phospholipase C signalling. Previously, the C-terminal domains of RDGB have been shown to be essential for its function and accurate localization. In this study, using in-silico integrative modelling we predict the structure of entire RDGB protein in complex with the ER membrane protein VAP. The structure of RDGB has then been used to decipher the structural features of the protein important for its orientation at the contact site. Using this structure, we identify two lysine residues in the C-terminal helix of the LNS2 domain important for interaction with the PM. Using molecular docking, we also identify an unstructured region USR1, immediately c-terminal to the PITP domain that is important for the interaction of RDGB with VAP. Overall the 10.06 nm length of the predicted RDGB-VAP complex spans the distance between the PM and ER and is consistent with the cytoplasmic gap between the ER and PM measured by transmission electron microscopy in photoreceptors. Overall our model explains the topology of the RDGB-VAP complex at this ER-PM contact site and paves the way for analysis of lipid transfer function in this setting.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

All patients underwent three fundus examinations, and all images were graded using the ETDRS severity scale. We compared and analysed the agreement of DR severity and the relative visible retinal area among the three fundus examination methods, and the number and type of lesions outside the ETDRS seven-field (peripheral lesions) between the two UWF imaging methods.A total of 202 patients (386 eyes) were included. Weighted kappa for the agreement between ETDRS seven-field and blinded Optos images was 0.485; between ETDRS seven-field and blinded Clarus images, 0.924; and between blinded Optos and Clarus images, 0.461. Blinded Clarus showed excellent performance when a ETDRS scale was used for grading the images. The relative visible retinal area for ETDRS seven-field images was 195 ± 28 disc area (DA); single Optos images, 371 ± 69 DA; single Clarus images, 261 ± 65 DA; two-montage Clarus images, 462 ± 112 DA; and four-montage Clarus images, 598 ± 139 DA. The relative visible retinal area was statistically significant between any two of the imaging systems used. In total, 2015 and 4200 peripheral lesions were detected in single Optos and Clarus images, respectively (P < 0.001). These peripheral lesions on two UWF images suggested a more severe DR level in approximately 10% and 12% of eyes, respectively.UWF-Clarus fundus imaging offers a suitable assessment approach for DR severity; it could improve DR diagnosis and has the potential to replace ETDRS seven-field imaging after additional clinical trials.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,diagnostic,,retinopathy,2
2023-11-27,37202601,CXCL8 as a Potential Biomarker for Crohn's Disease is Associated with Immune Infiltration and RNA Methylation.,"TRP channels have an important role in regulating the function of gastrointestinal epithelial cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms of genes associated with TRP channels in Crohn's disease (CD) by bioinformatics approach and to identify potential key biomarkers. In our study, we identified TRP channel-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) based on the GSE95095 dataset and the TRP channel-related gene set from the GeneCards database. Hub genes (CXCL8, HIF1A, NGF, JUN, IL1A) were identified by the PPI network and validated by the external GSE52746 dataset. Immune infiltration analysis revealed that CXCL8 was significantly correlated with B cells memory, NK cells activated, Mast cells resting, Mast cells activated, and Neutrophils. GSEA of CXCL8 results showed inositol phosphate metabolism, RNA polymerase, propanoate metabolism, MAPK signaling pathway, base excision repair, and Calcium signaling pathway. In addition, we constructed a lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA network and a drug-gene interaction network. Finally, we performed in vitro experiments to verify that LPS induced CXCL8 expression in HT-29 cells and that knockdown of CXCL8 inhibited the inflammatory stimulatory effects of LPS. This study reveals that CXCL8 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease and is expected to be a novel biomarker.",no,yes,no,in vitro,biomarker,,crohn's disease,2

Subjects were inborn boys with birth weight <2000 g. ""Cases"" were consecutive subjects with ROP of any severity. ""Controls"" were consecutive unrelated subjects without ROP. Recipients of blood or exchange transfusions were excluded. Sixty cases (out of 98 screened) and 60 controls (out of 93 screened) were enrolled. G6PD activity (quantitative assay) as the candidate risk factor was evaluated.Sixty cases with 60 controls [mean (SD) gestation 28.80 (2.2) and 30.60 (2.2) wk respectively] were compared. ""Cases"" had a higher median (1st, 3rd quartile) G6PD activity compared to ""controls"" [7.39 (4.7, 11.5) vs. 6.28 (4.2, 8.8) U/g Hb, p = 0.084]. G6PD activity was highest among ROP requiring treatment [8.68 (4.7, 12.3)] followed by ROP not requiring treatment [6.91 (4.4, 11.0)], followed by controls (plinear trend = 0.06). Gestation, birth weight, duration of oxygen, breastmilk feeding, and clinical sepsis were other variables associated with ROP on univariable analysis. On multivariable logistic regression, G6PD activity [Adjusted OR 1.14 (1.03, 1.25), p = 0.01] and gestation [Adjusted OR 0.74 (0.56, 0.97), p = 0.03] independently predicted ROP. C-statistic of the model was 0.76 (95% CI 0.67, 0.85).Higher G6PD activity was independently associated with ROP after adjusting for confounders. Each 1 U/g Hb increase in G6PD increased the odds of ROP by 14%. Severer forms of ROP were associated with higher levels of G6PD activity.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinopathy,2
2023-11-27,37243505,Bacterial Oncotraits Rather than Spatial Organization Are Associated with Dysplasia in Ulcerative Colitis.,"Colonic bacterial biofilms are frequently present in ulcerative colitis [UC] and may increase dysplasia risk through pathogens expressing oncotraits. This prospective cohort study aimed to determine [1] the association of oncotraits and longitudinal biofilm presence with dysplasia risk in UC, and [2] the relation of bacterial composition with biofilms and dysplasia risk.Faeces and left- and right-sided colonic biopsies were collected from 80 UC patients and 35 controls. Oncotraits [FadA of Fusobacterium, BFT of Bacteroides fragilis, colibactin [ClbB] and Intimin [Eae] of Escherichia coli] were assessed in faecal DNA with multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction [qPCR]. Biopsies were screened for biofilms [n = 873] with 16S rRNA fluorescent in situ hybridiation. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing [n = 265], and ki67-immunohistochemistry were performed. Associations were determined with a mixed-effects regression model.Biofilms were highly prevalent in UC patients [90.8%] with a median persistence of 3 years (interquartile range [IQR] 2-5 years). Biofilm-positive biopsies showed increased epithelial hypertrophy [p = 0.025] and a reduced Shannon diversity independent of disease status [p = 0.015], but were not significantly associated with dysplasia in UC: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63-3.40. In contrast, ClbB independently associated with dysplasia [aOR 7.16, 95% CI 1.75-29.28], and FadA and Fusobacteriales were associated with a decreased dysplasia risk in UC [aOR 0.23, 95% CI 0.06-0.83, p <0.01].Biofilms are a hallmark of UC; however, because of their high prevalence are a poor biomarker for dysplasia. In contrast, colibactin presence and FadA absence independently associate with dysplasia in UC and might therefore be valuable biomarkers for future risk stratification and intervention strategies.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,ulcerative colitis,2

Aberrant DNA methylation has been identified in peripheral blood and bulk intestinal tissue from CD patients. However, the DNA methylome of disease-associated intestinal CD4+ lymphocytes has not been evaluated.Genome-wide DNA methylation sequencing was performed from terminal ileum CD4+ cells from 21 CD patients and 12 age- and sex-matched controls. Data were analysed for differentially methylated CpGs [DMCs] and methylated regions [DMRs]. Integration was performed with RNA-sequencing data to evaluate the functional impact of DNA methylation changes on gene expression. DMRs were overlapped with regions of differentially open chromatin [by ATAC-seq] and CCCTC-binding factor [CTCF] binding sites [by ChIP-seq] between peripherally derived Th17 and Treg cells.CD4+ cells in CD patients had significantly increased DNA methylation compared to those from the controls. A total of 119 051 DMCs and 8113 DMRs were detected. While hypermethylated genes were mostly related to cell metabolism and homeostasis, hypomethylated genes were significantly enriched within the Th17 signalling pathway. The differentially enriched ATAC regions in Th17 cells [compared to Tregs] were hypomethylated in CD patients, suggesting heightened Th17 activity. There was significant overlap between hypomethylated DNA regions and CTCF-associated binding sites.The methylome of CD patients shows an overall dominant hypermethylation yet hypomethylation is more concentrated in proinflammatory pathways, including Th17 differentiation. Hypomethylation of Th17-related genes associated with areas of open chromatin and CTCF binding sites constitutes a hallmark of CD-associated intestinal CD4+ cells.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,crohn's disease,2
2023-11-27,37329217,Understanding the Genetics of Early-Onset Obesity in a Cohort of Children From Qatar.,"Monogenic obesity is a rare form of obesity due to pathogenic variants in genes implicated in the leptin-melanocortin signaling pathway and accounts for around 5% of severe early-onset obesity. Mutations in the genes encoding the MC4R, leptin, and leptin receptor are commonly reported in various populations to cause monogenic obesity. Determining the genetic cause has important clinical benefits as novel therapeutic interventions are now available for some forms of monogenic obesity.To unravel the genetic causes of early-onset obesity in the population of Qatar.In total, 243 patients with early-onset obesity (above the 95% percentile) and age of onset below 10 years were screened for monogenic obesity variants using a targeted gene panel, consisting of 52 obesity-related genes.Thirty rare variants potentially associated with obesity were identified in 36 of 243 (14.8%) probands in 15 candidate genes (LEP, LEPR, POMC, MC3R, MC4R, MRAP2, SH2B1, BDNF, NTRK2, DYRK1B, SIM1, GNAS, ADCY3, RAI1, and BBS2). Twenty-three of the variants identified were novel to this study and the rest, 7 variants, were previously reported in literature. Variants in MC4R were the most common cause of obesity in our cohort (19%) and the c.485C>T p.T162I variant was the most frequent MC4R variant seen in 5 patients.We identified likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants that seem to explain the phenotype of around 14.8% of our cases. Variants in the MC4R gene are the commonest cause of early-onset obesity in our population. Our study represents the largest monogenic obesity cohort in the Middle East and revealed novel obesity variants in this understudied population.

These eyes were classified into 2 groups: the VL group (best-corrected visual acuity 6 months after PDT was worse than that at baseline) and the vision maintenance or improved group (the others). Baseline factors were analyzed to determine the characteristics of the VL group and assess the diagnostic potential of these factors.Seventeen eyes were included in the VL group. The mean values of the neurosensory retinal (NSR) thickness, the internal limiting membrane-external limiting membrane thickness (IET), and the external limiting membrane-photoreceptor outer segment thickness (EOT) in the VL group were significantly thinner than those in the vision maintenance or improved group (NSR thickness, 123.2 ± 39.7 µm vs 166.3 ± 49.6 µm, P < .001; IET, 63.1 ± 17.0 µm vs 88.0 ± 25.4 µm, P < .001; EOT, 60.1 ± 28.6 µm vs 78.3 ± 33.1, P = .041).

The CON and GON eyes were matched by the average peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness (1:1). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCTA were performed to compare the structural and vascular change of the peripapillary and macular region between groups.Both CON and GON eyes showed more severe structural and vascular damage than the control eyes. The CON eyes had lower pRNFL thickness than the GON eyes in the temporal and nasal quadrants, and thicker pRNFL thickness in the inferior quadrant. The average GCC thickness did not differ between the two groups. The peripapillary vessel density of the CON group was significantly higher in the inferior sectors than that of the GON group. In the macular region, the CON group had significantly higher vessel density in the whole image, the temporal sector in parafovea region, and the temporal, superior, and inferior sectors in perifovea region.To a similar degree of structural damage, CON had less retinal vascular impairment than GON, especially in the macular region, and the significance of the finding needs further evaluation.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,diagnostic,,"retinopathy, retinal disease",2

The SLE patients were divided into two subgroups: patients with SLE with no ocular disease (group I) and patients with SLE with signs of retinopathy (group II). The superficial vessel density (SVD), deep vessel density (DVD), peripapillary retinal vessel densities (pRVD), choroidal thickness (ChT), and choroidal vascularity including total choroidal area (TCA), luminal area (LA), stromal area (SA), and choroidal vascularity index (CVI) were measured using SS-OCT/OCTA. Physical and ophthalmic examinations as well as the assessments of immunological markers were performed. The results of SS-OCT/OCTA were compared between group I, group II, and group HC, while the correlations among the parameters were analyzed.The SVD, DVD, and pRVD were found to be significantly lower in SLE patients than group HC, especially in SLE patients with signs of retinopathy. ChT were found to be significantly higher in group II. CVI was positively correlated with SVD and DVD in the fovea, as well as the foveal and parafoveal thickness. A significant decrease in SVD and DVD in the fovea among subjects positive for anti-dsDNA antibodies was noted.The application of OCTA in the evaluation of microvasculature may be useful in subclinical changes. Retinal microvascular density decreased in patients with SLE with greater severity of SLE. Disturbed retinal circulation was related to SLE disease activity, disease duration, CVI, and being positive for anti-dsDNA antibodies. The study results also suggest that SLE with signs of retinopathy may affect the choroid with increases in LA, SA, TCA, and ChT.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinopathy,2

We calculated topographic incidence of DDAF and DDAF + QDAF, as well as velocity of progression of the border of lesions using Euclidean distance mapping.Incidence of atrophy was highest near the fovea, then decreased in incidence with increased foveal eccentricity. However, the rate of atrophy progression followed the opposite pattern; rate of atrophy increased with distance from foveal center. The mean growth rate 500 microns from the foveal center for DDAF + QDAF was 39 microns per year (95% CI = 28-49), whereas the mean growth rate 3000 microns from the foveal center was 342 microns per year (95% CI = 194-522). No difference in growth rate was noted by axis around the fovea.Incidence and progression of atrophy by fundus autofluorescence follow opposite patterns in STGD1.

However, its association with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) remains obscure.Here, we examined the prognostic value of baseline RBP4 and its derived multimarker score for MACEs in ACS patients.A total of 826 patients with ACS were consecutively recruited from the department of cardiology and prospectively followed up for a median of 1.95 years (interquartile range, 1.02-3.25 years). Plasma RBP4 was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Adjusted associations between RBP4 and its derived multimarker score (1 point was assigned when RBP4 ≥ 38.18μg/mL, left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] ≤ 55%, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP] ≥ 450 ng/L, estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≤ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2, and age ≥60) with MACEs were analyzed.In total, 269 ACS patients (32.57%) experienced MACEs. When patients were grouped by multimarker score (0-1, n = 315; 2-3, n = 406; 4-5, n = 105), there was a significant graded association between RBP4-based multimarker score and risk of MACEs (intermediate score (2-3): HRadj: 1.80; 95% CI, 1.34-2.41; high score (4-5): HRadj: 3.26; 95% CI, 2.21-4.81) and its components (P < .05 for each).

Moreover, we selected 6 variants associated with immune, cells adhesion, platelet function, homeostasis, and ion channel signaling and expanded the sample size (1247 KD patients containing 713 males and 534 females, 803 healthy population containing 481 males and 322 females) for genotyping validation. From the results, USH2A/rs148135241, LMO7/rs142687160, CEMIP/rs12441101, and EFCC1/rs142391828 presented significant differences of alleles/genotypes frequency distributions between male and female only in KD patients (which were consistent with the result of WES analysis) but not in healthy population. In addition, the result also found that only EFCC1/rs142391828 polymorphism was associated with KD susceptibility. This result suggested that those four variants might play critical roles in sex bias in KD. The study would be in favor of a sex-specific genome atlas establishing and novel sex-specific precision therapies development for KD.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,kawasaki disease,2
2023-11-27,37474658,Assessment of lacrimal gland involvement in primary Sjögren's syndrome using gray-scale ultrasonography and shear wave elastography.,"The aim of this study was to assess lacrimal gland involvement in primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) using lacrimal gland gray-scale ultrasound (LGUS) and two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE).Eighty-five pSS patients with a mean age of 51.16 ± 10.61 years and 84 sex- and age-matched healthy subjects with a mean age of 50.94 ± 11.05 years were included in the study. Lacrimal gland parenchymal findings and 2D-SWE values were compared between the two groups and the correlations of LGUS parameters with clinical findings, dry eye tests, and minor salivary gland biopsy (MSGB) were further investigated.LGUS parenchymal grade was 0 in 14 (16.5%), 1 in 45 (52.9%), 2 in 23 (27.1%), and 3 in 3 patients (3.5%) in the pSS group, while in the control group, parenchymal grades were 0 (57.1%) and 1 (42.9%). The mean 2D-SWE value of pSS patients was significantly higher than the control group (p < 0.05) and increased parallel with lacrimal parenchymal grade. The elasticity modulus had a high diagnostic performance in detecting lacrimal gland involvement in pSS patients (AUC 0.901, sensitivity 70.6%, specificity 97.6%), while the diagnostic performance of LGUS was much lower (AUC 0.769, sensitivity 83.5%, specificity 57.1%). LGUS and 2D-SWE values were found to be correlated with dry eye tests and MSGB results (p < 0.05).LGUS and 2D-SWE are both useful for assessing the lacrimal gland involvement in pSS patients; however, 2D-SWE has a better diagnostic performance than LGUS and found to be correlated with dry eye tests.Lacrimal gland US and two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE) are imaging modalities that can be used to demonstrate parenchymal involvement of the lacrimal gland in primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS).• Gray-scale US and two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE) have been widely used in the recent decade to assess gland involvement in patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). • The elasticity modulus had a high diagnostic performance in detecting lacrimal gland involvement in primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) patients. • Lacrimal gland US and two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE) are both useful for assessing the lacrimal gland in primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) patients; however, two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE) has a better diagnostic performance than lacrimal gland ultrasound (LGUS).",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,diagnostic,,dry eye,2
2023-11-27,37486527,Low Serum Hepcidin Levels in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis - Implications for Treatment of Co-existent Iron-Deficiency Anemia.,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is often associated with anemia. Hepcidin, the central regulator of iron homeostasis, is known to be induced by inflammation and suppressed by anemia. It is not clear how hepcidin is affected in those with UC, when both inflammation and anemia may co-exist.Such knowledge may hold implications for treatment. Hematological and iron-related parameters, C-reactive protein (CRP), growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) and erythroferrone (ERFE) (erythroid regulators of hepcidin) levels were estimated in blood from those with UC and in control subjects. Values for hematological and iron-related parameters showed evidence of iron-deficiency and resultant anemia, in patients with UC. The presence of UC was significantly associated with inflammation. Serum levels of ERFE, but not of GDF-15, were significantly higher in patients with UC than in control patients, while hepcidin levels were significantly lower. Serum hepcidin concentrations in patients with UC correlated positively with serum iron, ferritin and GDF-15, and negatively with serum ERFE. The iron status and serum hepcidin levels in UC patients with co-existent anemia were significantly lower and serum ERFE values significantly higher than in those with UC without anemia. The effect of anemia on hepcidin predominated over that of inflammation in patients with UC, resulting in suppressed hepcidin levels. This effect is possibly mediated through erythroferrone. We suggest that a serum hepcidin-guided approach may be useful to guide use of oral iron supplements to treat co-existent iron-deficiency anemia in patients with UC and other chronic inflammatory diseases.",no,yes,no,other,biomarker,,ulcerative colitis,2

In each case, graders were asked to determine if there were changes that warranted a full clinical assessment after viewing 2 consecutive scans using one of 3 different imaging strategies: MTMs alone, individual foveal-centered B scans alone, or 5 macular B scans including the foveal-centered B scan. Graders were told the 2 scans were taken 2 weeks apart. The consensus ground truth was reached by the graders using a CIRRUS review station to evaluate all the information contained within the OCT scans.A total of 53 eyes were included in this study with 1385 imaging sessions. The Fleiss kappa was highest when graders were given MTMs alone compared with the ground truth. When the averages of all 5 graders were compared with the ground truth, the MTMs alone showed the highest level of agreement (90.05%, SD 0.78%) followed by the central B scans (87.87%, SD 1.59%) and the 5-B scan method (86.512%, SD 0.64%).MTMs alone provide sufficient information to easily identify recurrent exudation in patients with eAMD, and these maps may be all that is needed for remote monitoring.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,diagnostic,,retinal disease,2
2023-11-27,37530128,Analysis and identification of ferroptosis-related genes in ulcerative colitis.,"Previous studies have shown that ferroptosis is associated with the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC). Therefore, this study aimed to identify key ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) associated with the diagnosis of UC.UC-related expression datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. First, Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify UC-related genes (UCRGs). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between normal and UC groups were screened in GSE87466, and DEGs were subjected to an intersection analysis with FRGs and UCRGs to obtain ferroptosis-related DEGs (FR DEGs). Then a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed for FR DEGs. The hub genes were extracted based on the degree, Maximum Neighborhood Component (MNC), closeness, and Maximal Clique Centrality (MCC). Biomarkers with diagnostic values were screened by support vector machine (SVM) and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithms. Next, the infiltration of immune cells was compared between UC and normal groups, and the correlation between different immune cells and diagnostic genes was analyzed. The biological functions, classical pathways, and intermolecular interaction networks of diagnostic genes were characterized utilizing ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA). Finally, a TF-mRNA network was constructed and potential small-molecule compounds were screened.Thirty-six FR DEGs were obtained, and these were enriched in biological processes such as positive regulation of cytokine production, cytokine-mediated signalling pathway, long-chain fatty acid-CoA ligase activity, etc. Among 18 hub genes, five genes (ALOX5, TIMP1, TNFAIP3, SOCS1, DUOX2) were captured with diagnostic values for UC, and they displayed significant differences between UC and normal groups. Sixteen immune cell infiltrates were significantly different between UC and normal groups, such as activated dendritic cells and resting dendritic cells. TNFAIP3 and ALOX5 were positively correlated with neutrophils, and TIMP1, SOCS1, ALOX5, and DUOX2 were negatively correlated with M2 macrophages. IPA showed that diagnostic genes were related to 43 function modules and activated 17 pathways. The constructed TF-mRNA regulatory network comprised three diagnostic genes and 17 differentially expressed TFs. Potential small-molecule compounds including helveticoside and cymarin were identified.Our findings yielded several promising FRGs for UC, providing a scientific reference for further studies on the pathogenesis of UC.",no,yes,no,other,"diagnostic, biomarker",,ulcerative colitis,2
2023-11-27,37530443,The genetic counselor workforce in inherited retinal disease clinics: a descriptive assessment.,"Genetic counselors (GCs) have practiced in Inherited Retinal Disease (IRD) clinics for several decades. In this small subspecialty of genetic counseling, GCs are critical for patient understanding of genetic information, which can have prognostic, systemic, family planning and therapeutic implications. Recently, both access to genetic testing for IRDs and the number of genes associated with IRDs (>350) has increased dramatically. However, the practice models and roles of IRD GCs have not been previously described.GCs working in academic IRD clinics were surveyed to assess their experience, clinical practices, and roles performed. The collected data was compared to the broader genetic counseling profession and to other specialties using publicly available data on GC professional practices.While roles of IRD GCs were overlapping with those of the overall genetic counseling profession, all survey respondents reported diverse roles that included both clinical and non-clinical duties, spending up to half their time on research and educational responsibilities. Most respondents (89%) felt that their clinic's MD to GC ratio was too high, while clinical load varied. IRD GCs report varying degrees of prior genetic counseling and ophthalmology-specific experience but unanimously desire additional subspecialty-specific training.This descriptive assessment of a small subspecialty suggests a need for growth in the number of GCs practicing in IRD clinics and could help to inform development of new GC positions in IRD centers. It also highlights the desire for additional GC-specific education and may be relevant to curriculum development within GC programs.",no,yes,no,other,,,retinal disease,2
2023-11-27,37548407,Mutation spectrum of retinoblastoma patients in Vietnam.,"Retinoblastoma (RB), an intraocular malignancy commonly diagnosed in children, is mostly caused by inactivating mutations of both alleles of the RB1 gene. Early genetic screening for RB1 gene mutations would greatly improve treatment outcomes and patient management.In this study, both somatic and germline mutations were detected in blood and tumour samples of 42 RB patients using direct sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification.In total, 34 different mutations were found in 36 patients, including 1 SNP, 4 large deletions, 5 splicing sites, 1 missense, 7 frameshifts and 17 nonsense mutations. There were five novel mutations and one unreported which have not been found in large databases such as Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD) and ClinVar.A higher rate of RB patients carrying heterozygous germline mutation and highly prevalent with pathogenic truncated mutation, hence, early detection of RB is essential for vision salvation and genetic counselling.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinoblastoma,2
2023-11-27,37561309,Accuracy of ultrasound vs. Fourier-domain optic biometry for measuring preoperative axial length in cases of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.,"To identify a method for accurately measuring preoperative axial length (AL) in cases of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD).Retrospective study.This retrospective study included 83 eyes of 83 patients who underwent vitrectomy for RRD and had both preoperative and postoperative data for AL. Preoperative AL measurements for the affected eye were obtained using ultrasound (aUS-AL) and compared with those for affected and fellow eyes measured using optical biometry (aOB-AL and fOB-AL, respectively). Absolute differences between preoperative aUS-AL, aOB-AL, or fOB-AL measurements and postoperative AL (aPost-AL) were examined.In the 41 eyes without macular detachment, the absolute difference between aOB-AL and aPost-AL (0.06±0.07 mm) was significantly smaller than between aUS-AL and aPost-AL (0.21±0.18 mm) and that between fOB-AL and aPost-AL (0.29±0.35 mm) (P = 0.017 and P < 0.001, respectively). In the 42 eyes with macular detachment, the absolute difference between aOB-AL and aPost-AL (1.22±2.40 mm) was significantly larger than between aUS-AL and aPost-AL (0.24±0.24 mm) and between fOB-AL and aPost-AL (0.35±0.49 mm) (P = 0.006, P = 0.016, respectively).The current findings suggest that aOB-AL is more accurate than aUS-AL or fOB-AL in cases of RRD without macular detachment, while aUS-AL or fOB-AL is more accurate than aOB-AL in cases with macular detachment.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,diagnostic,,retinal disease,2
2023-11-27,37563596,Competing risks analysis for neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio as a predictor of diabetic retinopathy incidence in the Scottish population.,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major sight-threatening microvascular complication in individuals with diabetes. Systemic inflammation combined with oxidative stress is thought to capture most of the complexities involved in the pathology of diabetic retinopathy. A high level of neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is an indicator of abnormal immune system activity. Current estimates of the association of NLR with diabetes and its complications are almost entirely derived from cross-sectional studies, suggesting that the nature of the reported association may be more diagnostic than prognostic. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the utility of NLR as a biomarker to predict the incidence of DR in the Scottish population.The incidence of DR was defined as the time to the first diagnosis of R1 or above grade in the Scottish retinopathy grading scheme from type 2 diabetes diagnosis. The effect of NLR and its interactions were explored using a competing risks survival model adjusting for other risk factors and accounting for deaths. The Fine and Gray subdistribution hazard model (FGR) was used to predict the effect of NLR on the incidence of DR.We analysed data from 23,531 individuals with complete covariate information. At 10 years, 8416 (35.8%) had developed DR and 2989 (12.7%) were lost to competing events (death) without developing DR and 12,126 individuals did not have DR. The median (interquartile range) level of NLR was 2.04 (1.5 to 2.7). The optimal NLR cut-off value to predict retinopathy incidence was 3.04. After accounting for competing risks at 10 years, the cumulative incidence of DR and deaths without DR were 50.7% and 21.9%, respectively. NLR was associated with incident DR in both Cause-specific hazard (CSH = 1.63; 95% CI: 1.28-2.07) and FGR models the subdistribution hazard (sHR = 2.24; 95% CI: 1.70-2.94). Both age and HbA1c were found to modulate the association between NLR and the risk of DR.The current study suggests that NLR has a promising potential to predict DR incidence in the Scottish population, especially in individuals less than 65 years and in those with well-controlled glycaemic status.",no,yes,no,other,biomarker,,retinopathy,2
2023-11-27,37566303,Relationship between the distribution of intra-retinal hyper-reflective foci and the progression of intermediate age-related macular degeneration.,"To assess the relationship between the distribution of intra-retinal hyper-reflective foci (IHRF) on optical coherence tomography (OCT) and progression of intermediate age-related macular degeneration (iAMD) over 2 years.Cirrus OCT volumes of the macula of subjects enrolled in the Amish Eye Study with 2 years of follow-up were evaluated for the presence of iAMD and IHRF at baseline. The IHRF were counted in a series of 5 sequential en face slabs from outer to inner retina. The number of IHRF in each slab at baseline and the change in IHRF from baseline to year 2 were correlated with progression to late AMD at 2 years.Among 120 eyes from 71 patients with iAMD, 52 eyes (43.3%) of 42 patients had evidence of both iAMD and IHRF at baseline. Twenty-three eyes (19.0%) showed progression to late AMD after 2 years. The total IHRF count increased from 243 at baseline to 604 at 2 years, with a significant increase in the IHRF number in each slab, except for the innermost slab 5 which had no IHRF at baseline or follow-up. The IHRF count increased from 121 to 340 in eyes that showed progression to late AMD. The presence of IHRF in the outermost retinal slabs 1 and 2 was independently associated with a significant risk of progression to late AMD. A greater increase in IHRF count over 2 years in these same slabs 1 and 2 was also associated with a higher risk of conversion to late AMD.The risk of progression to late AMD appears to be significantly associated with the distribution and extent of IHRF in the outermost retinal layers. This observation may point to significant pathophysiologic differences of IHRF in inner versus outer layers of the retina.",no,yes,no,other,biomarker,,retinal disease,2

More than 50% of patients seeking ophthalmologic consultations have symptoms and signs indicating one or both entities. We summarize the key points of diagnosis and management of both diseases, comparing the work of Dry Eye Workshop II (2017) with the dry eye blepharitis syndrome unification theory. The impact of MGD/blepharitis on ocular surgery also is described. Although MGD and blepharitis seem to be uncurable, most of the time they can be successfully controlled.

Allergic conjunctivitis and allergic contact dermatitis are the most common causes of chronic itch of the eyes and eyelids, respectively. Other diagnoses to consider include atopic dermatitis, xerosis, neurogenic itch, dry eye syndrome, seborrheic dermatitis, blepharitis, rosacea, lichen simplex chronicus, and papulosquamous disorders.

Retinal abnormalities were assessed via ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography (UWF-FA) and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). The eyes were grouped into 3: the first group comprised of eyes with normal findings on UWF-FA; the second group comprised of eyes with abnormal findings on UWF-FA but without any retinal ischemia; and the third group involved eyes with retinal ischemia or neovascularization.Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/20 in all eyes. Forty eyes (65.6%) had abnormalities on UWF-FA. The most common feature was peripheral vascular looping, increased tortuosity, and anastomosis (63.9%). ODM/ODD ratio was higher in group 3 compared to groups 1 and 2. Deep foveal VD was lower in group 1 compared to groups 2 and 3.

Prospective study consisted of a cross-sectional phase with 61 IIM patients and 32 individuals without IIM and longitudinal phase, in which patients were divided into two subgroups: 26 with reduced LV GLS and 35 with normal LV GLS; patients were followed for a mean of 25 months, and the occurrence of cardiovascular events and criteria for IIM activity were compared. The mean LV GLS (18.5 ± 2.9% vs. 21.6 ± 2.5%; p < 0.001) and right ventricle free wall strain (21.9 ± 6.1% vs. 27.5 ± 4.7%; p < 0.001) were lower in patients than in controls. The mean N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide level was higher in patients than in controls. There were no differences regarding other cardiac involvement. Anti-Jo1 antibody was associated with general electrocardiographic abnormality and LV diastolic dysfunction. The subgroup with reduced GLS progressed with higher mean creatine phosphokinase, myositis disease activity assessment visual analogue scales, the physician's and patient's visual analogue scales, the health assessment questionnaire, and a higher proportion of relapses than the subgroup with normal GLS. There was no difference between the subgroups regarding cardiovascular events. The LV GLS appears to be useful for evaluating patients with IIM.

2023-11-27,37593943,Prevalence and risk factors of ischemic monocular vision loss and concurrent brain ischemia.,"We performed a retrospective cohort study to identify predictors of concurrent asymptomatic brain ischemia in patients with ischemic monocular vision loss.An inpatient database research of admissions to the Helios University Hospital Wuppertal, Germany between 01/2016 and 12/2020 was conducted. Inclusion criteria were confirmed diagnosis of transient monocular vision loss (MVL), retinal artery occlusion (RAO), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain within 10 days of MVL. Silent brain ischemia (SBI) was defined as diffusion restrictions with corresponding reduced apparent diffusion coefficient in MRI and an absence of neurological deficits besides those complying with MVL in clinical examination. The prevalence and cardiovascular predictors of SBI were analyzed with logistic regression and an artificial neural network.One hundred fourteen out of 475 patients treated with monocular vision loss were included in this study. The mean age was 67.7 ± 13.6 years. 48.2% were male and 47.4% had RAO. MRI scan of the brain was performed after 3.9 ± 2.3 days and detected SBI in 17%. Age ⩾67 years, cardiac etiology of MVL, and cerebral ischemia in medical history were revealed as predictors of SBI in MRI.Patients older than 66 years, with a suspected cardiac embolism as the cause of RAO and previous cerebral ischemia, are more likely to present SBI in cerebral MRI.

Colonoscopy, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance enterography revealed two stenoses of the ileum and multiple enlarged lymph nodes around the oral-side ileal stenosis. We accordingly performed transoral double-balloon enteroscopy and found ileal stenosis with an irregular mucosal surface. Based on pathological examination of the stenosis, adenocarcinoma of the small bowel was diagnosed for the oral-side stenosis. The stenosis on the anal side was benign. The two stenoses were resected simultaneously, and lymph node dissection was performed on the cancerous lesion. The diagnosis of the cancerous lesion was pStage IIIB, and immunohistochemical staining was positive for tumor protein 53. Patients with Crohn's disease are at a high risk of small bowel cancer, but no surveillance protocol has been established to date. We encountered a case of Crohn's disease in which radical surgery was possible, owing to preoperative pathological diagnosis, by using balloon-assisted enteroscopy. In this paper, we report a case that suggests the importance of performing balloon-assisted enteroscopy when small bowel stenosis is detected in patients with Crohn's disease.",no,yes,no,other,diagnostic,,crohn's disease,2
2023-11-27,37608570,Regulation of epithelial cell differentiation by the Ubiquitous expressed transcript isoform 1 in ulcerative colitis.,"Mucosal healing has emerged as a desirable treatment goal for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Healing of mucosal wounds involves epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation, and Y-box transcription factor ZONAB has recently been identified as the key modulator of intestinal epithelial restitution.We studied the characteristics of UXT-V1 expression in UC patients using immunohistochemistry and qPCR. The functional role of UXT-V1 in the colonic epithelium was investigated using lentivirus-mediated shRNA in vitro and ex vivo. Through endogenous Co-immunoprecipitation and LC-MS/MS, we identified ZONAB as a UXT-V1-interactive protein.Herein, we report that UXT-V1 promotes differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells by regulating the nuclear translocation of ZONAB. UXT-V1 was upregulated in the intestinal epithelia of UC patients compared with that of healthy controls. Knocking down UXT-V1 in NCM-460 cells led to the enrichment of pathways associated with proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, the absence of UXT-V1 in cultured intestinal epithelial cells and colonic organoids inhibited differentiation to the goblet cell phenotype. Mechanistically, the loss of UXT-V1 in the intestinal epithelial cells allowed nuclear translocation of ZONAB, wherein it regulated the transcription of differentiation-related genes, including AML1 and KLF4.Taken together, our study reveals a potential role of UXT-V1 in regulating epithelial cell differentiation, proving a molecular basis for mucosal healing in UC.",no,yes,no,in vitro,biomarker,,ulcerative colitis,2

A total of 116 participants with severe PFL due to retinitis pigmentosa (RP) or glaucoma were recruited at the Kellogg Eye Center and completed the Likert-scaled telephone-administered questionnaire. Included participants had a horizontal extent of their visual field <20 degrees (RP) or a mixed or generalized stage 4 to 5 defect using the Enhanced Glaucoma Staging System (glaucoma) in the better seeing eye (or in 1 eye if the fellow eye visual acuity was <20/200). Response data were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis and Rasch modeling. Poorly functioning items were eliminated, confirmatory factor analysis was used to ensure scale unidimensionality, and the model was refit to produce the final instrument.The final Low Vision Severely Constricted Peripheral Eyesight (LV-SCOPE) Questionnaire contains 53 items across 6 domains: mobility, object localization, object recognition, reading, social functioning, and technology. There were 74 items removed because of high missingness, poor factor loadings, low internal consistency, high local dependency, low item information, item redundancy, or differential item functioning. Using Rasch item calibrations, person ability scores could be calculated for each of the 6 unidimensional LV-SCOPE domains with good test-retest stability.The LV-SCOPE Questionnaire provides a valid and reliable measure of vision-related functioning across 6 key domains relevant to individuals with severe PFL.

The incidence in Yinzhou District estimated from the Yinzhou electronic health care record database was used to test the accuracy of the results from insurance data.A total of 95,555 patients with IBD were identified. The incidence in 2016 was 10.04 (95% confidence interval, 6.95-13.71) per 100,000 person-years. The incidence rates of both UC and CD were higher among males than among females. There was a sharp increase in UC incidence before the age of 30 years and stabilization in later years (50-79 years old), whereas CD incidence peaked at 30 to 34 years old and experienced decline subsequently. The incidence of UC was much greater than that of CD, with a UC-to-CD incidence ratio of 12.61. The results from the Yinzhou database confirmed these results.This study is the first to draw a portrait of the distribution of IBD in urban China. The difference in IBD incidence between urban China and other countries suggests an association between the IBD burden and industrialization process. The accelerating urbanization and industrialization process in China, a country with a population of 1.4 billion people, will likely increase the burden of IBD.",no,yes,no,other,,,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",2

However, classical morphologic features of CD may overlap with postoperative inflammatory changes, confounding the evaluation of anastomotic biopsies. There is a clear unmet need for better characterization of diagnostic and clinically significant histologic features of CD in these surgically altered sites. We evaluated ileocolonic and colocolonic/rectal anastomotic biopsies performed at 3 academic institutions in patients with and without CD. The biopsies were blindly assessed for CD histologic features and correlated to clinical and endoscopic characteristics. In CD patients, the presence of each feature was correlated with the subsequent clinical exacerbation or relapse. We obtained anastomotic biopsies from 208 patients, of which 109 were operated on for CD and 99 for another indication (neoplasia [80%], diverticular disease (11%), and other [9%]). Mean time since surgery was 10 years (0-59; 14 years for CD [1-59], 6 years for non-CD [0-33]). Endoscopic inflammation was noted in 52% of cases (68% for CD and 35% for non-CD). Microscopic inflammation was present in 74% of cases (82% for CD and 67% for non-CD). Only discontinuous lymphoplasmacytosis (P < .001) and pyloric gland metaplasia (P = .04) occurred significantly more often in CD patients. However, none of the histologic features predicted clinical disease progression. In subset analysis, the presence of histologic features of CD in nonanastomotic biopsies obtained concurrently in CD patients was significantly associated with relapse (P = .03). Due to extensive morphologic overlap between CD and postoperative changes and the lack of specific histologic features of relapse, biopsies from anastomotic sites are of no value in predicting clinical CD progression. Instead, CD activity in biopsies obtained away from anastomotic sites should be used for guiding endoscopic sampling and clinical management.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,diagnostic,,crohn's disease,2
2023-11-27,37700140,Genomic profile of diabetic retinopathy in a north indian cohort.,"Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is one of the major microvascular complications of diabetes. Being a complex disease, it is important to delineate the genetic and environmental factors that influence the susceptibility to DR in a population. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the role of genetic and lifestyle risk factors associated with DR susceptibility in a North-Indian population.A total of 848 subjects were enrolled, comprising of DR cases (n = 414) and healthy controls (n = 434). The Sequenom MassARRAY technology was used to perform target genome analysis of 111 SNPs across 57 candidate genes and 14 intergenic region SNPs that are involved in the metabolic pathways associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and DR. Allele, genotype and haplotype frequencies were determined and compared among cases and controls. Logistic regression models were used to determine genotype-phenotype and phenotype-phenotype correlations.The strongest association was observed with TCF7L2 rs12255372 T allele [p < 0.0001; odds ratio (OR) = 1.81 (1.44-2.27)] and rs11196205 C allele [p < 0.0008; OR = 1.62 (1.32-1.99)]. Genotype-phenotype and phenotype-phenotype correlations were found in the present study.Our study provides strong evidence of association between the TCF7L2 variants and DR susceptibility.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinopathy,2
2023-11-27,37702906,Looking into the Kinetics of NT-proBNP and sST2 Changes in Patients with Heart Failure Treated with Sacubitril/Valsartan: A Hint to Different Therapeutic Pathways.,"N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and soluble interleukin 1 receptor-like 1 ST2 (sST2) are biomarkers used to grade heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) severity. Both are potential targets of HFrEF treatment, but the first is associated with the patient's hemodynamic status, while the second is more indicative of the inflammatory status and of myocardial fibrosis. The aim of this study was to assess the kinetics of these biomarkers after treatment with sacubitril/valsartan in HFrEF.We analyzed blood samples of patients with HFrEF at baseline (before sacubitril/valsartan treatment), after 1, 2, and 3 months (respectively, after a month taking the 24/26 - 49/51 - 97/103 mg twice daily, or b.i.d., doses), and 6 months after the maximum-tolerated dose was reached (end study).We obtained samples from 72 patients with HFrEF (age 64.0 ± 10.5 years, 83% males). NT-proBNP and sST2 values progressively and significantly reduced to 37% and 16%, respectively, with a greater reduction for NT-proBNP (p < 0.001). Specifically, NT-proBNP reduced from 1144 [593-2586] pg/mL to 743 [358-1524] pg/mL and sST2 from 27.3 [20.5-35.0] ng/mL to 23.1 [15.9-30.7] ng/mL, p for trend < 0.001 in both cases. The reduction of the two biomarkers over time occurred with statistically significant different kinetics: deferred for sST2 and faster for NT-proBNP. No significant changes in renal function and potassium levels were recorded.These findings suggest that, in patients with HF, sacubitril/valsartan effects on the cardiovascular system share a double pathway: a first, hemodynamic, faster pathway and a second, non-hemodynamic anti-fibrotic, delayed one. Both likely contribute to the sacubitril/valsartan benefits in HFrEF.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,natriuretic,,2

2023-11-27,37741457,Proline provides a nitrogen source in the retinal pigment epithelium to synthesize and export amino acids for the neural retina.,"It is known that metabolic defects in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) can cause degeneration of its neighboring photoreceptors in the retina, leading to retinal degenerative diseases such as age-related macular degeneration. However, how RPE metabolism supports the health of the neural retina remains unclear. The retina requires exogenous nitrogen sources for protein synthesis, neurotransmission, and energy metabolism. Using 15N tracing coupled with mass spectrometry, we found human RPE can utilize the nitrogen in proline to produce and export 13 amino acids, including glutamate, aspartate, glutamine, alanine, and serine. Similarly, we found this proline nitrogen utilization in the mouse RPE/choroid but not in the neural retina of explant cultures. Coculture of human RPE with the retina showed that the retina can take up the amino acids, especially glutamate, aspartate, and glutamine, generated from proline nitrogen in the RPE. Intravenous delivery of 15N proline in vivo demonstrated 15N-derived amino acids appear earlier in the RPE before the retina. We also found proline dehydrogenase, the key enzyme in proline catabolism is highly enriched in the RPE but not the retina. The deletion of proline dehydrogenase blocks proline nitrogen utilization in RPE and the import of proline nitrogen-derived amino acids in the retina. Our findings highlight the importance of RPE metabolism in supporting nitrogen sources for the retina, providing insight into understanding the mechanisms of the retinal metabolic ecosystem and RPE-initiated retinal degenerative diseases.",no,yes,no,animal,biomarker,,retinal disease,2

Summary statistics for multiple kidney diseases were obtained from the publicly available GWAS. Genetic data from one GWAS involving 210 extensive T-cell traits was used to estimate the mediating effect on specific kidney disease. Inverse-variance weighted method were used to evaluate the MR estimates for primary analysis.Genetic predisposition to IBD was associated with higher risk of IgA nephropathy (IgAN) (OR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.45-2.19), but not membranous nephropathy, diabetic nephropathy, glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, and urolithiasis. CD4 expression on CD4 + T cell had a significant genetic association with the risk of IgAN (OR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.10-6.72). Additionally, consistent results were also observed when IBD was subclassified as ulcerative colitis (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.10-1.71) and Crohn's disease (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.12-1.68). MR-PRESSO and the MR-Egger intercept did not identify pleiotropic SNPs.This study provides genetic evidence supporting a positive casual association between IBD, including its subclassification as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and the risk of IgAN. However, no casual association was found between IBD and other types of kidney diseases. Further exploration of IBD interventions as potential preventive measures for IgAN is warranted.",no,yes,no,other,biomarker,,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",2

Here, we evaluated the utility of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in predicting incident adverse cardiovascular outcomes in prediabetic subjects.NT-proBNP was analyzed in 3,235 stable subjects with prediabetes undergoing cardiovascular risk evaluation and followed for both 3-year major adverse cardiac events (MACE; death, myocardial infarction, stroke), and 5-year all-cause mortality.Using Cox proportional hazard models, we found that plasma NT-proBNP was associated with incident (3-year) MACE risk (Q4 vs Q1, HR 6.04 [95%CI 4.17-8.76], P < 0.001) and 5-year mortality risk (HR 8.64 [95%CI 5.78-12.9], P < 0.001). These associations remained significant after adjustments for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, multiple indices of glycemic control, cardiovascular disease (CVD), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and medication (e.g. diuretic) use (adjusted HR for 3-year MACE 2.65 [95% CI 1.16-6.05], P < 0.05; and adjusted HR for 5-year mortality 3.45 [95% CI 1.42-8.39], P < 0.01). NT-proBNP significantly improved the clinical prognostic value (C-statistic, NRI, IDI) for both 3-year MACE and 5-year death when added to models.NT-proBNP independently predicts increased long-term MACE and mortality risks in prediabetic subjects, and may help identify those for whom more aggressive global preventive efforts are indicated.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,natriuretic,,2

Traditional screening that, rely on human experts are, however, costly, and time-consuming. The purpose of this systematic review is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of smartphone-based artificial intelligence(AI) systems for DR detection.Literature review was conducted on MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL Plus, and Cochrane from inception to December 2022. We included diagnostic test accuracy studies evaluating the use of smartphone-based AI algorithms for DR screening in patients with diabetes, with expert human grader as the reference standard. Random-effects model was used to pool sensitivity and specificity. Any DR(ADR) and referable DR(RDR) were analyzed separately.Out of 968 identified articles, six diagnostic test accuracy studies met our inclusion criteria, comprising 3,931 patients. Four of these studies used the Medios AI algorithm. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of ADR were 88 % and 91.5 % respectively and for diagnosis of RDR were 98.2 % and 81.2 % respectively. The overall risk of bias across the studies was low.Smartphone-based AI algorithms show high diagnostic accuracy for detecting DR.

UC is a complex multifactorial inflammatory disease. There are many invasive and non-invasive diagnostic methods in UC, including several laboratory markers which are employed in diagnosis and disease assessment; however, colonoscopy remains the most widely used method. Common laboratory abnormalities currently used in the clinical practice include inflammation-induced alterations, serum autoantibodies, and antibodies against bacterial antigens. Other new serum and fecal biomarkers are supportive in diagnosis and monitoring disease activity and therapy response; and potential salivary markers are currently being evaluated as well. Several UC-related genetic and epigenetic alterations are implied in its pathogenesis and therapeutic response.

These crucial vascular properties have been extensively investigated in eye development and disease utilizing genetic and experimental mouse models. However, due to technical limitations, individual studies have often restricted their focus to one specific sub-vasculature. Here, we apply a workflow that allows for visualization of complete vasculatures of mouse eyes of various developmental stages. Through tissue depigmentation, immunostaining, clearing and light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) entire vasculatures of the retina, vitreous (hyaloids) and uvea were simultaneously imaged at high resolution. In silico dissection provided detailed information on their 3D architecture and interconnections. By this method we describe successive remodeling of the postnatal iris vasculature, involving sprouting and pruning, following its disconnection from the embryonic feeding hyaloid vasculature. In addition, we demonstrate examples of conventional and LSFM-mediated analysis of choroidal neovascularization after laser-induced wounding, showing added value of the presented workflow in analysis of modelled eye disease.

We report a patient with HS with a new compound heterozygous PEX1 variant. Exon sequencing was used to screen pathologic variants in the patient. Retinal characteristics and serum metabolome alterations were evaluated. Scanning laser ophthalmoscope showed a large area of retinal choroidal atrophy at the posterior pole of the retina, with scattered patchy subretinal pigmentation. Optical coherence tomography showed fovea atrophy accompanied by retinal retinoschisis in the right eye and macular retinoschisis and edema in the left eye. The electroretinogram showed obviously reduced amplitudes of a-waves and b-waves under photopic and scotopic conditions in both eyes. Visual field tests showed a reduced central visual field in both eyes. Exon sequencing identified the compound heterozygous variant including c.2966T > C and c.1670+1G > T of the PEX1 gene, with the latter being novel.

2023-11-27,37884074,Duration-sensitive association between air pollution exposure and changes in cardiometabolic biomarkers: Evidence from a predominantly African American cohort.,"Ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure has been related to cardiometabolic diseases, but the underlying biological pathways remain unclear at the population level.To investigate the effect of PM2.5 exposure on changes in multiple cardiometabolic biomarkers across different exposure durations.Data from a prospective cohort study were analyzed. Ten cardiometabolic biomarkers were measured, including ghrelin, resistin, leptin, C-peptide, creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), troponin, and interleukin-6 (IL-6). PM2.5 levels across exposure durations from 1 to 36 months were assessed. Mixed effect model was used to estimate changes in biomarker levels against 1 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 level across different exposure durations.Totally, 641 participants were included. The average PM2.5 exposure level was 9 μg/m3. PM2.5 exposure was inversely associated with ghrelin, and positively associated with all other biomarkers. The magnitudes of these associations were duration-sensitive and exhibited a U-shaped or inverted-U-shaped trend. For example, the association of resistin were β = 0.05 (95% CI: 0.00, 0.09) for 1-month duration, strengthened to β = 0.27 (95% CI: 0.14, 0.41) for 13-month duration, and weakened to β = 0.12 (95% CI: -0.03, 0.26) for 24-month duration. Similar patterns were observed for other biomarkers except for CK-MB, of which the association direction switched from negative to positive as the duration increased. Resistin, leptin, MCP-1, TNF-alpha, and troponin had a sensitive exposure duration of nearly 12 months. Ghrelin and C-peptide were more sensitive to longer-term exposure (>18 months), while NT-proBNP and IL-6 were more sensitive to shorter-term exposure (<6 months).PM2.5 exposure was associated with elevated levels in cardiometabolic biomarkers related to insulin resistance, inflammation, and heart injury. The magnitudes of these associations depended on the exposure duration. The most sensitive exposure durations of different biomarkers varied.",yes,no,no,other,biomarker,natriuretic,,2

Neuroinflammation and demyelination of the optic nerve can lead to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death and axonal damage in MOGAD. Here, we aimed to evaluate the structural changes in RGCs longitudinally by in vivo imaging in mice with RGCs expressing yellow fluorescent protein along the course of EAE. Successful induction of EAE was confirmed by the neurological function scores and histology analyses. The changes in the thickness of ganglion cell complex (GCC) layer and RGC survival and dendrites were monitored longitudinally along the course of EAE. Before the onset of EAE, there were no significant changes in the number and morphology of RGCs and the thickness of the GCC layer as compared to the mice without EAE induction. After the onset of EAE, the thickness of the GCC layer and the RGC number and dendritic network all gradually decreased along the course of EAE. Notably, dendritic shrinkage could be detected earlier than the thinning of the GCC layer. In summary, this study delineated the longitudinal profile of RGC structural changes in EAE mice, providing an assessment platform for monitoring outcomes of RGC treatments.",no,yes,no,animal,biomarker,,retinal disease,2

In this study, we proposed DeepDrAMD, a hierarchical vision transformer-based deep learning model that integrates data augmentation techniques and SwinTransformer, to detect AMD and distinguish between different subtypes using color fundus photographs (CFPs). The DeepDrAMD was trained on the in-house WMUEH training set and achieved high performance in AMD detection with an AUC of 98.76% in the WMUEH testing set and 96.47% in the independent external Ichallenge-AMD cohort. Furthermore, the DeepDrAMD effectively classified dryAMD and wetAMD, achieving AUCs of 93.46% and 91.55%, respectively, in the WMUEH cohort and another independent external ODIR cohort. Notably, DeepDrAMD excelled at distinguishing between wetAMD subtypes, achieving an AUC of 99.36% in the WMUEH cohort. Comparative analysis revealed that the DeepDrAMD outperformed conventional deep-learning models and expert-level diagnosis. The cost-benefit analysis demonstrated that the DeepDrAMD offers substantial cost savings and efficiency improvements compared to manual reading approaches.

Elevated levels of MG have been correlated with micro-and macro-angiopathic complications in diabetes, including neuropathy, kidney disease, retinopathy, and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, point-of-care devices for detecting MG may be of great use in the screening of diabetes complications. This study was designed to determine the utility of the developed electrochemical biosensor to measure the level of MG in human plasma from type-2 diabetes mellitus patients. Electrochemical studies were carried out with optimized experimental parameters using the modified Platinum-electrode. Subsequently, clinical studies using 350 blood plasma samples were conducted and the results were validated against the ELISA kit, Normal Glucose Tolerance (NGT), and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c). The MG sensor exhibited a linear range of 1.0-7.5 μM concentration with a sensitivity of 1.02 mA µM-1, a limit of detection of 0.21 µM, a limit of quantification of 0.70 µM and a response time less than 10 s.

Several studies confirmed its accuracy in the assessment of the post-operative recurrence (POR). Thanks to recent advances in trans-perineal ultrasound technique (TPUS), it allows to characterize peri-anal disease and its complications. Small intestine contrast ultrasound (SICUS) and contrast-enhancement ultrasound (CEUS) may improve IUS performance, particularly in stricturing or penetrating CD. Ultrasound elastography (USE) is raising interest for its accuracy in differentiating CD phenotypes (fibrotic versus inflamed).IUS is a pivotal step in the management of CD, in early assessment as in therapeutic monitoring, with advantages of evaluating transmural response.

Single variant association analyses were performed for all identified common, low-frequency, and rare variants. Gene-based tests were executed for rare and low-frequency variants using SKAT-O and three groups of variants based on putative impact information: (1) all variants, (2) modifier impact variants, and (3) high- and moderate-impact variants. To ascertain independence of the identified associations from previously reported AMD and asthma loci, conditional analyses were performed.Previously identified AMD variants at the CFH, ARMS2/HTRA1, APOE, and C3 loci were associated with AMD at a genome-wide significance level. We identified new single variant associations for common variants near the PARK7 gene and in the long non-coding RNA AC103876.1, and for a rare variant near the TENM3 gene. In addition, gene-based association analyses identified a burden of modifier variants in eight intergenic and gene-spanning regions and of high- and moderate-impact variants in the C3, CFHR5, SLC16A8, and CFI genes.We describe the largest WGS study in AMD to date.

Genotype-phenotype correlations for Usher syndrome type 2 (USH2) suggest that the USH2A gene exhibits an allelic hierarchy. Here, we analyzed the phenotypes and genotypes of 16 South Korean patients with USH2A biallelic variants to investigate an allelic hierarchy from audiological and ophthalmological perspectives. Using whole exome and genome sequencing, 18 mutant alleles, including 4 novel alleles, were identified and implicated in USH2A-related disorders. Truncated alleles were linked to earlier onset of subjective hearing loss and more severe thresholds; biallelic truncated alleles had more severe effects. Truncated alleles were also associated with retinal structure degeneration and severe functional deterioration. However, younger patients (aged < 16 years) did not exhibit overt retinitis pigmentosa even when they had biallelic truncated alleles, suggesting that USH2A-related USH2 can mimic nonsyndromic hearing loss.

2023-11-27,37981775,"[The mechanism by which hsa_circRNA_103124 highly expressed in peripheral blood of patients with active Crohn's disease regulates macrophage differentiation, pyroptosis and inflammation].","Objective: To investigate the role and related mechanism of the highly expressed circular RNA molecule 103124 (hsa_circRNA_103124) in macrophage differentiation, pyroptosis and inflammation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with active Crohn's disease (CD). Methods: Patients with active CD (CD group) admitted to the Affiliated Suzhou Hospital of Nanjing Medical University from April to September 2018 and healthy people (control group) from the physical examination center of the hospital from July to October 2018 were retrospectively selected. The levels of hsa_circRNA_103124 and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in PBMC of the two groups were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Tohoku hospital pediatrics-1 (THP1) cell line was used as a model for the study of hsa_circRNA_103124 regulating macrophage differentiation. Lentivirus infection was used to construct hsa_circRNA_103124 overexpressed or down-regulated THP1 cells to induce macrophage-like differentiation. According to the expression level of hsa_circRNA_103124, THP1 cell lines were divided into the following four groups: pLC5-ciR was overexpression control group; hsa_circRNA_103124 OE was the overexpression group; ShRNActrl was down-regulated expression control group; hsa_circRNA_103124 ShRNA was the down-regulated expression group. Flow cytometry was used to detect levels cluster of differentiation (CD) 68, CD80, interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The expression levels of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, TLR4 and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) were detected by RT-qPCR. The levels of gasdermin D (GSDMD), IL-18 and NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 (NLRP3) were determined by immunofluorescence and RT-qPCR. Pearson correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between the abundance of hsa_circRNA_103124 and TLR4 expression level or Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI). Results: A total of 50 patients were included in the CD group, including 36 males and 14 females, aged (35±10) (19-64) years. A total of 30 subjects were included in the control group, including 22 males and 8 females, aged (38±9) (24-64) years. hsa_circRNA_103124 [(0.009±0.016) vs (0.003±0.002), P=0.042] and TLR4 [(0.005±0.003) vs (0.001±0.001), P<0.001] were all upregulated in the PBMC of patients in the CD group, compared with the control group. And hsa_circRNA_103124 was positively correlated with TLR4 (r=0.40, P=0.004). hsa_circRNA_103124 level was positively correlated with CDAI (r=0.32, P=0.024). The expression of CD68 (P=0.002) and CD80 (P<0.001) were enhanced. hsa_circRNA_103124 promoted production of ROS and the expression of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, TLR4, MyD88, GSDMD, IL-18 and NLRP3 in macrophage-like M1 differentiated THP1 cells (all P<0.05). Conclusion: High expresion of hsa_circRNA_103124 in PBMC of patients with active CD may promote macrophage M1 differentiation, pyroptosis and inflammation through enhancing the expression of TLR4, MyD88, NLRP3 and GSDMD.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,crohn's disease,2

The technology's clinical impact of AOSLO hinges on early detection through automated analysis tools.We introduce Cone Density Estimation (CoDE) and CoDE for Diagnosis (CoDED). CoDE is a deep density estimation model for cone counting that estimates a density function whose integral is equal to the number of cones. CoDED is an integration of CoDE with deep image classifiers for diagnosis. We use two AOSLO image datasets to train and evaluate the performance of cone density estimation and classification models for retinitis pigmentosa and Stargardt's disease.Bland-Altman plots show that CoDE outperforms state-of-the-art models for cone density estimation. CoDED reported an F1 score of 0.770 ± 0.04 for disease classification, outperforming traditional convolutional networks.CoDE shows promise in classifying the retinitis pigmentosa and Stargardt's disease cases from a single AOSLO image. Our preliminary results suggest the potential role of analyzing patterns in the retinal cellular mosaic to aid in the diagnosis of genetic eye diseases.Our study explores the potential of deep density estimation models to aid in the analysis of AOSLO images. Although the initial results are encouraging, more research is needed to fully realize the potential of such methods in the treatment and study of genetic retinal pathologies.",no,yes,no,other,diagnostic,,retinal disease,2
2023-11-27,37984844,"""Meiosis arrester"" C-natriuretic peptide directly stimulates oocyte mtDNA accumulation and is implicated in aging-associated oocyte mtDNA loss.","C-natriuretic peptide (CNP) is the central regulator of oocyte meiosis progression, thus coordinating synchronization of oocyte nuclear-cytoplasmic maturation. However, whether CNP can independently regulate cytoplasmic maturation has been long overlooked. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) accumulation is the hallmark event of cytoplasmic maturation, but the mechanism underlying oocyte mtDNA replication remains largely elusive. Herein, we report that CNP can directly stimulate oocyte mtDNA replication at GV stage, and deficiency of follicular CNP may contribute largely to lower mtDNA copy number in in vitro matured oocytes. The mechanistic study showed that cAMP-PKA-CREB1 signaling cascade underlies the regulatory role of CNP in stimulating mtDNA replication and upregulating related genes. Of interest, we also report that CNP-NPR2 signaling is inhibited in aging follicles, and this inhibition is implicated in lower mtDNA copy number in oocytes from aging females. Together, our study provides the first direct functional link between follicular CNP and oocyte mtDNA replication, and identifies its involvement in aging-associated mtDNA loss in oocytes. These findings, not only update the current knowledge of the functions of CNP in coordinating oocyte maturation but also present a promising strategy for improving in vitro fertilization outcomes of aging females.",yes,no,no,other,biomarker,natriuretic,,2
2023-11-27,37985786,Circulating thyroid hormones and clinical parameters of heart failure in men.,"Heart failure (HF) is a multiple hormonal deficiency syndrome which includes alterations in the serum concentration of thyroid hormones (TH). This cross-sectional study enrolled 215 male patients hospitalised for acute HF. Data on cardiovascular risk factors, chronic medications, cardiac function assessed by echocardiography, and clinical parameters of HF were prospectively collected. The independent predictive association of TH with all investigated parameters of the HF severity were assessed. The patient's mean age was 74.4 years, 57.2% had arterial hypertension, 54.0% were consuming alcohol, and 42.3% were diabetics. Multivariate analysis revealed that total triiodothyronine (TT3) was an independent predictor of greater left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; β = 0.223, p = 0.008), less progressed left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD; β = - 0.271, p = 0.001) and lower N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP; β = - 0.365, p < 0.001). None of the TH other than TT3 was associated with LVDD or NT-proBNP, whereas free triiodothyronine (β = - 0.197, p = 0.004), free thyroxine (β = - 0.223, p = 0.001) and total thyroxine (β = - 0.140, p = 0.041) were inversely associated with LVEF.

The plasma levels of VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and GDF-15 were measured using ELISA. Their correlations with N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-Pro BNP) and echocardiography data were analyzed. 1. Higher plasma levels of VEGF-D and GDF-15 were observed in elderly patients with cardiovascular disease and heart failure(P < .01). VEGF-D plasma levels were higher in patients with chronic heart failure than those with acute myocardial infarction (P < .01). VEGF-D plasma levels were positively correlated with amino-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP) (P < .001). VEGF-D plasma levels were positively correlated with echocardiographic parameters, including left atrial diameter, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and left ventricular ejection fraction, in patients with cardiovascular disease (P < .01). 2. VEGF-C plasma levels were higher in acute myocardial infarction group (P < .05). The plasma levels of VEGF-C were not correlated with either VEGF-D or NT-pro BNP plasma levels. VEGF-C plasma levels had no correlation with echocardiographic parameters. 3. GDF-15 plasma levels were positively correlated with sera biomarkers of cardiac injury (creatine kinase isoenzyme MB and cardiac troponin I). GDF-15 plasma levels were positively correlated with urinary biomarkers of tubular injury (N-acetyl-β-galactosidase and α1-microglobulin). Both GDF-15 and NT-pro BNP plasma levels were correlated with age, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and nutritional biomarkers (albumin and hemoglobin plasma levels). VEGF-D plasma levels is a potential biomarker of fluid overload and cardiac function in elderly patients with cardiovascular disease.

Patients with complete outer retinal and retinal pigment epithelium atrophy secondary to either EMAP (EMAP Group) or to dry age related macular degeneration (AMD group) were retrospectively selected. Fovea-centered posterior pole (30° × 30°) and 55° × 55° degree-field-of-view FAF images of sufficiently high quality were collected and used to train two different deep learning (DL) classifiers based on ResNet-101 design. Testing was performed on a set of images coming from a different center. A total of 300 patients were recruited, 135 belonging to EMAP group and 165 belonging to AMD group. The 30° × 30° FAF based DL classifier showed a sensitivity of 84.6% and a specificity of 85.3% for the diagnosis of EMAP. The 55° × 55° FAF based DL classifier showed a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 84.6%, a performance that was significantly higher than that of the 30° × 30° classifer (p = 0.037).

The methodological quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The quantitative calculation was performed using Review Manager V.5.3.Twelve studies met the eligibility criteria and were included. DON group presented lower macular ganglion cell complex in the overall, superior and inferior hemifields compared with the non-DON group. Furthermore, the ganglion cell layer and inner plexiform layer in DON group was thinner in contrast to the non-DON group. The optic nerve head vessel density was lower in the DON group than that in the non-DON group. A reduction of radial peripapillary capillary vessel density could be seen in the DON group than the non-DON group in overall, inside disc, peripapillary, superior-hemifield, temporal and nasal. Besides, the macular superficial retinal capillary layer of non-DON and DON is lower than the healthy control group.This study supported the potential value of OCT and OCTA metrics as novel biomarkers of DON. Ophthalmologists should comprehensively consider the retinal structure and microvasculature in dealing with DON.This systematic review included data from published literature and was exempt from ethics approval.

However, data on early DWI signal evolution are missing.Consecutive CRAO patients with DWI performed within 24 h after onset of visual impairment were included in a bicentric, retrospective cross-sectional study. Two blinded neuroradiologists assessed randomized DWI scans for the presence of retinal ischemia. RDR detection rates, false positive ratings, and interrater agreement were evaluated for predefined time groups.Sixty eight CRAO patients (68.4 ± 16.8 years; 25 female) with 72 DWI scans (76.4% 3 T, 23.6% 1.5 T) were included. Mean time-delay between onset of CRAO and DWI acquisition was 13.4 ± 7.0 h. Overall RDR detection rates ranged from 52.8% to 62.5% with false positive ratings in 4.2%-8.3% of cases. RDR detection rates were higher in DWI performed 12-24 h after onset, when compared with DWI acquired within the first 12 h (79.5%vs 39.3%, p < 0.001). The share of false positive ratings was highest for DWI performed within the first 6 h of symptom onset (up to 14.3%). Interrater reliability was ""moderate"" for DWI performed within the first 18 h (κ = 0.57-0.58), but improved for DWI acquired between 18 and 24 h (κ = 0.94).DWI-based detection of retinal ischemia in early CRAO is likely to be time-dependent with superior diagnostic accuracy for DWI performed 12-24 h after onset of visual impairment.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,diagnostic,,retinal disease,2
2023-11-27,37998336,COVID-19 and Alzheimer's Disease Share Common Neurological and Ophthalmological Manifestations: A Bidirectional Risk in the Post-Pandemic Future.,"A growing body of evidence indicates that a neuropathological cross-talk takes place between the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) -the pandemic severe pneumonia that has had a tremendous impact on the global economy and health since three years after its outbreak in December 2019- and Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia among human beings, reaching 139 million by the year 2050. Even though COVID-19 is a primary respiratory disease, its causative agent, the so-called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is also endowed with high neuro-invasive potential (Neurocovid). The neurological complications of COVID-19, resulting from the direct viral entry into the Central Nervous System (CNS) and/or indirect systemic inflammation and dysregulated activation of immune response, encompass memory decline and anosmia which are typically associated with AD symptomatology. In addition, patients diagnosed with AD are more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection and are inclined to more severe clinical outcomes. In the present review, we better elucidate the intimate connection between COVID-19 and AD by summarizing the involved risk factors/targets and the underlying biological mechanisms shared by these two disorders with a particular focus on the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, APOlipoprotein E (APOE), aging, neuroinflammation and cellular pathways associated with the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP)/Amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau neuropathologies. Finally, the involvement of ophthalmological manifestations, including vitreo-retinal abnormalities and visual deficits, in both COVID-19 and AD are also discussed.

Melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) rs17782313 polymorphism has been linked to common obesity with varying influence across different populations. MC4R is a crucial player in the leptin proopiomelanocortin pathway that regulates weight hemostasis. We aimed to study MC4R rs17782313 and its interaction with eating behaviors on obesity predisposition in the Israeli population. Adults' (n = 5785, >18 y) genotype and anthropometric and demographic data were analyzed using logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex, T1DM, and T2DM. MC4R rs17782313 significantly predisposes to elevated obesity risk under the recessive and additive models (OR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.1-1.72, p = 0.005 and OR = 1.1, 95% CI: 1.01-1.2, p = 0.03, respectively) adjusted for confounders (age, sex, T1DM, and T2DM). Stratification by sex demonstrated that carrying the common MC4R rs17782313 is significantly associated with an elevated predisposition to obesity under the recessive model among females only (OR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.09-1.82, p = 0.01), with an average of 0.85 BMI increment compared with wild type and one risk allele carriers.

2023-11-27,38002999,A Molecular Genetic Analysis of RPE65-Associated Forms of Inherited Retinal Degenerations in the Russian Federation.,"Pathogenic variants in the RPE65 gene cause the only known form of inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs) that are prone to gene therapy. The current study is aimed at the evaluation of the prevalence of RPE65-associated retinopathy in the Russian Federation, the characterization of known variants in the RPE65 gene, and the establishment of the specificities of the mutation spectrum in Russian patients.The analysis was carried out on blood samples obtained from 1053 non-related IRDs patients. The analysis, which consisted of 211 genes, was carried out based on the method of massive parallel sequencing (MPS) for all probands. Variant validation, as well as biallelic status verification, were carried out using direct automated Sanger sequencing. The number of copies of RPE65 exons 1-14 was analyzed with quantitative MLPA using an MRC-Holland SALSA MLPA probemix.Out of 1053 non-related patients, a molecular genetic diagnosis of IRDs has been confirmed in 474 cases, including 25 (5.3%) patients with RPE65-associated retinopathy. We detected 26 variants in the RPE65 gene, nine of which have not been previously described in the literature. The most common mutations in the Russian population were c.304G>T/p.(Glu102*), c.370C>T/p.(Arg124*), and c.272G>A/p.(Arg91Gln), which comprised 41.8% of all affected chromosomes.The current study shows that pathogenic variants in the RPE65 gene contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of IRDs and comprise 5.3% of all patients with a confirmed molecular genetic diagnosis.

2023-11-27,38003595,Systemic Evidence for Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Age-Related Macular Degeneration as Revealed by mtDNA Copy Number Measurements in Peripheral Blood.,"Mitochondrial dysfunction is a common occurrence in the aging process and is observed in diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Increased levels of reactive oxygen species lead to damaged mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), resulting in dysfunctional mitochondria, and, consequently, mtDNA causes further harm in the retinal tissue. However, it is unclear whether the effects are locally restricted to the high-energy-demanding retinal pigment epithelium or are also systematically present. Therefore, we measured mtDNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) in peripheral blood using a qPCR approach with plasmid normalization in elderly participants with and without AMD from the AugUR study (n = 2262). We found significantly lower mtDNA-CN in the blood of participants with early (n = 453) and late (n = 170) AMD compared to AMD-free participants (n = 1630). In regression analyses, we found lower mtDNA-CN to be associated with late AMD when compared with AMD-free participants. Each reduction of mtDNA-CN by one standard deviation increased the risk for late AMD by 24%. This association was most pronounced in geographic atrophy (OR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.19-2.60, p = 0.004), which has limited treatment options. These findings provide new insights into the relationship between mtDNA-CN in blood and AMD, suggesting that it may serve as a more accessible biomarker than mtDNA-CN in the retina.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinopathy,2
2023-11-27,38003983,Ultrasound Prevalence and Clinical Features of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: A Real-Life Cross-Sectional Study.,"Background and Objectives: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a condition characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation. We can identify two major forms: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). One of the extraintestinal manifestations of IBD is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). IBD and NAFLD share common pathogenetic mechanisms. Ultrasound (US) examination is the most commonly used imaging method for the diagnosis of NAFLD. This cross-sectional observational retrospective study aimed to evaluate the US prevalence of NAFLD in IBD patients and their clinical features. Materials and Methods: A total of 143 patients with IBD underwent hepatic US and were divided into two different groups according to the presence or absence of NAFLD. Subsequently, new exclusion criteria for dysmetabolic comorbidities (defined as plus) were applied. Results: The US prevalence of NAFLD was 23% (21% in CD and 24% in UC, respectively). Most IBD-NAFLD patients were male and older and showed significantly higher values for body mass index, waist circumference, disease duration, and age at onset than those without NAFLD. IBD-NAFLD patients showed a significantly higher percentage of stenosing phenotype and left-side colitis. Regarding metabolic features, IBD-NAFLD patients showed a significantly higher percentage of hypertension and IBD plus dysmetabolic criteria. Also, higher values of alanine aminotransferase and triglycerides and lower levels of high-density lipoproteins are reported in these patients. Conclusions: We suggest performing liver US screening in subjects affected by IBD to detect NAFLD earlier. Also, patients with NAFLD present several metabolic comorbidities that would fall within the new definition of metabolic-associated fatty liver disease. Finally, we encourage larger longitudinal studies, including healthy controls, to provide further confirmation of our preliminary data.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"diagnostic, biomarker",,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",2

This systematic review synthesises the literature on micronutrient insufficiency in CD in clinical remission in terms of the prevalence of low circulating micronutrient concentrations and as a comparison against a healthy control (HC). Studies were included if the population was predominantly in remission. A total of 42 studies met the inclusion criteria; 12 were rated as low quality, leaving 30 studies covering 21 micronutrients of medium/high quality that were included in the synthesis. Vitamins D and B12 were the most frequently reported nutrients (8 and 11); there were few eligible studies for the remaining micronutrients. The prevalence studies were consistent in reporting individuals with low Vitamins A, B6, B12 and C, β-carotene, D, Magnesium, Selenium and Zinc. The comparator studies were inconsistent in finding differences with CD populations; Vitamin D, the most reported nutrient, was only lower than the HC in one-quarter of the studies. Adult CD populations are likely to contain individuals with low levels of one or more micronutrients, with the most substantial evidence for Vitamins D and B12.

A substantial increase in the burden of AMD is expected in the aging populations, including the Iranians. We investigated the age and gender-specific prevalence of AMD and its determinants in Iran.We systematically searched international (PubMed, Scopus, Embase, etc.) and local (IranDoc, Magiran, etc.) online databases. We included cross-sectional or cohort studies, either clinic- or population-based, published on the prevalence of AMD among Iranians, with no limitation on age. Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) tools for critical appraisal were used. Prevalence estimates are pooled by applying random-effects modeling. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were performed.Seventeen studies with 16,120 participants were included. Based on studies in general population, the pooled prevalence of AMD was 10.8% (95% CI: 6.5-16.2%) in males, and 9.8% (95% CI: 4.7-16.4%) in females. 8.5% of moderate vision impaired, 13.6% of severe vision impaired, and 15.7% of blind participants were affected by AMD. The prevalence of AMD was 2% in 40-49, and 32.3% in the ≥ 80 population. The prevalence of AMD was 11.9% among the visually impaired vs. 8.7% in the general population. The study's sampling method, location, and mean age were correlated with the heterogeneities of the prevalence. We observed an increasing trend in the number of AMD cases (average annual percent change = 3.66%; 95% CI: 3.65-3.67%) from 1990 to 2050. The expected number of AMD cases in Iran will be near 5.5 million by 2050.The prevalence of AMD in Iran was somewhere between the prevalence of Asians and Europeans. Given the aging trend of the Iranian community and an average annual percent change of 3.66%, it is indispensable to adopt preventive and screening policies to diminish the burden of the disease in the future decades.",no,yes,yes,human non-RCT,"diagnostic, biomarker",,retinal disease,2

2023-11-28,37459966,Necroptosis in human cancers with special emphasis on oral squamous cell carcinoma.,"Necroptosis is a type of caspase independent 'programmed or regulated' necrotic cell death that has a morphological resemblance to necrosis and mechanistic analogy to apoptosis. This type of cell death requires RIPK1, RIPK3, MLKL, death receptors, toll like receptors, interferons, and various other proteins. Necroptosis is implicated in plethora of diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, Crohn's disease, and head and neck cancers including oral squamous cell carcinoma. Oral carcinomas show dysregulation or mutation of necroptotic proteins, mediate antitumoral immunity, activate immune response and control tumor progression. Necroptosis is known to play a dual role (pro tumorigenic and anti-tumorigenic) in cancer progression and targeting this pathway could be an effective approach in cancer therapy. Necroptosis based chemotherapy has been proposed in malignancies, highlighting the importance of necroptotic pathway to overcome apoptosis resistance and serve as a ""fail-safe"" pathway to modulate cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis. However, there is dearth of information regarding the use of necroptotic cell death mechanism in the treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma. In this review, we summarise molecular mechanism of necroptosis, and its protumorigenic and antitumorigenic role in cancers to shed light on the possible therapeutic significance of necroptosis in oral squamous cell carcinoma.",no,yes,no,other,,,crohn's disease,2
2023-11-28,37525049,Human Breast Milk Omics and Neurodevelopment.,"Breast milk is the ideal food for the premature and mature babies and has undoubtedly immediate and ultimate benefits. Among other things, it protects against infections, reduces the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis and retinopathy of the premature babies, improves neurodevelopmental outcome, and reduces the risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome later in life. In the present study, breast milk will be studied with all the available omics technologies. More specifically, functional genomics, comparative genomics, transcriptomics, sequencing, proteomics, and metabolomics will be performed. The above results and this multidimensional information will be coordinated under the framework of a holistic approach of systems biology and bioinformatic analysis. Important IncRNAs and protein molecules will be validated as candidate biomarkers in exosomes of a larger group of breast milk and blood/serum samples. Validated ncRNAs/proteins will be analyzed in exudates of breast milk and bovine, goat, and sheep milk to explore new ways to improve milk synthesis. Expression of ncRNAs, unlike mRNAs, is a direct indicator of their functional presence. The information to be generated in this study will be analyzed by mining and data combining techniques and algorithms. After defining breast milk molecular fingerprinting, an attempt will be made to enhance the commercial product. The benefits of breast milk are attributed to its various components, including nutrients, hormones, growth factors, immune cells, antibodies, cytokines, antimicrobial peptides, and extracellular vesicles.",no,yes,no,other,biomarker,,retinopathy,2
2023-11-28,37743520,Prognostic Importance of B-Type Natriuretic Peptide Level in Patients Undergoing Catheter Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation.,"This study assessed the prognostic importance of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentrations for clinical events after catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF).Methods and Results: We enrolled 1,750 consecutive patients undergoing initial AF ablation whose baseline BNP data were available from a large-scale multicenter observational cohort (TRANQUILIZE-AF Registry). The prognostic impact of BNP concentration on clinical outcomes, including recurrent tachyarrhythmias and a composite of heart failure (HF) hospitalization or cardiac death, was evaluated. Median baseline BNP was 94.2 pg/mL. During a median follow-up of 2.4 years, low BNP (<38.3 pg/mL) was associated with lower rates of recurrent atrial tachyarrhythmias than BNP concentrations ≥38.3 pg/mL (19.9% vs. 30.6% at 3 years; P<0.001) and HF (0.8% vs. 5.3% at 3 years; P<0.001). Multivariable Cox regression analyses revealed that low BNP was independently associated with lower risks of arrhythmia recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47-0.82; P<0.001) and HF (HR 0.17; 95% CI 0.04-0.71; P=0.002). The favorable impact of low BNP on arrhythmia recurrence was prominent in patients with paroxysmal, but not non-paroxysmal, AF, particularly among those with long-standing AF.Low BNP concentrations had a favorable impact on clinical outcomes after AF ablation. The heterogeneous impact of baseline BNP concentrations on arrhythmia recurrence for the subgroups of patients divided by AF type warrants future larger studies with longer follow-up periods.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,natriuretic,,2
2023-11-28,37797393,Long non-coding RNAs: The hidden players in diabetes mellitus-related complications.,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been recognized as important regulators of gene expression in various human diseases. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a long-term metabolic disorder associated with serious macro and microvascular complications. This review discusses the potential lncRNAs involved in DM-related complications such as dysfunction of pancreatic beta islets, nephropathy, retinopathy, cardiomyopathy, and peripheral neuropathy.An extensive literature search was conducted in the Scopus database to find information from reputed biomedical articles published on lncRNAs and diabetic complications from 2014 to 2023. All review articles were collected and statistically analyzed, and the findings were summarized. In addition, the potential lncRNAs involved in DM-related complications, molecular mechanisms, and gene targets were discussed in detail.The lncRNAs ANRIL, E33, MALAT1, PVT1, Erbb4-IR, Gm4419, Gm5524, MIAT, MEG3, KNCQ1OT1, Uc.48+, BC168687, HOTAIR, and NONRATT021972 were upregulated in several diabetic complications. However, βlinc1, H19, PLUTO, MEG3, GAS5, uc.322, HOTAIR, MIAT, TUG1, CASC2, CYP4B1-PS1-001, SOX2OT, and Crnde were downregulated. Remarkably, lncRNAs MALAT1, ANRIL, MIAT, MEG3, H19, and HOTAIR were overlapping in more than one diabetic complication and were considered potential lncRNAs.Several lncRNAs are identified as regulators of DM-related complications. The expression of lncRNAs is up or downregulated depending on the disease context, target genes, and regulatory partners. However, most lncRNAs target oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, fibrosis, and angiogenesis pathways to mediate their protective/pathogenic mechanism of action and contribute to DM-related complications.",no,yes,yes,other,biomarker,,retinopathy,2
2023-11-28,37932687,RB1 screening of retinoblastoma patients in Sri Lanka using targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) and gene ratio analysis copy enumeration PCR (GRACE-PCR).,"Retinoblastoma (RB) a tumour affecting those under 5 years, has a prevalence of 1 in 20,000, with around twenty new diagnoses per year in Sri Lanka. Unilateral and bilateral RB presents around 24 and 15 months respectively. Approximately 10% are familial. Systematic genetic testing for germline pathogenic variants of RB1, the only gene associated with an inherited risk of RB, is unavailable in Sri Lanka. Genetic testing optimizes management of affected children and at-risk siblings. This study aimed to develop accessible genetic testing to identify children with a germline pathogenic variant of RB1 in Sri Lanka.Targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) for detecting pathogenic sequence variants and Gene Ratio Analysis Copy Enumeration PCR (GRACE-PCR) for detecting RB1 copy number variations (CNVs) were performed for 49 consecutive RB patients treated between 2016 and 2020 at the designated RB care unit, Lady Ridgway hospital, Colombo. Patients (bilateral RB (n = 18; 37%), unilateral n = 31) were recruited following ethical clearance and informed consent.There were 26 (53%) females. Mean age at diagnosis was 18 months. Thirty-five patients (71%) had undergone enucleation. Germline pathogenic variants of RB1 identified in 22/49 (45%) patients including 18 (37%; 12 bilateral and 6 unilateral) detected by targeted NGS (2 missense, 7 stop gained, 1 splice donor, 8 frameshift variants). Six were previously undescribed, likely pathogenic frameshift variants. Four bilateral RB patients had GRACE-PCR detected CNVs including one whole RB1, two intragenic deletions (exon 12/13; exon 11 and 23) and a partial duplication of exon 27. The only familial case (affected mother and child) shared the duplication. Only 2 of 4 CNVs and 10 of 18 pathogenic variants were confirmed by whole exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing respectively, due to funding limitations.The study identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline RB1 sequence variants and copy number variants in 16/18 (89%) bilateral and 6/31(19%) unilateral cases, which is comparable to worldwide data (10-15% unilateral, 80-85% bilateral). Targeted NGS combined with GRACE-PCR significantly reduce the cost of RB1 testing in Sri Lanka, and may widen access for genetic diagnosis of RB patients in other low and middle income countries.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,"diagnostic, biomarker",,retinoblastoma,2
2023-11-28,38002312,Vitreous Levels of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor and Platelet-Derived Growth Factor in Patients with Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy: A Clinical Correlation.,"Background: The global epidemic status of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and its burden presents an ongoing challenge to health-care systems. It is of great interest to investigate potential prognostic biomarkers of DR. Such markers could aid in detecting early stages of DR, predicting DR progression and its response to therapeutics. Herein, we investigate the prognostic value of intravitreal concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in a DR cohort. Materials and methods: Vitreous sample acquisition was conducted at King Abdullah University Hospital (KAUH) between December 2020 and June 2022. Samples were obtained from any patient scheduled to undergo a pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) for any indication. Included patients were categorized into a DR group or a corresponding non-diabetic (ND) control group. Demographics, clinicopathological variables, standardized laboratory tests results, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) data were obtained for each included individual. Intravitreal concentrations of VEGF and PDGF were assessed using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: A total of 80 eyes from 80 patients (DR group: n = 42 and ND control group: n = 38) were included in the analysis. The vitreous VEGF levels were significantly higher in the DR group compared to the ND control group (DR group 5744.06 ± 761.5 pg/mL versus ND control group 817.94 ± 403.1 pg/mL, p = 0.0001). In addition, the vitreous PDGF levels were also significantly higher in the DR group than those in the ND control group (DR group 4031.51 ± 410.2 pg/mL versus ND control group 2691.46 ± 821.0 pg/mL, p = 0.001). Bassline differences between test groups and clinical factors impacting VEGF and PDGF concentrations were investigated as well. Multiple regression analysis indicated PDGF as the sole independent risk factor affecting best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at the last follow-up visit: the higher the PDGF vitreous levels, the worst the BCVA. Conclusions: Vitreous concentrations of VEGF and PDGF are correlated with DR severity and may exhibit a possible prognostic potential value in DR. Further clinical and experimental data are warranted to confirm the observed findings and to help incorporate them into daily practice.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinopathy,2

However, concern about insufficient training and perceived high inter-observer variability limit the adoption of IUS in CD. We examined the diagnostic accuracy of trainee-performed IUS in patients with suspected CD.Patients recruited to a prospective trial investigating the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance enterocolonography (MREC) in patients with clinically suspected CD underwent IUS performed by trainees. The primary end-point was IUS per-patient sensitivity and specificity for ileocolonic CD determined by ileocolonoscopy.129 patients with clinically suspected CD and a complete IC and IUS were included in the analysis. IUS detected signs of CD in 49 cases (small bowel 31, colon 15, small bowel, and colon 3). The sensitivity and specificity for detection of ileocolonic CD by trainee performed IUS improved during the first to the second half of the study period from 57.1% (CI 34.0-78.2) to 73.1% (CI 52.2-88.4) and 76.5% (CI 58.8-89.3) to 89.7% (CI 72.6-97.8). The overall sensitivity and specificity of diagnosing CD with IUS were 65.4% (CI 50.9-78.0) and 80.5% (CI 69.9-88.7). There was no difference in diagnostic performance between IUS and MREC for the detection of CD.Trainees improved during the study, and IUS performance in disease detection corresponded to expert-evaluated MREC.Registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03134586).",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,diagnostic,,crohn's disease,2
2023-11-29,37667563,Diagnostic properties of natriuretic peptides and opportunities for personalized thresholds for detecting heart failure in primary care.,"Heart failure (HF) is a prevalent syndrome with considerable disease burden, healthcare utilization and costs. Timely diagnosis is essential to improve outcomes. This study aimed to compare the diagnostic performance of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP) in detecting HF in primary care. Our second aim was to explore if personalized thresholds (using age, sex, or other readily available parameters) would further improve diagnostic accuracy over universal thresholds.A retrospective study was performed among patients without prior HF who underwent natriuretic peptide (NP) testing in the Amsterdam General Practice Network between January 2011 and December 2021. HF incidence was based on registration out to 90 days after NP testing. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated with AUROC, sensitivity and specificity based on guideline-recommended thresholds (125 ng/L for NT-proBNP and 35 ng/L for BNP). We used inverse probability of treatment weighting to adjust for confounding.A total of 15,234 patients underwent NP testing, 6,870 with BNP (4.5 % had HF), and 8,364 with NT-proBNP (5.7 % had HF). NT-proBNP was more accurate than BNP, with an AUROC of 89.9 % (95 % CI: 88.4-91.2) vs. 85.9 % (95 % CI 83.5-88.2), with higher sensitivity (95.3 vs. 89.7 %) and specificity (59.1 vs. 58.0 %). Differentiating NP cut-off by clinical variables modestly improved diagnostic accuracy for BNP and NT-proBNP compared with a universal threshold.NT-proBNP outperforms BNP for detecting HF in primary care.

2023-11-29,37776150,Relationship of atrial fibrillation and N terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide in heart failure patients.,"N terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) plays an important role in the diagnosis and prognosis of heart failure (HF). The plasma level of NT-proBNP in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients was higher than of sinus rhythm patients. In HF, NT-proBNP levels are affected by the concomitant presence of AF, making it difficult to distinguish between HF and AF in patients with elevated NT-proBNP. Several other diseases, such as renal failure and pulmonary embolism, are known to further increase NT-proBNP levels in patients with concomitant HF. Therefore, NT-proBNP is a sensitive but non-specific marker for the detection of HF. AF is very important in this regard because among patients with HF regardless of ejection fraction, symptoms such as shortness of breath and atrial enlargement develop and can mimic HF. In the present study, we investigated whether the prognostic value of natriuretic peptides in HF holds true for patients with concomitant AF.",yes,no,no,other,"diagnostic, biomarker",natriuretic,,2
2023-11-29,37796395,Advances in Screening for Radiation-Associated Cardiotoxicity in Cancer Patients.,"Radiation is foundational to the treatment of cancer and improves overall survival. Yet, it is important to recognize the potential cardiovascular effects of radiation therapy and how to best minimize or manage them. Screening-both through imaging and with biomarkers-can potentially identify cardiovascular effects early, allowing for prompt initiation of treatment to mitigate late effects.Cardiac echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography, and measurements of troponin and natriuretic peptides serve as the initial screening tests of choice for RICD. Novel imaging applications, including positron emission tomography and specific MRI parameters, and biomarker testing, including myeloperoxidase, growth differentiation factor 15, galectin 3, micro-RNA, and metabolomics, hold promise for earlier detection and more specific characterization of RICD. Advances in imaging and novel applications of biomarkers have potential to identify subclinical RICD and may reveal opportunities for early intervention.

Population pharmacokinetic models consisted of stepwise procedures to accommodate data availability and the model's application to answering clinical development questions. At each iteration of the model update, parameters of the next model were re-estimated by leveraging previous information and new data.Three model development lifecycle iterations of the ritlecitinib population pharmacokinetic model were conducted to support alopecia areata, vitiligo, and ulcerative colitis study readouts. Initial structural modeling based on healthy participant data (and some rheumatoid arthritis and alopecia areata data) in iteration 1 provided a platform for comprehensive covariate testing during iteration 2, and model evaluation and implementation of the frequentist prior approach in iteration 3. The final model was a two-compartment model with first-order absorption and direct-response non-stationary clearance and bioavailability driven by concentrations in the peripheral compartment.The present approach demonstrated the evolution of three population pharmacokinetic models with accumulating data, addressed clinical drug development questions related to systemic exposures of ritlecitinib, and informed the approved product label.NCT02309827, NCT02684760, NCT02958865, NCT02969044, NCT03232905, NCT03732807, NCT04016077, NCT03715829, NCT04037865, NCT04004663, NCT04634565, NCT02974868.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",2

We sought to determine the regional differences in clinical characteristics and prevalence of CMD in HFpEF.We analysed clinical characteristics and CMD in 202 patients with stable HFpEF (left ventricular ejection fraction ≥40%) in Finland, Singapore, Sweden, and United States in the multicentre PROMIS-HFpEF study. Patients with unrevascularized macrovascular coronary artery disease were excluded. CMD was assessed using Doppler echocardiography and defined as coronary flow reserve (adenosine-induced vs. resting flow) < 2.5. Patients from Singapore had the lowest body mass index yet highest prevalence of hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and diabetes; patients from Finland and Sweden were oldest, with the most atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, and high smoking rates; and those from United States were youngest and most obese. The prevalence of CMD was 88% in Finland, 80% in Singapore, 77% in Sweden, and 59% in the United States; however, non-significant after adjustment for age, sex, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, smoking, left atrial reservoir strain, and atrial fibrillation. Associations between CMD and clinical characteristics did not differ based on region (interaction analysis).Despite regional differences in clinical characteristics, CMD was present in the majority of patients with HFpEF across different regions of the world with the lowest prevalence in the United States.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as non-invasive biomarkers of IBD; however, the full disease-specific miRNAs signature for IBD subtypes remains elusive. We evaluated the diagnostic role of circulating miR-486 and miR-25 in IBD patients and their potential ability to discriminate IBD subtypes; ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Sixty UC patients, 60 CD patients, and 60 healthy controls were recruited. Serum miRNA expression was determined using RT-qPCR. Bioinformatics was employed for target gene and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses. Serum miR-486 was upregulated in CD patients, but didn't change in UC patients compared to controls. Conversely, serum miR-25 was decreased in both CD and UC patients compared to controls. Only miR-486 was differentially expressed between UC and CD patients. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis revealed that serum miR-486 was superior in CD diagnosis (AUC=0.945) and significantly distinguished CD and UC patients, whereas miR-25 showed discriminative potential for both UC and CD from controls. In the multivariate logistic analysis only miR-486 was associated with the risk of CD diagnosis. Serum miR-486 was correlated with CD activity index and location of disease in CD patients, whereas miR-25 was correlated with the type/extent of UC. PPI network analysis revealed common target genes and signaling pathways for both miRNAs. Conclusively, serum miR-486 and miR-25 might serve as new biomarkers of IBD, with serum miR-486 could be employed in risk stratification of IBD subtypes and has the ground for clinical utility in CD diagnosis, whereas miR-25 has potential for UC and CD diagnosis.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",2

The serum profile of inflammatory biomarkers and noncoding RNA and their role in the propagation of the inflammatory process remains controversial. Thus, this study was designed to examine the relationship between hematological profile, C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interferon-gamma (INF-γ), and the expression of LINC00641 and miR-378a in individuals with IBDs. In addition, we elucidated the correlation between the expression of LINC00641 and miR-378a and the biochemical variables analyzed. This retrospective study analyzed 94 unrelated participants. Group I included healthy controls, Group II consisted of participants diagnosed with UC, and Group III consisted of participants diagnosed with CD. Patients with IBDs experienced significant elevations in CRP, total leukocyte count, platelets, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, TNF-α, and INF-γ. However, participants with IBD had lower hemoglobin and albumin levels than healthy control participants. Moreover, the expression levels of LINC00641 and miR-378a were elevated in participants with IBD, with a significant difference between participants with IBD and healthy controls. The most striking observation was a clear association between serum LINC00641 and miR-378a levels and the biochemical variables assessed. This study demonstrated a positive correlation between the expression of LINC00641/miR-378a and TNF-α in patients with UC and CD patients.

2023-11-29,38009731,Obtaining High-Quality Cryosections of Whole Rabbit Eye.,"This protocol describes how to obtain high-quality retinal cryosections in larger animals, such as rabbits. After enucleation, the eye is briefly immersed in the fixative. Then, the cornea and iris are removed and the eye is left overnight for additional fixation at 4 °C. Following fixation, the lens is removed. The eye is then placed in a cryomold and filled with an embedding medium. By removing the lens, the embedding medium has better access to the vitreous and leads to better retinal stability. Importantly, the eye should be incubated in embedding medium overnight to allow complete infiltration throughout the vitreous. Following overnight incubation, the eye is frozen on dry ice and sectioned. Whole retinal sections may be obtained for use in immunohistochemistry. Standard staining protocols may be utilized to study the localization of antigens within the retinal tissue.

Vascular parameters included parafoveal vessel density (VD), vessel length density (VLD), and flow index (FI) of the superficial capillary plexus (SCP) and deep capillary plexus (DCP) as well as foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area and perimeter. Multivariable linear regression was used for statistical analysis.There were 1809 patients with diabetes and 217 non-diabetic participants that were included in this study. Diabetic individuals included those with no DR (n = 1356), mild non-proliferative DR (NPDR; n = 286), moderate NPDR (n = 126), and severe NPDR/proliferative DR (PDR; n = 41). Male sex was significantly associated with smaller FAZ area/perimeter and lower DCP VLD in both non-diabetic subjects and patients with diabetes. Male sex in the diabetic group was additionally associated with lower SCP VD/VLD and DCP VD. Addition of an interaction between male sex and diabetes status in the interaction analysis showed that being male and diabetic conferred increased reduction in DCP VD and VLD compared to sex-based changes in non-diabetics. Larger FAZ perimeter, lower SCP VD/VLD, and lower DCP VLD were associated with poorer visual acuity in diabetics.On OCTA, male patients with diabetes may have more severe microvascular disease especially in the DCP compared to women.Sex-based alterations in diabetic microvascular disease has the potential to influence future basic and clinical studies as well as the implementation of OCTA disease markers.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinopathy,2

The principal objective of this meticulous investigation was to rigorously evaluate the causal nexus between IBD and BC, employing the robust methodology of Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.We meticulously performed both univariate and multivariate Mendelian randomization (MVMR) analyses employing publicly accessible genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. The central approach employed for our investigations was inverse variance weighting (IVW) method, while diligently scrutinizing potential sources of heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy via the rigorous utilization of Cochran's Q test, the MR-PRESSO method, and MR-Egger.In the univariate MR analysis, no causal link was observed between genetic prediction of IBD and BC. Furthermore, both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) showed no causal association with BC. The consistent association between CD and UC in the MVMR analysis supports this finding.This study found no genetic basis for the causative association of IBD and BC. It is crucial to emphasize that further comprehensive investigations are warranted to delve into the intricate underlying mechanisms that may contribute to these associations.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,"ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease",2

Seven hundred ninety consecutive patients hospitalized with HFpEF from 2006 to 2017 were enrolled. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared between low NT-proBNP group (<300 ng/L) and elevated NT-proBNP group (≥300 ng/L). 108 HFpEF patients (13.7%) presented with low NT-proBNP levels. Age, body mass index, atrial fibrillation, New York Heart Association functional class, and albumin were independent predictors of low NT-proBNP levels in HFpEF patients. During the median follow-up duration of 1103 days, 11 patients (10.2%) in low NT-proBNP group suffered from primary endpoint event. Elevated NT-proBNP group had a higher risk of all-cause death or heart transplantation than low NT-proBNP group (adjusted HR [95%CI]: 2.36 [1.24,4.49], P = .009). Stratified analyses showed that the association between NT-proBNP (elevated NT-proBNP group vs low NT-proBNP group) and risk of all-cause death or heart transplantation was stronger in non-atrial fibrillation patients than in atrial fibrillation patients (P value for interaction = .025). Furthermore, the associations between NT-proBNP and risk of all-cause death or heart transplantation were stronger in younger and male patients than in older and female patients. However, both subgroups only reached borderline significant (P values for interaction = .062 and .084, respectively). Our findings suggest that low NT-proBNP levels were common in patients hospitalized with HFpEF. Patients with HFpEF and low NT-proBNP levels had a better prognosis than those with elevated NT-proBNP levels, particularly in younger, male, and non-atrial fibrillation patients.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,natriuretic,,2

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of fatigue and its associated factors in a cohort of patients newly diagnosed with IBD.Patients ≥18 years old were recruited from the Inflammatory Bowel Disease South-Eastern Norway [IBSEN III] study, a population-based, observational inception cohort. Fatigue was assessed using the Fatigue Questionnaire and compared with data from a Norwegian general population. Univariate and multivariate linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the associations of total fatigue [TF; continuous score] and substantial fatigue [SF; dichotomized score ≥4] with sociodemographic, clinical, endoscopic, laboratory, and other relevant patient data.In total, 983/1509 [65.1%] patients with complete fatigue data were included (ulcerative colitis [UC], 68.2%; Crohn's disease [CD], 31.8%). The prevalence of SF was higher in CD [69.6%] compared with UC [60.2%] [p < 0.01], and in both diagnoses when compared to the general population [p < 0.001]. In multivariate analyses, depressive symptoms, pain intensity, and sleep disturbances were associated with increased TF for both diagnoses. In addition, increased clinical disease activity and Mayo endoscopic score were significantly associated with TF in UC, whereas all disease-related variables were insignificant in CD. Similar findings were observed for SF, except regarding the Mayo endoscopic score.SF affects approximately two-thirds of patients newly diagnosed with IBD.

Data on target organ damage such as retinopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), renal impairment and peripheral neuropathy (PN) among persons with elevated BP and/or DM in sub-Saharan Africa remain scarce.To determine at community-level the prevalence of retinopathy, LVH, renal impairment, and PN among adults with elevated BP and/or DM, and assess the association of elevated BP and/or DM with target organ damage in Lesotho.During a household-based survey, a sub-sample of adults with elevated BP (≥ 140/90 mmHg) and/or DM (glycosylated hemoglobin ≥ 6.5%), as well as comparators (BP < 140/90 mmHg, HbA1c < 6.5%) were screened for retinopathy, LVH, renal impairment, and PN. We used multivariable logistic regression for inferential analysis.Out of 6108 participants screened during the survey, 420 with elevated BP only, 80 with DM only, 61 with elevated BP and DM, and 360 comparators were assessed for target organ damage. Among those with elevated BP, and among those with DM with or without elevated BP, prevalence of retinopathy was 34.6% (89/257) and 14.4% (15/104); renal impairment was 45.0% (156/347) and 42.4% (56/132), respectively. Among those with elevated BP, 2.3% (7/300) and 65.7% (224/341) had LVH and left ventricular concentric remodeling, respectively. PN, only assessed among those with DM, was present in 32.6% (42/129). Elevated BP was associated with increased odds of retinopathy (aOR, 19.13; 95% CI, 8.52-42.94; P < 0.001) and renal impairment (aOR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.27-2.55; P = 0.001).

2023-11-30,37899750,"A biologically validated mathematical model for decoding epithelial apical, basolateral, and paracellular electrical properties.","Epithelial tissues form selective barriers to ions, nutrients, waste products, and infectious agents throughout the body. Damage to these barriers is associated with conditions such as celiac disease, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, and age-related macular degeneration. Conventional electrophysiology measurements like transepithelial resistance can quantify epithelial tissue maturity and barrier integrity but are limited in differentiating between apical, basolateral, and paracellular transport pathways. To overcome this limitation, a combination of mathematical modeling, stem cell biology, and cell physiology led to the development of 3 P-EIS, a novel mathematical model and measurement technique. 3 P-EIS employs an intracellular pipette and extracellular electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to accurately measure membrane-specific properties of epithelia, without the constraints of prior models. 3 P-EIS was validated using electronic circuit models of epithelia with known resistances and capacitances, confirming a median error of 19% (interquartile range: 14%-26%) for paracellular and transcellular resistances and capacitances (n = 5). Patient stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelium tissues were measured using 3 P-EIS, successfully isolating the cellular responses to adenosine triphosphate. 3 P-EIS enhances quality control in epithelial cell therapies and has extensive applicability in drug testing and disease modeling, marking a significant advance in epithelial physiology.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This interdisciplinary paper integrates mathematics, biology, and physiology to measure epithelial tissue's apical, basolateral, and paracellular transport pathways. A key advancement is the inclusion of intracellular voltage recordings using a sharp pipette, enabling precise quantification of relative impedance changes between apical and basolateral membranes. This enhanced electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technique offers insights into epithelial transport dynamics, advancing disease understanding, drug interactions, and cell therapies.

Our aim was to examine causal and predictive relationships between 4137 serum proteins and incident AF in the prospective population-based Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik (AGES-Reykjavik) study.The study included 4765 participants, of whom 1172 developed AF. Cox proportional hazards regression models were fitted for 4137 baseline protein measurements adjusting for known risk factors. Protein associations were tested for replication in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS). Causal relationships were examined in a bidirectional, two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis. The time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)-statistic was examined as protein levels and an AF-polygenic risk score (PRS) were added to clinical risk models. The proteomic signature of incident AF consisted of 76 proteins, of which 63 (83%) were novel and 29 (38%) were replicated in CHS. The signature included both N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)-dependent (e.g. CHST15, ATP1B1, and SVEP1) and independent components (e.g. ASPN, AKR1B, and LAMA1/LAMB1/LAMC1). Nine causal candidates were identified (TAGLN, WARS, CHST15, CHMP3, COL15A1, DUSP13, MANBA, QSOX2, and SRL). The reverse causal analysis suggested that most AF-associated proteins were affected by the genetic liability to AF. N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide improved the prediction of incident AF events close to baseline with further improvements gained by the AF-PRS at all time points.The AF proteomic signature includes biologically relevant proteins, some of which may be causal. It mainly reflects an NT-proBNP-dependent consequence of the genetic liability to AF. N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide is a promising marker for incident AF in the short term, but risk assessment incorporating a PRS may improve long-term risk assessment.",yes,no,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,natriuretic,,2
2023-11-30,37982769,Pro-Fibrotic Role of Interleukin-4 in Influencing Idiopathic Epiretinal Membrane in Cataract Patients: Analysis From Clinical-Experimental Approaches.,"To evaluate the role of interleukin-4 in influencing idiopathic epiretinal membrane (iERM) formation and early progression post cataract surgery (PCS) from clinical and experimental perspectives.We quantified levels of IL-4 in aqueous humor (AH) samples from 22 iERM patients and 31 control subjects collected before and 20 hours after cataract surgeries using ELISA. After a 3-month follow-up, the association between IL-4 levels and iERM progression measurements was identified. In addition, in vitro studies were conducted to investigate the effects of IL-4 on primary rat retinal Müller glia proliferation, migration, and glial-mesenchymal transition (GMT).Concentrations of IL-4 were significantly higher in preoperative AH samples from iERM patients versus controls (P = 0.006). Postoperatively, although IL-4 levels were elevated in both groups compared to their respective preoperative levels, they were even more obviously so in the iERM group (P < 0.001). Multivariate linear regression analyses revealed that, postoperatively, IL-4 level elevation was positively associated with macular volume and thickness increase (both P < 0.05) in iERM patients. However, no correlations were observed between IL-4 level (changes) and clinical characters in the controls. In vitro studies demonstrated that IL-4 promoted Müller glia proliferation and migration and increased the expression of GMT-related markers in a manner independent of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1).IL-4 plays a crucial pro-fibrotic role in iERM formation and early progression 3 months PCS possibly by stimulating Müller glia proliferation, migration, and GMT in a TGF-β1-independent manner.The current study suggests the potential of IL-4 as a novel therapeutic target for iERM.",no,yes,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,retinal disease,2

It is defined as an abnormal and permanent increase in choroidal thickness ≥ 300 μm, which is caused by dilatation of the choroidal vessels of the Haller's layer, thinning of the Sattler's layer and the choriocapillaris layer.Literary research focused on the current view of pachychoroid spectrum diseases, including clarification of the pathophysiological theories of the formation of ""pachychoroid"".It is assumed that ""pachychoroid"" disease has an autosomal dominant type of heredity. Depending on the further activity of various exogenous and/or endogenous factors, pachychoroid diseases may appear. According to the current knowledge, the spectrum of pachychoroid disease covers six clinical entities: pachychoroid pigment epitheliopathy, central serous chorioretinopathy, pachychoroid neovasculopathy, polypoid choroidal vasculopathy, focal choroidal excavation and peripapillary pachychoroid syndrome. In this study, we describe the clinical symptoms and objective findings of focal choroidal excavation and peripapillary pachychoroid syndrome. The current pathophysiological theory of pachychoroid diseases is based on impaired venous outflow from the choroid (""venous overload choroidopathy"") and thickening of the sclera in the eyes of affected patients.Pachychoroid diseases should be included in the differential diagnosis of characteristic features observed during multimodal imaging analysis of choroidal changes.",no,yes,no,other,,,retinal disease,2

2023-11-30,38019435,Peptide-Mediated Cyclic Nucleotide Signaling in Plants: Identification and Characterization of Interactor Proteins with Nucleotide Cyclase Activity.,"During the last decades, an increasing number of plant signaling peptides have been discovered and it appears that many of them are specific ligands for interacting receptor molecules. These receptors can enable the formation of second messengers which in turn transmit the ligand-induced stimuli into complex and tunable downstream responses. In order to perform such complex tasks, receptor proteins often contain several distinct domains such as a kinase and/or adenylate cyclase (AC) or guanylate cyclase (GC) domains. ACs catalyze the conversion of ATP to 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) while GCs catalyze the reaction of GTP to 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Both cAMP and cGMP are now recognized as essential components of many plant responses, including responses to peptidic hormones. Here we describe the approach that led to the discovery of the Plant Natriuretic Peptide Receptor (PNP receptor), including a protocol for the identification of currently undiscovered peptidic interactions, and the subsequent application of computational methods for the identification of AC and/or GC domains in such interacting receptor candidates.",yes,no,no,in vitro,biomarker,natriuretic,,2

DR was graded according to the International Classification of Diabetic Retinopathy. Inferior whorl length (IWL), spiral orientation, central nerve fiber length (CNFL), retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, ganglion cell complex (GCC) layer thickness, global loss volume (GLV), focal loss volume (FLV) indices, superficial (sVD), and deep vessel densities (dVD) were examined.Compared with those of healthy controls, the IWL, CNFL, and FLV were decreased in the diabetic groups (P < 0.001). The IWL was significantly positively correlated with the RNFL and GCC thicknesses in the diabetic group (r = 0.248, P = 0.006 and r = 0.207, P = 0.023, respectively) and significantly negatively correlated with the FLV (r = -0.535, P < 0.001). The sVD was significantly positively correlated with the RNFL thickness (r = 0.314, P < 0.001) and negatively correlated with the GLV (r = -0.229, P = 0.012).Our findings suggest a correlation between corneal whorl-like nerve plexus and retinal nerve changes in the early stages of DR and that the IWL of the cornea may be able to indicate the extent of DR.

Right-sided cardiac damage (rCD) was defined as pulmonary vasculature/tricuspid/right ventricular damage. Hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) and/or death served as primary endpoint. In total, 880 patients (81 ± 7 years, 47% female) undergoing TAVI were included and 360 (41%) had FO. Clinical examination in patients with FO was unremarkable for congestion signs in >50%. A quarter had FO but no rCD (FO+/rCD-). FO+/rCD+ had the highest damage markers, including N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels. After 2.4 ± 1.0 years of follow-up, 236 patients (27%) had reached the primary endpoint (29 HHF, 194 deaths, 13 both). Quantitatively, every 1.0 L increase in bioimpedance was associated with a 13% increase in event hazard (adjusted hazard ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 1.06-1.22, p < 0.001). FO provided incremental prognostic value to traditional risk markers (NT-proBNP, EuroSCORE II, damage on echocardiography). Stratification according to FO and rCD yielded worse outcomes for FO+/rCD+ and FO+/rCD-, but not FO-/rCD+, compared to FO-/rCD-.Quantitative FO in patients with severe AS improves risk prediction of worse post-interventional outcomes compared to traditional risk assessment.",no,no,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,,0

2023-11-01,37807083,Altered biomarkers for cardiovascular disease and inflammation in autoimmune Addison's disease - a cross-sectional study.,"Increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease has been reported in autoimmune Addison's disease (AAD), but pathomechanisms are poorly understood.Cross-sectional study.We compared serum levels of 177 cardiovascular and inflammatory biomarkers in 43 patients with AAD at >18-h glucocorticoid withdrawal and 43 matched controls, overall and stratified for sex. Biomarker levels were correlated with the frequency of adrenal crises and quality of life (QoL) by AddiQoL-30. Finally, we investigated changes in biomarker levels following 250 µg tetracosactide injection in patients without residual adrenocortical function (RAF) to explore glucocorticoid-independent effects of high ACTH.Nineteen biomarkers significantly differed between patients with AAD and controls; all but 1 (ST1A1) were higher in AAD. Eight biomarkers were significantly higher in female patients compared with controls (IL6, MCP1, GAL9, SPON2, DR4, RAGE, TNFRSF9, and PGF), but none differed between male patients and controls. Levels of RAGE correlated with the frequency of adrenal crises (r = 0.415, P = .006) and AddiQoL-30 scores (r = -0.347, P = .028) but not after correction for multiple testing. PDL2 and leptin significantly declined 60 min after injection of ACTH in AAD without RAF (-0.15 normalized protein expression [NPX], P = .0001, and -0.25 NPX, P = .0003, respectively).We show that cardiovascular and inflammatory biomarkers are altered in AAD compared with controls, particularly in women. RAGE might be a marker of disease severity in AAD, associated with more adrenal crises and reduced QoL. High ACTH reduced PDL2 and leptin levels in a glucocorticoid-independent manner but the overall effect on biomarker profiles was small.",no,no,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,,0
2023-11-01,37809072,Research progress on the clinical application and mechanism of iguratimod in the treatment of autoimmune diseases and rheumatic diseases.,"Autoimmune diseases are affected by complex pathophysiology involving multiple cell types, cytokines, antibodies and mimicking factors. Different drugs are used to improve these autoimmune responses, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, antibodies, and small molecule drugs (DMARDs), which are prevalent clinically in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), etc. However, low cost-effectiveness, reduced efficacy, adverse effects, and patient non-response are unattractive factors driving the development of new drugs such as iguratimod. As a new disease-modifying antirheumatic drug, iguratimod has pharmacological activities such as regulating autoimmune disorders, inflammatory cytokines, regulating immune cell activation, differentiation and proliferation, improving bone metabolism, and inhibiting fibrosis. In recent years, clinical studies have found that iguratimod is effective in the treatment of RA, SLE, IGG4-RD, Sjogren 's syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis, interstitial lung disease, and other autoimmune diseases and rheumatic diseases. The amount of basic and clinical research on other autoimmune diseases is also increasing. Therefore, this review systematically reviews the latest relevant literature in recent years, reviews the research results in recent years, and summarizes the research progress of iguratimod in the treatment of related diseases. This review highlights the role of iguratimod in the protection of autoimmune and rheumatic bone and related immune diseases. It is believed that iguratimod's unique mode of action and its favorable patient response compared to other DMARDs make it a suitable antirheumatic and bone protective agent in the future.",no,no,yes,other,"effectiveness, safety",,,0

Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) decreased at PODs 1 and 3. Testosterone decreased at PODs 1 and 3 in men, and at POD 3 in women. Sex hormone-binding globulin decreased at PODs 1 and 3 in both genders. No changes were observed in free testosterone or growth hormone concentrations. Insulin-like growth factor 1 increased significantly above the preoperative level at PODs 42 and 90 in women, and at POD 42 in men. IL-6 was significantly elevated at PODs 1 and 3. Increases in IL-6 from the preoperative level to POD 1 correlated significantly with decreases of cortisol at POD 1 but not with ACTH.There were only short-term stress hormonal changes after elective lumbar spine fusion surgery. Cortisol changes after elective lumbar spine surgery are transient and might be partly cytokine induced and non-ACTH driven since there was association between cortisol and IL-6 but not with ACTH and IL-6.",no,no,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,,0

The patients were divided into group A (anticoagulant treatment group, n = 112) and group B (selective anticoagulant treatment group, n = 52) according to the CHA2DS2-VASc score, which scored for the presence or absence of congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes mellitus, stroke/transient ischaemic attack, vascular disease, age 65-74 years and gender (female). The CHA2DS2-VASc score was used to predict risk of thromboembolism from atrial fibrillation. The correlations of CHA2DS2-VASc score with CTA-based LAA classification and RT-3D-TEE measurement parameters were explored using Spearman's analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to explore the predictive value of CTA and RT-3D-TEE for LAA thrombus.There were significant differences in age, disease course, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke/transient ischaemic attack/thromboembolism, vascular disease, B-type natriuretic peptide and serum uric acid levels, CHA2DS2-VASc score, LAA classification, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left atrial diameter (LAD), maximum diameter of LAA orifice, minimum diameter of LAA orifice and LAA length (p < 0.05). CHA2DS2- VASc score was positively correlated with cauliflower LAA, LAD, maximum diameter of LAA orifice, minimum diameter of LAA orifice and LAA length, and negatively correlated with LVEF (p < 0.001). ROC curve analysis indicated that CTA, RT-3D-TEE and CHA2DS2-VASc score had similar predictive values for risk of LAA thrombosis in atrial fibrillation patients, with the areas under the curve being 0.778, 0.814 and 0.792, respectively.Both CTA and RT-3D-TEE had high predictive values for LAA thrombosis in atrial fibrillation patients.",no,no,no,human non-RCT,diagnostic,,,0

Postoperative assessment by clinical examination and 3D EAUS was performed at 2 weeks, 3 months and 6-12 months (""late control""). Long-term follow-up was carried out in 2017. The 3D EAUS examinations were blinded and analysed by two observers using a protocol with defined relevant findings for different follow-up time points.A total of 95 patients with a total of 151 AFP procedures were included. Long-term follow-up was completed in 90 (95%) patients. Inflammation at 3 months, gas in fistula and visible fistula at 3 months and at late control, were statistically significant 3D EAUS findings for AFP failure. The combination of gas in fistula and clinical finding of fluid discharge through the external fistula opening 3 months postoperatively was statistically significant (p < 0.001) for AFP failure with 91% sensitivity and 79% specificity. The positive predictive value was 91%, while the negative predictive value was 79%.3D EAUS may be utilized for the follow-up of AFP treatment.

2023-11-02,37301520,New developments in the management of persistent corneal epithelial defects.,"A persistent epithelial defect (PED) is a corneal epithelial defect that failed to heal after 2weeks. It is a condition that carries much morbidity, and our understanding of PED remains poor, with current treatment methods often having unsatisfactory outcomes. With PEDs becoming more prevalent, more efforts are required to establish reliable treatment modalities. Our reviews describe the causes of PEDs and the different approaches developed to manage them, as well as their associated limitations. Emphasis is placed on understanding various advances in the development of new treatment modalities. We have also described a case of a woman with a background of graft-versus-host disease on long-term topical corticosteroids who developed complicated PED involving both eyes. The current approach to managing PEDs generally involves exclusion of an active infection, followed by treatment modalities that aim to encourage corneal epithelial healing. Success rates, however, remain far from desirable, as treatment remains challenging due to multiple underlying etiologies. In summary, advances in the development of new therapies may be able to facilitate progress in the understanding and treatment of PED.",no,no,no,other,,,,0

SD-OCT study.,"Previous studies have generally focused on dry eye test abnormalities and ocular involvements such as uveitis, and blepharitis in psoriasis. Psoriasis area severity ındex (PASI), which is used to assess psoriasis severity, is a time-consuming and complex tool.To evaluate the relationship between disease severity and central corneal epithelial thickness (CCET) in psoriasis.175 eyes of 175 psoriasis patients and 57 eyes of 57 healthy individuals as a control group was included in this study. Psoriasis patients were divided into three subgroups according to PASI score as < 10 mild, 10‒20 moderate and > 20 severe. CCET was measured by spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), and mean values were recorded. Mean CCET values were compared between the psoriasis groups and the control group. Additionally, the relationship between PASI score and CCET was examined.The mean CCET value was 58.06±3.1μm in the mild group, 60.10±5.0μm in the moderate group, 65.75±6.3μm in the severe group and 56.16±3.1μm in the control group. It was determined that the mean CCET value was significantly higher in all psoriasis groups compared to the control group (p<0.001). The mean CCET value was significantly higher in the moderate psoriasis group than in the mild psoriasis group (p=0.018), and in the severe psoriasis group compared to the moderate psoriasis group (p<0.001). There was a strong positive correlation between PASI score and CCET (p<0.001, r=0.519).Cross-sectional design and a relatively small number of participants.There is a strong positive correlation between psoriasis severity and CCET.

There will be no response seen in corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and baseline AVP will be within reference interval.Twelve neonatal foals, <72 hours old.HPAA function was assessed in foals utilizing 3 doses of AVP (2.5, 5, and 7.5 IU), administered between 24 and 48 hours of age in this randomized cross-over study. Cortisol, ACTH, CRH and AVP were measured at 0 (baseline), 15, 30, 60 and 90 minutes after AVP administration with immunoassays. The fold increase in cortisol and ACTH was calculated at 15 and 30 minutes compared to baseline.All doses of AVP resulted in a significant increase in cortisol concentration over time, and a dose-dependent increase in ACTH concentration over time. ACTH and cortisol were significantly increased at 15 and 30 minutes, respectively after all 3 doses of AVP compared to baseline (P < .01). There was no change in endogenous CRH after stimulation with AVP.Administration of AVP is safe and results in a significant rise in ACTH and cortisol in neonatal foals.

2023-11-02,37470523,Effect of preoperative ivabradine on hemodynamics during elective off-pump CABG.,"Ivabradine is a specific heart rate (HR)-lowering agent which blocks the cardiac pacemaker If channels. It reduces the HR without causing a negative inotropic or lusitropic effect, thus preserving ventricular contractility. The authors hypothesized that its usefulness in lowering HR can be utilized in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) surgery.To study the effects of preoperative ivabradine on hemodynamics (during surgery) in patients undergoing elective OPCAB surgery.Fifty patients, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I and II, were randomized into group I (control, n = 25) and group II (ivabradine group, n = 25). In group I, patients received the usual anti-anginal medications in the preoperative period, as per the institutional protocol. In group II, patients received ivabradine 5 mg twice daily for 3 days before surgery, in addition to the usual anti-anginal medications. Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl, thiopentone sodium, and pancuronium bromide as a muscle relaxant and maintained with fentanyl, midazolam, pancuronium bromide, and isoflurane. The hemodynamic parameters [HR and mean arterial pressure (MAP)] and pulmonary artery (PA) catheter-derived data were recorded at the baseline (before induction), 3 min after the induction of anesthesia at 1 min and 3 min after intubation and at 5 min and 30 min after protamine administration. Intraoperatively, hemodynamic data (HR and MAP) were recorded every 10 min, except during distal anastomosis of the coronary arteries when it was recorded every 5 min. Post-operatively, at 24 hours, the levels of troponin T and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) were measured. This trial's CTRI registration number is CTRI/005858.The HR in group II was lower when compared to group I (range 59.6-72.4 beats/min and 65.8-80.2 beats/min, respectively) throughout the study period. MAP was comparable [range (78.5-87.8 mm Hg) vs. (78.9-88.5 mm Hg) in group II vs. group I, respectively] throughout the study period. Intraoperatively, 5 patients received metoprolol in group I to control the HR, whereas none of the patients in group II required metoprolol. The incidence of preoperative bradycardia (HR <60 beats/min) was higher in group II (20%) vs. group I (8%). There was no difference in both the groups in terms of troponin T and BNP level after 24 hours, time to extubation, requirement of inotropes, incidence of arrhythmias, in-hospital morbidity, and 30-day mortality.Ivabradine can be safely used along with other anti-anginal agents during the preoperative period in patients undergoing OPCAB surgery. It helps to maintain a lower HR during surgery and reduces the need for beta-blockers in the intraoperative period, a desirable and beneficial effect in situations where the use of beta-blockers may be potentially harmful. Further studies are needed to evaluate the beneficial effects of perioperative Ivabradine in patients with moderate-to-severe left ventricular dysfunction.",no,no,no,human RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,,0
2023-11-02,37527008,Heart failure in a cat due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy phenotype caused by chronic uncontrolled hyperthyroidism.,"A 16-year-old castrated male Persian cat was presented with weight loss, anorexia and dyspnoea. Tachycardia and tachypnoea were observed upon presentation. The cat was previously diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and left ventricular hypertrophy and received methimazole, but was subsequently not followed up and treated appropriately. Thoracic radiography revealed mild pleural effusion, interstitial lung pattern, moderate cardiomegaly and moderate-to-severe dilation of the pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein. On echocardiography, the left ventricular hypertrophy, identified earlier, shoed partial regression. Therefore, the previous myocardial hypertrophy was diagnosed as a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy phenotype related to hyperthyroidism. ST-segment elevation was identified on electrocardiography, and the thyroid profile examination revealed increased total thyroxine and free thyroxine and decreased thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, suggesting myocardial injury and uncontrolled hyperthyroidism, respectively. In addition, normal N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and high cardiac troponin I levels were found. Based on these findings, the observed congestive heart failure was considered as a sequel of myocardial injury caused by uncontrolled hyperthyroidism. Clinical signs resolved after intravenous administration of furosemide and butorphanol, oxygen supply and thoracocentesis. Furosemide and pimobendan were additionally administered, and the cat was discharged. This case demonstrates that myocardial damage due to chronic uncontrolled hyperthyroidism may cause heart failure in cats.",no,no,no,animal,safety,,,0

2023-11-02,37608634,Exploring the current use of animal models in glaucoma drug discovery: where are we in 2023?,"Animal models are widely used in glaucoma-related research. Since the elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor underlying the disease pathogenesis, animal models with high IOP are commonly used. However, models are also used to represent the clinical context of glaucomatous changes developing despite a normal IOP.Herein, the authors discuss the various factors that contribute to the quality of studies using animal models based on the evaluation of studies published in 2022. The factors affecting the quality of studies using animal models, such as the animal species, age, and sex, are discussed, along with various methods and outcomes of studies involving different animal models of glaucoma.Translating animal research data to clinical applications remains challenging. Our observations in this review clearly indicate that many studies lack scientific robustness not only in their experiment conduct but also in data analysis, interpretation, and presentation.

2023-11-02,37638999,Current evidence on diagnosis and treatment of parotid gland lymphomas: a systematic review.,"Parotid gland lymphoma (PGL) is a rare and challenging diagnosis. Different lymphomas can develop in the parotid gland, with the most common being the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, which originates directly from the glandular parenchyma. Other histologic subtypes arise from both intraglandular and extraglandular parotid lymph nodes. A consensus on diagnosis and treatment of PGL is still lacking, and published data is scarce and heterogeneous.We performed a systematic review of the literature, including studies published after 2001, when the WHO classification of lymphoid tumours was introduced.Twenty retrospective studies were included in the analyses, eight of which focused exclusively on MALT lymphomas. Final analysis included 612 cases of PGL, with a 1.68:1 F/M ratio. MALT lymphoma was the most common histology, followed by follicular and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Most cases were low stages (IE/IIE acc. Ann Arbour, 76.5%) and only 10% of patients presented with symptoms, most commonly pain (4.8%) and B symptoms (2.2%). A high prevalence of associated autoimmune diseases was found, particularly Sjögren's syndrome, that affected up to 70% of patients with MALT lymphoma. In most cases diagnosis was achieved through parotidectomy (57.5%), or open biopsy (31.2%). Treatment strategies were either surgical, non-surgical or a combination of modalities. Surgery as a single-modality treatment was reported in about 20% of patients, supposing it might be a valuable option for selected patients.Our review showed that the diagnosis and treatment of PGLs is far from being standardized and needs further, more homogeneous reports to reach consensus.",no,no,yes,other,"diagnostic, effectiveness",,,0
2023-11-02,37781889,Cost-effectiveness of NT-proBNP-supported screening of chronic heart failure in patients with or without type 2 diabetes in Austria and Switzerland.,"Heart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome with a global burden. Signs and symptoms of HF are nonspecific and often shared with other conditions. The N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) serves as a useful biomarker for the diagnosis of HF not only in patients with acute symptoms but also in outpatients with an ambiguous clinical presentation. The aim of the analysis is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of implementing NT-proBNP in the diagnostic algorithm in patients with/without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), compared with a diagnosis based primarily on clinical signs or symptoms from the perspective of the Austrian and Swiss healthcare system.A time-discrete Markov model was developed to simulate the effect/improvement (lifetime-costs, quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs], and life-years [LYs]) due to an NT-proBNP screening in undetected HF patients. Undetected HF patients are included in the model according to a distribution of New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes. The model considers disease progression by transition of NYHA classes. Undetected patients may remain undetected or be detected with the help of NT-proBNP or symptoms. Patients with known HF exhibit a slower disease progression. The probability of dying is influenced by the respective NYHA class. Direct costs (2021 € or CHF) were derived from published sources. QALYs, LYs, and costs were discounted (3% p.a.).In the per-patient analysis (at age 60 over lifetime), the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR)/QALY of NT-proBNP vs. no screening was €3,042 for HF patients in Austria. Considering the total cohort of undetected HF patients (n = 9,377) with the corresponding age structure over a lifetime, the ICUR increases to €4,356. In Switzerland, the per-patient results show an ICUR of CHF 897. Considering the total cohort of undetected HF patients (n = 6,826) the ICUR amounts to CHF 4,513. If indirect costs are considered, NT-proBNP screening becomes the dominant strategy in both countries.Overall, the analysis concludes that screening with NT-proBNP is a highly cost-effective or cost-saving diagnostic option for patients with HF, and a sensitivity analysis confirmed these findings.",no,no,no,other,"effectiveness, biomarker",,,0

The worse ADL (activities of daily living) grading, indication of primary intraocular lymphoma or intraocular tumour, surgery of simple pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), PPV with silicone oil tamponade, PPV with gas tamponade, general anaesthesia, history of diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic heart failure and digestive system disease were the risk factors positively correlated with postoperative systemic complications (p < .05). The worse ADL grading, history of DM and respiratory system disease were also positively correlated with the severity of the adverse events (p < .05).The incidence of postoperative systemic complications was low among patients undergoing ophthalmic surgery, most were mild and could be relieved after observation, symptomatic or specialist consultation.

2023-11-02,37816574,Isolated ACTH deficiency: an uncommon cause of hyperferritinaemia.,"Isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency (IAD) is a rare disorder but not a known cause of hyperferritinaemia. We here report a man with IAD who presented with mild anaemia and unexpected hyperferritinaemia (serum ferritin, 1796 µg/L). He had high serum hepcidin and relatively low erythropoietin levels for his anaemia, with hepcidin and ferritin levels reducing with hydrocortisone supplementation. We speculate that low glucocorticoid levels might suppress erythropoiesis and anti-inflammatory activity, resulting in a higher hepcidin level and hyperferritinaemia. The possibility of adrenal insufficiency including IAD should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients with unexplained hyperferritinaemia.",no,no,no,other,biomarker,,,0
2023-11-02,37858319,ABC-AF-Stroke score predicts thromboembolism in non-anticoagulated patients following successful atrial fibrillation ablation: a report from the Chinese Atrial Fibrillation Registry.,"The age, biomarkers, and clinical history (ABC)-atrial fibrillation (AF)-Stroke score have been proposed to refine stroke risk stratification, beyond what clinical risk scores such as the CHA2DS2-VASc score can offer. This study aimed to identify risk factors associated with thromboembolism and evaluate the performance of the ABC-AF-Stroke score in predicting thromboembolism in non-anticoagulated AF patients following successful ablations.A total of 2692 patients who underwent successful ablations with discontinued anticoagulation after a 3-month blanking period in the Chinese Atrial Fibrillation Registry (CAFR) between 2013 and 2019 were included. Cox regression analysis was conducted to present the association of risk factors with thromboembolism risk. The ABC-AF-Stroke score was evaluated in terms of discrimination, including concordance index (C-index), net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), clinical utilization by decision curve analysis (DCA), and calibration by comparing the predicted risk with the observed annualized event rate.After a median follow-up of 3.5 years, 64 patients experienced thromboembolism events. Age, prior history of stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA), high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (cTnT-hs), and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were independently associated with thromboembolism risk. The ABC-AF-Stroke score performed statistically significantly better than the CHA2DS2-VASc score in terms of C-index (0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.59-0.74 vs. 0.60, 95% CI: 0.52-0.67, P = 0.030) and reclassification capacity. The DCA implied that the ABC-AF-Stroke score could identify more thromboembolism events without increasing the false positive rate compared to the CHA2DS2-VASc score. The calibration curve showed that the ABC-AF-Stroke score was well calibrated in this population.In this real-world study enrolling non-anticoagulated AF patients following successful ablations, age, prior history of stroke/TIA, level of NT-proBNP, and cTnT-hs were independently associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism. The ABC-AF-Stroke score was well-calibrated and statistically significantly outperformed the CHA2DS2-VASc score in predicting thromboembolism risk.",no,no,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, biomarker",,,0
2023-11-02,37906299,Comparing continent ileostomy (CI) conversion to repair/redo IPAA: favorable outcomes.,"This study aims to compare the outcomes of repair/redo ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (repair/redo-IPAA) with the conversion of IPAA to continent ileostomy (CI) in an effort to prevent the need for a permanent ileostomy (IS) following IPAA failure.This research involved a retrospective analysis of surgical records, employing descriptive statistics and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.Among 57 patients with an IPAA, up to three revisions were necessary due to complications or complete failure. Ultimately, repair/redo-IPAA preserved the IPAA in 14 patients (24.6%), conversion to CI salvaged the pouch in 21 patients (36.8%), and IS was unavoidable in 22 patients (38.6%). The cumulative probability of requiring conversion surgery was calculated to be 54.0% at 20 years, thereby reducing the cumulative risk of IS to 32.3%. The 20-year cumulative probability of pouch salvage by repair/redo IPAA was only 21.9%. However, this rate increased to 67.7% when conversion procedures were considered. Following repair/redo-IPAA, only 8.3% of patients reported evacuation frequencies of ≤ 4 during the day, and 16.7% were evacuation-free at night. In contrast, after conversion to CI, 98.0% of patients reported a maximum of four evacuations in a 24-h period. After undergoing repair/redo IPAA, between half and two-thirds of patients reported experiencing incontinence or soiling, while complete continence was achieved in all patients following conversion to CI. Notably, the majority of patients expressed overall satisfaction with their respective procedures. A positive correlation was identified between very high subjective satisfaction and positive objective surgical outcomes exclusively in patients who underwent conversion to CI.When complications or failure of IPAA occur, conversion to CI emerges as a highly viable alternative to repair/redo IPAA. This conclusion is supported by the observation that patient satisfaction appears to be closely tied to stable surgical outcomes. To reinforce these findings, further prospective studies are warranted.",no,no,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,,0
2023-11-03,36927973,Early Initiation of Dapagliflozin during Hospitalization for Acute Heart Failure Is Associated with a Shorter Hospital Stay.,"Objective Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), such as dapagliflozin, have a diuretic effect, and their early initiation to treat acute heart failure (AHF) may improve outcomes; however, the significance of the timing of starting dapagliflozin after hospital admission remains unclear. Methods We performed a post hoc analysis of a prospective, observational registry. Participants were divided into the early (E) group and late (L) group using the median time to the initiation of dapagliflozin (6 days) as the cut-off. We evaluated the relationship between the time to the initiation of dapagliflozin after hospital admission and patient characteristics and the length of the hospital stay. Patients Study subjects were 118 patients with AHF admitted between January 2021 and April 2022 who were started on dapagliflozin treatment (10 mg/day). Results Patients were divided into the E group (n=63) and L group (n=55). The HF severity as evaluated by the New York Heart Association class and the N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide level was not significantly different between the groups. The time to the initiation of dapagliflozin and length of hospital stay showed a significant positive correlation (p<0.001, r=0.46). The hospital stay was significantly shorter in group E [median, 16.5 days; interquartile range (IQR): 13-22 days] than in group L (median, 22 days; IQR: 17-27 days; p=0.002). A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the early initiation of dapagliflozin was independently associated with a shorter hospital stay, even after multiple adjustments. Conclusion Early initiation of dapagliflozin after hospital admission is associated with a shorter hospital stay, suggesting it is a key factor for shortening hospital stays.",no,no,no,human non-RCT,effectiveness,,,0
2023-11-03,37916144,Management of small cell lung cancer complicated with paraneoplastic Cushing's syndrome: a systematic literature review.,"Paraneoplastic Cushing's syndrome (PCS) is a rare, but clinically important feature of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) that is associated with even worse prognosis. To identify key considerations in comprehensive management of SCLC patients complicated with PCS, we conducted a systematic review of relevant reports on PubMed and Web of Science, focusing on SCLC with PCS cases. The systematic review analyzed 61 reports published between 1985 and 2022 with a total of 157 SCLC patients included. Out of the 157 patients, 132 (84.1%) patients across 58 (95.1%) reports were diagnosed with ectopic Cushing's syndrome. The immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was performed on 30 (19.1%) patients across 22 (36.1%) reports and demonstrated encouraging performance. For treatment, chemotherapy and ketoconazole were utilized in 50 (81.97%) and 24 (39.34%) reports, respectively. Regarding cause of death, infection and cancer were equally frequent, each being recorded in 17 (27.87%) reports. To conclude, the majority of PCS cases in SCLC patients were caused by ectopic hormone secretion. In order to make a differential diagnosis, it is recommended to utilize IHC staining for a specific hormone such as ACTH or corticotropin-releasing hormone. In the comprehensive treatment of SCLC with PCS patients, effective management of hypercortisolism and potent safeguarding against infection play two crucial roles. Ultimately, further confirmations are required regarding the specificity and accuracy of IHC staining technique as well as the efficacy and safety of immunotherapy in the treatment of SCLC with PCS patients.",no,no,yes,other,"effectiveness, safety, diagnostic",,,0
2023-11-06,36263471,Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity in patients with primary polydipsia compared to healthy controls.,"Primary polydipsia is characterized by excessive fluid intake which may suppress vasopressin levels. It is speculated that suppressed vasopressin levels lead to a dysregulated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis as vasopressin co-modulates the HPA axis. However, data are contradictory. The aim of this study was to investigate markers of the HPA axis in patients with primary polydipsia compared to healthy controls.Exploratory analysis combining data from two different prospective observational studies.We included 34 patients with primary polydipsia (68% females, median aged 29.5 years (interquartile range, IQR: 26.0, 38.8) and 20 healthy controls (55% females, median age 24.0 years [IQR: 22.0, 27.2]).The main outcome was difference in HPA axis activity assessed using circadian serum and salivary cortisol, 24-h urinary free cortisol and cortisol levels before and after adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation; vasopressin suppression was assessed measuring fasting copeptin levels between patients with primary polydipsia and healthy controls using Wilcoxon rank-sum test.No difference was seen in circadian serum cortisol levels (p = .9), urinary free cortisol levels (p = .17) and serum cortisol in response to ACTH stimulation (p = .77) between groups. Circadian salivary cortisol levels were significantly lower in patients with primary polydipsia compared to healthy controls with an estimated difference of -3.7 nmol/L (95% CI: -5.5, -1.8 nmol/L, p < .001). Fasting copeptin levels were significantly lower in patients with primary polydipsia compared to healthy volunteers (p < 0.01).Our results suggest no difference in HPA axis activity between patients with primary polydipsia and healthy controls. The observed difference in salivary cortisol levels may be linked to a dilution effect in saliva rather than an altered stress axis considering the other findings.",no,no,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,,0

2023-11-06,37461146,Effect of mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor on the inflammatory response in human gingival fibroblasts cells.,"Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) is a unique member of the neurotrophic factor family residing in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it functions as a stress response protein maintaining endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis, in addition to being secreted extracellularly as a neurotrophic factor to bind with receptors to initiate intracellular signal transduction pathways. Interestingly, MANF has shown an important protective role in the inflammatory response of many diseases. In neural stem cells, pancreatic β cells, and retinal cells, MANF can inhibit the inflammatory response, modulate the immune response, and promote tissue repair. However, the role of MANF in the periodontal inflammatory response remains unclear. In the present study, we used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) to establish a Pg-LPS-stimulated periodontal inflammatory model in human gingival fibroblasts cells (HGF-1) to investigate the role of MANF in vitro. We found that MANF could inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, alleviate the endoplasmic reticulum stress response, promote cell survival, and inhibit cell apoptosis. Therefore, MANF might be a novel promising target for the treatment of periodontitis.",no,no,no,in vitro,"effectiveness, safety",,,0

Left ventricular relaxation has a high energy demand, and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction has been related to impaired energy homeostasis. This study investigated whether trimetazidine, a fatty acid oxidation inhibitor, could improve myocardial energy homeostasis and consequently improve exercise haemodynamics in patients with HFpEF.The DoPING-HFpEF trial was a phase II single-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over trial. Patients were randomized to trimetazidine treatment or placebo for 3 months and switched after a 2-week wash-out period. The primary endpoint was change in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, measured with right heart catheterization at multiple stages of bicycling exercise. Secondary endpoint was change in myocardial phosphocreatine/adenosine triphosphate, an index of the myocardial energy status, measured with phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The study included 25 patients (10/15 males/females; mean (standard deviation) age, 66 (10) years; body mass index, 29.8 (4.5) kg/m2 ); with the diagnosis of HFpEF confirmed with (exercise) right heart catheterization either before or during the trial. There was no effect of trimetazidine on the primary outcome pulmonary capillary wedge pressure at multiple levels of exercise (mean change 0 [95% confidence interval, 95% CI -2, 2] mmHg over multiple levels of exercise, P = 0.60). Myocardial phosphocreatine/adenosine triphosphate in the trimetazidine arm was similar to placebo (1.08 [0.76, 1.76] vs. 1.30 [0.95, 1.86], P = 0.08). There was no change by trimetazidine compared with placebo in the exploratory parameters: 6-min walking distance (mean change of -6 [95% CI -18, 7] m vs. -5 [95% CI -22, 22] m, respectively, P = 0.93), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (5 (-156, 166) ng/L vs. -13 (-172, 147) ng/L, P = 0.70), overall quality-of-life (KCCQ and EQ-5D-5L, P = 0.78 and P = 0.51, respectively), parameters for diastolic function measured with echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance, or metabolic parameters.Trimetazidine did not improve myocardial energy homeostasis and did not improve exercise haemodynamics in patients with HFpEF.",no,no,no,human RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,,0

In this population-based study, the patients were identified based on the International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) codes registered in the Norwegian Patient Registry (NPR), which contains information on diagnosis and time of admission for all hospitalized patients in Norway. The pSS group comprised patients with ≥4 registrations with ICD-10 code M35.0 (Sjögren's syndrome) as the main diagnosis. The dependent variable was periodontitis, defined by procedure codes registered in the Norwegian Control and Payment of Health Reimbursement (KUHR). Logistic regression analyses estimated the odds ratio for periodontitis in pSS patients relative to non-pSS patients, adjusted for relevant covariates. Lastly, regression analyses were performed separately for each of the 6 age categories. In total, 760 (7.5%) patients in the pSS group and 22,178 (7.1%) in the non-pSS group had periodontitis. When adjusting for covariates, the presence of pSS had no association with periodontitis (OR = 1.06, 95% CI: 0.98-1.14).",no,no,no,human non-RCT,,,,0

Late menarche (≥13 y) and a history of 5 or more deliveries were significantly associated with an increased risk of OAG.To determine the association between reproductive factors including age at menarche, age at menopause, reproductive period, parity, and the risk of OAG in women.PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were searched until February 9, 2022. Studies were included if they assessed the association between reproductive factors and OAG. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with relevant 95% CIs were extracted and pooled using fixed-effects models. Besides, we conducted dose-response analyses via the generalized least squares for trend method.Seven articles including 18,618 women were identified in this review. The pooled results indicated that late age at menarche (≥13 y) was significantly associated with an increased risk of OAG (OR=1.76, 95% CI: 1.28, 2.43). Early menopause (<45 y) also significantly elevated the risk of OAG (OR=1.89, 95% CI: 1.23, 2.90) in categorical meta-analyses, consistent with the inverse linear relationship between menopausal age and the risk of OAG in dose-response analyses ( P =0.002). In addition, women who had delivered at least 5 children were at significantly higher risk of OAG compared with those nulliparous (OR=2.35, 95% CI: 1.02, 5.39), and a J-shape relationship between parity and OAG was observed in dose-response analyses ( P <0.001).Late menarche (≥13 y), early menopause (<45 y), and a history of 5 or more parturitions are possible risk factors for OAG.

2023-11-06,37678265,Electrolyte Disorders in Mitochondrial Cytopathies: A Systematic Review.,"Several recent studies identified mitochondrial mutations in patients with Gitelman or Fanconi syndrome. Mitochondrial cytopathies are generally not considered in the diagnostic workup of patients with electrolyte disorders. In this systematic review, we investigated the presence of electrolyte disorders in patients with mitochondrial cytopathies to determine the relevance of mitochondrial mutation screening in this population. Our analysis demonstrates that electrolyte disorders are commonly reported in mitochondrial cytopathies, often as presenting symptoms. Consequently, more clinical attention should be raised for mitochondrial disease as cause for disturbances in electrolyte homeostasis. Further prospective cohort studies are required to determine the exact prevalence of electrolyte disorders in mitochondrial cytopathies.Electrolyte reabsorption in the kidney has a high energy demand. Proximal and distal tubular epithelial cells have a high mitochondrial density for energy release. Recently, electrolyte disorders have been reported as the primary presentation of some mitochondrial cytopathies. However, the prevalence and the pathophysiology of electrolyte disturbances in mitochondrial disease are unknown. Therefore, we systematically investigated electrolyte disorders in patients with mitochondrial cytopathies.We searched PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar for articles on genetically confirmed mitochondrial disease in patients for whom at least one electrolyte is reported. Patients with a known second genetic anomaly were excluded. We evaluated 214 case series and reports (362 patients) as well as nine observational studies. Joanna Briggs Institute criteria were used to evaluate the quality of included studies.Of 362 reported patients, 289 had an electrolyte disorder, with it being the presenting or main symptom in 38 patients. The average number of different electrolyte abnormalities per patient ranged from 2.4 to 1.0, depending on genotype. Patients with mitochondrial DNA structural variants seemed most affected. Reported pathophysiologic mechanisms included renal tubulopathies and hormonal, gastrointestinal, and iatrogenic causes.Mitochondrial diseases should be considered in the evaluation of unexplained electrolyte disorders. Furthermore, clinicians should be aware of electrolyte abnormalities in patients with mitochondrial disease.",no,no,yes,other,diagnostic,,,0
2023-11-06,37804664,ACTH impairs the migratory and secretory profile of mononuclear cells during proestrus in cattle.,"The aim was to evaluate the effect of ACTH on the mechanisms involved in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) infiltration into the ovary during dairy cattle proestrus. Regarding this, proper expression pattern of adhesion molecules must take place both in PBMCs and in endothelial cells. Argentinian Holstein cows (n = 12) were treated with 100 IU of ACTH every 12 h for 4 days before ovulation when ovariectomy was performed (day 18). Blood samples were taken on day 15 (0 h) and immediately before (72 h) and after (74 h) the last ACTH administration. In PBMCs, flow cytometry was performed to analyze CD44, CD11b and CD62-L expression along with gene expression of chemokines' receptors. Interleukin (IL)-4 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production was analyzed by flow cytometry after exposing PBMCs to autologous follicular fluid. In ovarian blood vessels, expression of the vascular endothelium cell adhesion-1 (VCAM-1) and the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. In T-lymphocytes, the expression of CD44 and CD11b was lower at 72 h in ACTH-treated cows (P < 0.05). In monocytes, the expression of CD11b and CD62-L was lower at 72 h in ACTH-treated cows (P < 0.05). Also, the percentage of IL-4+ cells was higher in ACTH-treated cows, meanwhile, the percentage TNF-α+ cells was lower in ACTH-treated cows (P < 0.05). Finally, in the vessels associated with the preovulatory follicle VCAM-1 immunoexpression was lower in ACTH-treated cows (P < 0.05).

Home waking salivary cortisone is an accurate screening test for adrenal insufficiency, it has potential to reduce costs, and patients prefer it to the adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) (synacthen) stimulation test. We carried out a service evaluation of home waking salivary cortisone in clinical care to identify implementation barriers.Service evaluation in a centre where 212 patients referred for adrenal insufficiency had a waking salivary cortisone. Problems encountered during testing were recorded and patient feedback, via focus groups, collected.From all patients providing a waking salivary cortisone 55% had a normal test, 23% adrenal suppression, and 22% an equivocal result requiring a clinical centre ACTH stimulation test. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) for the time of the saliva sample was 07:40 (07:00-08:40). The median (IQR) days between collection and (i) delivery to local laboratory was 1 (0.25-2) day; (ii) reporting by local laboratory was 13 (11-18) days. Patients considered the test is ""easy to do"" and preferred it to the inpatient ACTH stimulation test. The principal challenge to clinical implementation was results reporting to clinicians due to delays at the local laboratory.This service evaluation provides real-world evidence that home waking salivary cortisone is an effective, practical screening test for adrenal insufficiency.

In contrast, there is limited information on the presence and activity of AOX in extrahepatic tissues including ocular tissues. Because several ocular drugs are potential substrates for AOX, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the AOX1 expression and activity profile in seven ocular tissues from humans, rabbits, and pigs. AOX activities were determined using optimized assays for the established human AOX1 probe substrates 4-dimethylamino-cinnamaldehyde (DMAC) and phthalazine. Inhibition studies were undertaken in conjunctival and retinal homogenates using well-established human AOX1 inhibitors menadione and chlorpromazine. AOX1 protein contents were quantitated with targeted proteomics and confirmed by immunoblotting. Overall, DMAC oxidation rates varied over 10-fold between species (human ˃˃ rabbit ˃ pig) and showed 2- to 6-fold differences between tissues from the same species. Menadione seemed a more potent inhibitor of DMAC oxidation across species than chlorpromazine. Human AOX1 protein levels were highest in the conjunctiva, followed by most posterior tissues, whereas anterior tissues showed low levels. The rabbit AOX1 expression was high in the conjunctiva, retinal pigment epithelial (RPE), and choroid while lower in the anterior tissues. Quantification of pig AOX1 was not successful but immunoblotting confirmed the presence of AOX1 in all species. DMAC oxidation rates and AOX1 contents correlated quite well in humans and rabbits.

Patients with MACE were selected as the case group (n = 55), and age- and gender-matched patients without MACE were selected as the control group (n = 55). Clinical data for the two groups was compared by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Risk factors and the odds ratio (OR) for MACE in ACS patients were evaluated, and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) were used to evaluate the Lp(a)/PA ratio, the NT-proBNP/LVEF ratio, and their combination for the prediction of MACE in ACS patients.The MACE and non-MACE groups showed statistically significant differences for time from onset to PCI, LVEF, NT-proBNP, white blood cell (WBC), Lp(a), PA, Lp(a)/PA, NT-proBNP/LVEF, number of catheterizations, number of implanted stents >2, and support diameter >3 (p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that LVEF, Lp(a)/PA and NT-proBNP/LVEF were independent risk factors for MACE. ROC curve analysis for Lp(a)/PA showed that the area under the curve (AUC) for the prediction of MACE was 0.779 (0.693-0.864), the cut-off point was 1.36, the sensitivity was 69.1%, and the specificity was 74.5%.

The prevalences were estimated from available national data, with consideration of international data.Screening by 2 authors yielded 263 hits, of which 18 routine data analyses and 2 surveys met the inclusion criteria. Prevalence data ranged from 0.42% to 1.85% (rheumatoid arthritis), 0.32-0.5% (ankylosing spondylitis), 0.11-0.32% (psoriatic arthritis), 0.037-0.14% (systemic lupus erythematosus), 0.07-0.77% (Sjoegren's disease/sicca syndrome), 0.14-0.15% (polymyalgia rheumatica, ≥ 40 years), 0.04-0.05% (giant cell arteritis, ≥ 50 years), and 0.015-0.026% (ANCA-associated vasculitis). The risk of bias was moderate in 13 and high in 7 studies. Based on the results, we estimate the prevalence of IRD in Germany to be 2.2-3.0%, which corresponds to approximately 1.5-2.1 million affected individuals. Prevalence data of juvenile idiopathic arthritis was reported to be around 0.10% (0.07-0.10%) of patients 0-18 years old, corresponding to about 14,000 children and adolescents in Germany.This systematic review shows an increase in the prevalence of IRD in Germany, which is almost exclusively based on routine data analyses.

2023-11-07,37929515,Convalescent plasma therapy in critically İll COVID-19 patients: A retrospective cohort study.,"Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy can be defined as a passive immunity transfer approach involving the administration of plasma for therapeutic purposes to inpatients hospitalized due to an active virus infection. Passive immunity antibodies can reduce target organ damage and directly neutralize the responsible pathogens. A limited number of studies on the use of CP have reported that critically ill patients can benefit from CP therapy.We aimed in this study as the outcomes of CP therapy in critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in intensive care unit (ICU) and determine the differences between the recovery and mortality groups.This retrospective design study involved critically ill patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia or who were suspected of having COVID-19 in the ICU between April 1, 2020, and June 1, 2020. Comorbidity of patients, respiratory findings, hemodynamic data, laboratory data, and poor prognostic measures were compared between mortality and recovery group.Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy was supplied for 41 (13.58%) patients in total of 302 COVID-19 patients. Twenty-nine patients were died in total of 41 COVID-19 patients who supplied CP therapy. The mortality rate is 70.73% in CP therapy. There was a significantly higher incidence (P < 0.021) of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and significantly lower mean arterial pressure (MAP) values in mortality group (P < 0.05). There were significantly higher NLR values (P < 0.05), lower platelet count (P < 0.05), lower of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) level (P < 0.05), higher creatinine values (P < 0.05), higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (P < 0.05), higher D-dimer levels (P < 0.05), higher level of pro-brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) (P = 0.000), rate of fever (P = 0.031), arrythmia (P = 0.024), and transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) (P = 0.008) were more often in mortality group.Convalescent plasma therapy seems not useful in critically ill COVID-19 patients.",no,no,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,,0
2023-11-08,37302106,Low-dose naltrexone's utility for non-cancer centralized pain conditions: a scoping review.,"At low doses, naltrexone (LDN) has been shown to modulate inflammation through the interruption of microglial cell activation within the central nervous system. One of the most likely contributors to centralized pain is changes in microglial cell processing. Therefore, it has been postulated that LDN can be used to manage patients with pain resulting from central sensitization due to this relationship. This scoping review aims to synthesize the relevant study data for LDN as a novel treatment strategy for various centralized pain conditions.A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar, guided by the Scale for Assessment of Narrative Review Articles (SANRA) criteria.Forty-seven studies related to centralized pain conditions were identified. Many of the studies were case reports/series and narrative reviews, but a few randomized control trials have been conducted. Overall, the body of evidence revealed improvement in patient-reported pain severity and in outcomes related to hyperalgesia, physical function, quality of life, and sleep. Variability in dosing paradigms and the time to patient response was present in the reviewed studies.Evidence synthesized for this scoping review supports the ongoing use of LDN for the treatment of refractory pain in various centralized chronic pain conditions. Upon review of the currently available published studies, it is apparent that further high-quality, well-powered randomized control trials need to be conducted to establish efficacy, standardization for dosing, and response times. In summary, LDN continues to offer promising results in the management of pain and other distressing symptoms in patients with chronic centralized pain conditions.",no,no,yes,other,effectiveness,,,0
2023-11-08,37680141,Prevalence of geographic atrophy in Nordic countries and number of patients potentially eligible for intravitreal complement inhibitor treatment: A systematic review with meta-analyses and forecasting study.,"We systematically reviewed the literature on the prevalence of geographic atrophy (GA) in Nordic populations, conducted meta-analyses on age-stratified estimates, and calculated current and future number of patients and those potentially eligible for intravitreal complement inhibitor treatment. We followed the PRISMA guidelines, and our protocol was registered in PROSPERO. Ten databases were searched on 22 April 2023 for population-based studies of GA prevalence. Based on clinical descriptive analyses of GA and eligibility criteria of the phase III studies for intravitreal pegcetacoplan (complement C3 and C3b inhibitor), we were able to calculate the proportion of patients with GA potentially eligible for therapy. Finally, we extracted population data for Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden) from Eurostat, applied prevalence statistics to the extracted census and forecasting data to estimate the number of patients with GA, and then applied the proportion eligible for intravitreal pegcetacoplan therapy. We identified six studies with a total of 10 159 individuals. Prevalence of GA was estimated to 0.4% (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.2%-0.8%), 1.5% (95% CI: 0.7%-2.6%), and 7.6% (95% CI: 4.6%-11.3%) for individuals aged 60-69, 70-79, and 80+ years, respectively. In Nordic countries, we estimate a total of 166 307 individuals with GA in 2023, increasing to 277 893 in 2050. Of these, 90 803 individuals in 2023, increasing to 151 730 in 2050, are potentially eligible for intravitreal complement inhibitor treatment.

Due to the rarity of this condition, diagnosis and treatment can be challenging. Diagnosis is based on the presence of the clinical triad of central nervous system dysfunction, branch retinal artery occlusions and sensorineural hearing loss. Typical MRI findings of callosal and peri-callosal lesions may assist in diagnosis. Clinical course can be monophasic, polycyclic or chronic continuous. It is important to look out for red flags to attain an accurate diagnosis and follow a therapeutic algorithm based on severity of the disease and response to treatment. Patients are treated with steroids and immunosuppressive agents with a variable response. Early aggressive treatment especially in severe cases, may help in preventing relapses and morbidity/disability.

The association of left atrial appendage flow velocity (LAA-FV) on TEE with ICM-detected AF is yet to be elucidated.CRYPTON-ICM (CRYPTOgenic stroke evaluation in Nippon using ICM) is a multicenter registry of cryptogenic stroke with ICM implantation, and patients whose LAA-FV was evaluated on TEE were enrolled. The primary outcome was the detection of AF (> 2 min) on ICM. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine the optimal cut-off of LAA-FV, and factors associated with ICM-detected AF were assessed.A total of 307 patients (age 66.6 ± 12.3 years; 199 males) with median follow-up of 440 (interquartile range 169-726) days were enrolled; AF was detected in 101 patients. The lower-tertile LAA-FV group had older age, more history of congestive heart failure, and higher levels of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal proBNP (all P < 0.05). On ROC analysis, LAA-FV < 37.5 cm/s predicted ICM-detected AF with sensitivity of 26.7% and specificity of 92.2%. After adjustment for covariates, the lower tertile of LAA-FV (hazard ratio [HR], 1.753 [1.017-3.021], P = 0.043) and LAA-FV < 37.5 cm/s (HR 1.987 [1.240-3.184], P = 0.004) predicted ICM-detected AF.LAA-FV < 37.5 cm/s predicts AF.

2023-11-09,37657070,Alpha-lipoic Acid Protects Against Chronic Alcohol Consumption-induced Cardiac Damage by the Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 2-associated PINK/Parkin Pathway.,"Chronic alcohol intake contributes to high mortality rates due to ethanol-induced cardiac hypertrophy and contractile dysfunction, which are accompanied by increased oxidative stress and disrupted mitophagy. Alpha-lipoic acid (α-LA), a well-known antioxidant, has been shown to protect against cardiac hypertrophy and inflammation. However, little is known about its role and mechanism in the treatment of alcoholic cardiomyopathy. Here, we evaluated the role of α-LA in alcohol-induced cardiac damage by feeding mice a 4.8% (v/v) alcohol diet with or without α-LA for 6 w. Our results suggested that chronic alcohol consumption increased mortality, blood alcohol concentrations, and serum aldehyde levels, but a-LA attenuated the elevations in mortality and aldehydes. Chronic alcohol intake also induced cardiac dysfunction, including enlarged left ventricles, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, enhanced cardiomyocyte size, and increased serum levels of brain natriuretic peptide, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase myocardial isoenzyme. Moreover, alcohol intake led to the accumulation of collagen fiber and mitochondrial dysfunction, the effects of which were alleviated by α-LA. In addition, α-LA intake also prevented the increase in reactive oxygen species production and the decrease in mitochondrial number that were observed after alcohol consumption. Chronic alcohol exposure activated PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. These effects were diminished by α-LA intake by the activation of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2. Our data indicated that α-LA helps protect cardiac cells against the effects of chronic alcohol intake, likely by inhibiting PINK1/Parkin-related mitophagy through the activation of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2.",no,no,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety",,,0
2023-11-09,37668702,Clinical characteristics and treatment approaches in patients with Susac syndrome: a scoping review of cases.,"Susac syndrome (SuS) is a rare disease characterized by encephalopathy, hearing impairment and visual disturbances. Immunosuppressive treatments are used based on the hypothesis that an autoimmune endotheliopathy drives the disease. However, a solid evidence-based treatment approach is lacking. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of patient characteristics, disease course and treatment patterns related to successful outcome that have been reported in literature since 2013.Three reviewers conducted a systematic literature search in February 2022. The primary outcome was treatment used, derived from cases classified as probable or definite SuS, describing successful treatment outcome (i.e. no signs of disease activity for ≥ 1 month). Secondary outcomes were time-to-relapse and follow-up time. Published case reports and case series were included. Various clinical characteristics and treatment(s) were extracted and categorized into different phases of treatment.A total of 810 records was identified. 120 articles met inclusion criteria and 161 cases were extracted. Of these, 151 cases were classified as probable or definite SuS and included in the final analysis. Number of combinations of treatments used per treatment phase were: 6 empirically, 35 after confirmed diagnosis, 43 for maintenance treatment, 22 after relapse, 18 during maintenance post-relapse. Median follow-up time was 12.3 months (0.5; 120) and median time to relapse was 4 months (1; 120).This scoping review summarizes treatment approaches in patients with SuS, highlighting variability. International efforts to collect clinical, imaging and treatment data from patients with SuS in registries are needed, in order to provide less biased and long-term follow-up information on treatment response, predictors of relapse and patient outcomes.

2023-11-09,37672268,Cardiac Remodeling in Subclinical Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: The VANISH Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Valsartan has shown promise in attenuating cardiac remodeling in patients with early-stage sarcomeric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Genetic testing can identify individuals at risk of HCM in a subclinical stage who could benefit from therapies that prevent disease progression.To explore the potential for valsartan to modify disease development, and to characterize short-term phenotypic progression in subclinical HCM.The multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled Valsartan for Attenuating Disease Evolution in Early Sarcomeric Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (VANISH) randomized clinical trial was conducted from April 2014 to July 2019 at 17 sites in 4 countries (Brazil, Canada, Denmark, and the US), with 2 years of follow-up. The prespecified exploratory VANISH cohort studied here included sarcomere variant carriers with subclinical HCM and early phenotypic manifestations (reduced E' velocity, electrocardiographic abnormalities, or an increased left ventricular [LV] wall thickness [LVWT] to cavity diameter ratio) but no LV hypertrophy (LVH). Data were analyzed between March and December 2022.Treatment with placebo or valsartan (80 mg/d for children weighing <35 kg, 160 mg/d for children weighing ≥35 kg, or 320 mg/d for adults aged ≥18 years).The primary outcome was a composite z score incorporating changes in 9 parameters of cardiac remodeling (LV cavity volume, LVWT, and LV mass; left atrial [LA] volume; E' velocity and S' velocity; and serum troponin and N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide levels).This study included 34 participants, with a mean (SD) age of 16 (5) years (all were White). A total of 18 participants (8 female [44%] and 10 male [56%]) were randomized to valsartan and 16 (9 female [56%] and 7 male [44%]) were randomized to placebo. No statistically significant effects of valsartan on cardiac remodeling were detected (mean change in composite z score compared with placebo: -0.01 [95% CI, -0.29 to 0.26]; P = .92). Overall, 2-year phenotypic progression was modest, with only a mild increase in LA volume detected (increased by 3.5 mL/m2 [95% CI, 1.4-6.0 mL/m2]; P = .002). Nine participants (26%) had increased LVWT, including 6 (18%) who developed clinically overt HCM. Baseline LA volume index (LAVI; 35 vs 28 mL/m2; P = .01) and average interventricular septum thickness (8.5 vs 7.0 mm; P = .009) were higher in participants who developed HCM.In this exploratory cohort, valsartan was not proven to slow progression of subclinical HCM. Minimal changes in markers of cardiac remodeling were observed, although nearly one-fifth of patients developed clinically overt HCM. Transition to disease was associated with greater baseline interventricular septum thickness and LAVI. These findings highlight the importance of following sarcomere variant carriers longitudinally and the critical need to improve understanding of factors that drive disease penetrance and progression.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01912534.",no,no,no,human RCT,"effectiveness, biomarker",,,0
2023-11-09,37936106,Performance of synacthen test in chronic hemodialysis patients.,"Adrenal function tests (Synacthen test) in chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients are currently performed off dialysis. The study aimed to demonstrate equivalence of serum cortisol concentrations pre- and during HD, each for standard-dose (250 µg) and low-dose (1 µg) Synacthen test.In a single-center cross-over diagnostic equivalence study, Synacthen tests were performed in four settings, in standard- and low-dose as well as pre- and during HD. Serum cortisol concentration was measured at 30 and 60 min after Synacthen administration, and additionally at 20 min in low dose test. Based on a multivariable linear mixed model the means of cortisol concentration on log-scale were estimated in each dose and test time combination. Differences in means were calculated and the TOST approach was applied to test for equivalence. Equivalence was proven if the 90% confidence interval of the difference of two cortisol means was entirely between - 0.22 and 0.22.In 28 chronic HD patients, serum cortisol concentrations at 30 and 60 min after Synacthen administration in both standard- and low-dose were shown to be equivalent pre- and during HD. In 10 of 56 low-dose tests, the cortisol peak was already reached after 20 min. However, cortisol concentrations at 20 and 30 min after low-dose Synacthen test pre- and during HD showed no significant difference.These results suggest that the adrenal function test may be carried out during an ongoing HD session, leading to a more patient-friendly performance of the test, less organizational effort and potentially earlier diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency.",no,no,no,human non-RCT,diagnostic,,,0

Aim of the study was to define 1HG cutoffs diagnostic of incident impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in youths with obesity, and to evaluate prevalence and association of cutoffs identified in the cohort and from the literature (133 and 155 mg/dl) to cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a population of youths with obesity.This is a longitudinal study of 154 youths to identify 1HG cutoffs, and cross-sectional study of 2295 youths to estimate prevalence of high 1HG and association to CVD. Receiver-operating characteristic curves (ROC) were used to establish 1HG cutoffs, and univariate regression analyses to test association of 1HG to blood pressure, lipids and aminotransferases.ROC analysis identified the 1HG cutoff of 159 mg/dl as having diagnostic accuracy of IGT with area under the ROC 0.82 (95% CI 0.66-0.98), sensitivity 0.86% and specificity 0.79%. In the cross-sectional population, prevalence of high 1HG was 36% and 15% for 133 and 155 mg/dl cutoffs, respectively, and 17% for the 159 mg/dl value. All the examined cutoffs were significantly associated with worse lipid profile, liver function test, reduced insulin sensitivity, secretion and disposition index.High 1HG is marker of persistent IGT and increased risk of metabolic abnormalities in youths. The 155 mg/dl cutoff is a convenient estimate in young people but longitudinal studies with retinopathy and overt diabetes as end points are advised to verify the 1HG cutoff with the best diagnostic accuracy.",no,no,no,human non-RCT,"diagnostic, biomarker",,,0

We thus performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on the blood concentrations of ACTH, LH and FSH, GH, PRL, and TSH in drug-naïve people with first-episode psychosis (FEP) as compared with healthy controls.We searched Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycInfo for articles indexed until September 2022. Data quality was appraised. Random-effects meta-analyses were carried out, generating pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs). Between-study heterogeneity was estimated using the I2 statistic. Sensitivity and meta-regression analyses were performed.Twenty-six studies were included. Drug-naïve people with FEP, compared to healthy subjects, had higher blood concentrations of ACTH (k = 7; N = 548; SMD = 0.62; 95%CI: 0.29 to 0.94; p < 0.001; I2 = 60.9%) and PRL (k = 17; N = 1757; SMD = 0.85; 95%CI: 0.56 to 1.14; p < 0.001; I2 = 85.5%) as well as lower levels of TSH (k = 6; N = 677; SMD = -0.34; 95%CI: -0.54 to -0.14; p = 0.001; I2 = 29.1%). Meta-regressions did not show any moderating effect of age (p = 0.78), sex (p = 0.21), or symptom severity (p = 0.87) on PRL concentrations in drug-naïve FEP. Available data were not sufficient to perform meta-analyses on FSH, LH, and GH.Drug-naïve people with FEP have altered ACTH, PRL, and TSH blood concentrations, supporting the hypothesis that an abnormal anterior pituitary hormone secretion may be involved in the onset of schizophrenia and psychoses.

MOGAD participants completed the EnvIMS questionnaire, and were compared to unaffected controls from the Canadian arm of EnvIMS. We calculated crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) using logistic regression models and Firth's procedure for rare events.We enrolled 39 MOGAD participants with mean (SD) age 45.0 (14.4) years, 28 (71.8 %) women, 25 (64.1 %) White, 26 (66.7 %) residents of Ontario, and mean BMI 28.6 (7.1).

Among Ontario residents, current BMI ≥30 was associated with higher odds of MOGAD (OR:2.79, 95 % CI:1.03-7.53).Our findings are hypothesis-generating due to the sample size, but suggest that obesity and ethnicity should be explored as potential risk factors for MOGAD in other settings.",no,no,no,human non-RCT,,,,0
2023-11-10,37833068,Impact and Role of Hypothalamic Corticotropin Releasing Hormone Neurons in Withdrawal from Chronic Alcohol Consumption in Female and Male Mice.,"Worldwide, alcohol use and abuse are a leading risk of mortality, causing 5.3% of all deaths (World Health Organization, 2022). The endocrine stress system, initiated by the peripheral release of corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) from primarily glutamatergic neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), is profoundly linked with alcohol use, abuse, and relapse (Blaine and Sinha, 2017). These PVN CRH-releasing (PVNCRH) neurons are essential for peripheral and central stress responses (Rasiah et al., 2023), but little is known about how alcohol affects these neurons. Here, we show that two-bottle choice alcohol consumption blunts the endocrine-mediated corticosterone response to stress during acute withdrawal in female mice. Conversely, using slice electrophysiology, we demonstrate that acute withdrawal engenders a hyperexcitable phenotype of PVNCRH neurons in females that is accompanied by increased glutamatergic transmission in both male and female mice. GABAergic synaptic transmission was unaffected by alcohol history. We then tested whether chemogenetic inhibition of PVNCRH neurons would restore stress response in female mice with a history of alcohol drinking in the looming disk test, which mimics an approaching predator threat. Accordingly, inhibition of PVNCRH neurons reduced active escape in hM4Di alcohol history mice only. This study indicates that stress-responsive PVNCRH neurons in females are particularly affected by a history of alcohol consumption. Interestingly, women have indicated an increase in heavy alcohol use to cope with stress (Rodriguez et al., 2020), perhaps pointing to a potential underlying mechanism in alcohol-mediated changes to PVNCRH neurons that alter stress response.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus neurons that release corticotropin releasing hormone (PVNCRH) are vital for stress response. These neurons have been understudied in relation to alcohol and withdrawal despite profound relations between stress, alcohol use disorders (AUD), and relapse. In this study, we use a variety of techniques to show that acute withdrawal from a history of alcohol impacts peripheral stress response, PVNCRH neurons, and behavior. Specifically, PVNCRH are in a hyperactive state during withdrawal, which drives an increase in active stress coping behaviors in female mice only. Understanding how alcohol use and withdrawal affects stress responding PVNCRH neurons may contribute to finding new potential targets for the treatment of alcohol use disorder.",no,no,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,,0

This suggests that important pathways are not yet targeted by current heart failure therapies.We sought integration of genetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data in a large cohort of patients with heart failure to detect major pathways related to progression of heart failure leading to death.We used machine learning methodology based on stacked generalization framework and gradient boosting algorithms, using 54 clinical phenotypes, 403 circulating plasma proteins, 36,046 transcript expression levels in whole blood, and 6 million genomic markers to model all-cause mortality in 2,516 patients with heart failure from the BIOSTAT-CHF (Systems BIOlogy Study to TAilored Treatment in Chronic Heart Failure) study. Results were validated in an independent cohort of 1,738 patients.The mean age of the patients was 70 years (Q1-Q3: 61-78 years), 27% were female, median N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide was 4,275 ng/L (Q1-Q3: 2,360-8,486 ng/L), and 7% had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. During a median follow-up of 21 months, 657 (26%) of patients died. The 4 major pathways with a significant association to all-cause mortality were: 1) the PI3K/Akt pathway; 2) the MAPK pathway; 3) the Ras signaling pathway; and 4) epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance. Results were validated in an independent cohort of 1,738 patients.A systems biology approach integrating genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data identified 4 major pathways related to mortality.

2023-11-13,37530940,Hydroxychloroquine in nephrology: current status and future directions.,"Hydroxychloroquine is one of the oldest disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs in clinical use. The drug interferes with lysosomal activity and antigen presentation, inhibits autophagy, and decreases transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Owing to its immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic effect, hydroxychloroquine has been an integral part of therapy for systemic lupus erythematosus and lupus nephritis for several decades. The therapeutic versatility of hydroxychloroquine has led to repurposing it for other clinical conditions, with recent studies showing reduction in proteinuria in IgA nephropathy. Research is also underway to investigate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in primary membranous nephropathy, Alport's syndrome, systemic vasculitis, anti-GBM disease, acute kidney injury and for cardiovascular risk reduction in chronic kidney disease. Hydroxychloroquine is well-tolerated, inexpensive, and widely available and therefore, should its indications expand in the future, it would certainly be welcomed. However, clinicians should be aware of the risk of irreversible and progressive retinal toxicity and rarely, cardiomyopathy. Monitoring hydroxychloroquine levels in blood appears to be a promising tool to evaluate compliance, individualize the dose and reduce the risk of retinal toxicity, although this is not yet standard clinical practice. In this review, we discuss the existing knowledge regarding the mechanism of action of hydroxychloroquine, its utility in lupus nephritis and other kidney diseases, the main adverse effects and the evidence gaps that need to be addressed in future research.

Polysomnographic analysis was performed. Blood samples were collected at 08:00 AM for analysis of ACTH and basal cortisol, and at 00:00 AM for midnight cortisol levels. The frequency and power of the slow wave activity (SWA), theta, alpha, and beta waves of the first and last non-rapid eye movement (NREM) cycles were measured with a spectral analysis program.The CS patient group had higher SWA power, especially in the first NREM cycle. In the ACTH-dependent group, SWA maximum and mean power values were higher in the frontal channels in the first NREM, compared to the last NREM sleep stage (p<0.05).Cortisol has been found to be associated with SWA waves, making these waves higher in power, especially in the first NREM phase. This difference was much less pronounced in the final NREM sleep stage.

Patients are generally diagnosed at ages between five and fifteen years when they exhibit three or more manifestations, most typically mucocutaneous candidiasis, autoimmune Addison's disease, and hypoparathyroidism. Our study aims to report the first case of a Chinese APS-1 patient, presented with LCA as the initial and essential clinical feature of this rare syndrome.Detailed medical and family history were recorded for the patient. Also, the comprehensive ophthalmological examinations were conducted. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was applied to screen pathogenic variants. Sanger sequencing validation and segregation analysis were further performed for confirmation.A 3-year-old boy with severely impaired vision and initially referred as LCA. However, with a detailed history review, oral candidiasis, dental enamel hypoplasia, and nail candida infection were revealed. Moreover, genetic analysis revealed the homozygous c.769C>T (p.R257X) in AIRE gene (NM_000383.3) as the causative variant.We presented one case diagnosed with APS-1 based on clinical characteristics and genetic analysis. Our study demonstrated that LCA could serve as a warning sign for APS-1 and a potential trigger of early screening, which might prevent life-threatening complications.",no,no,no,human non-RCT,diagnostic,,,0

We report three new cases and perform a systematic review of paediatric EAS.Case records of paediatric and adolescent EAS patient's ≤20 years presenting at our centre between 1997 and 2021 were retrospectively reviewed, and a systematic review of the literature published between January 1970 and December 2022 was performed.A total of 161 patients including 3 new patients from our centre were identified. Bronchial neuroendocrine tumours (NET) (28.5%), thymic NET (22.9%), primitive cell-derived tumours (18.6%), and gastro-entero-pancreatic-NET (13.7%) were the common causes. Primitive cell-derived tumours were the most common in the first decade (24/45, 53.4%) and were the largest (82 [60-100] mm), whereas bronchial NETs predominated during the second decade (42/116, 36.2%) and were the smallest (15 [10-25] mm). Computed tomography localized 92.9% (118/127) of paediatric EAS patients. Immediate postoperative remission was attained in 77.9% (88/113) patients, whereas 30.4% (24/79) relapsed over a median (IQR) period of 13 (8-36) months. Over a median (IQR) follow-up of 2 (0.6-4.6) years, 31.4% of patients died. The median survival was higher in bronchial NET than in other tumour groups. Distant metastasis and tumour size were independent negative predictors of survival.Aetiological profile of paediatric and adolescent EAS is distinct from that of adults.

2023-11-13,37861261,The Usefulness of the TAPSE/sPAP Ratio for Predicting Survival in Medically Treated Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension.,"The ventriculoarterial uncoupling has been linked with unfavorable results as measured noninvasively by tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion divided by systolic pulmonary artery pressure (TAPSE/sPAP). However, its prognostic importance in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is limited. Thus, we determine the effect of the TAPSE/sPAP ratio on outcomes and predictors of all-cause mortality in these patients.We analyzed 56 subjects with medically treated CTEPH. Two-dimensional echocardiographic examination and right heart catheterization findings were recorded from the hospital database. Baseline New York Heart Association functional class (NYHA-FC), 6-min walk distance (6MWD), and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) test results were recorded.The median age was 65.5 years. Over a median follow-up time of 27 months, 29 (51.8%) patients died. BNP values were higher (P = 0.008), 6MWD values were lower (P = 0.004), and NHYA-FC (P = 0.0001) was worse in the non-survivor group. TAPSE (P = 0.0001) and TAPSE/sPAP ratio (P = 0.001) were significantly lower and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was higher in the non-survivor group (P = 0.03). The best cut-off value for the TAPSE/sPAP ratio for predicting mortality was 0.20 mm/mmHg and the survival rates were significantly lower in the TAPSE/sPAP ratio ≤0.20 group (log-rank P = 0.012). 6MWD (P = 0.005), NHYA-FC III-IV (P = 0.0001), TAPSE/sPAP ratio ≤0.20 (P = 0.017), PVR (P = 0.008), and TAPSE/sPAP ratio ≤0.20 combined with NYHA-FC III-IV (P = 0.0001) were significant determinants and TAPSE/sPAP ratio ≤0.20 combined with NYHA-FC III-IV was the only independent predictor of mortality (P = 0.003).Medically treated CTEPH patients with a TAPSE/sPAP ratio ≤0.20 had lower survival rates. TAPSE/sPAP ratio≤0.20 combined with NYHA-FC III-IV was the independent predictor of poor prognosis.",no,no,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,,0
2023-11-13,37946137,Leptospirosis-associated meningitis in a patient with sjögren's syndrome: a case report.,"Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease that afflicts both humans and animals. It progresses from flu-like symptoms to more severe hepatic and renal failure, and may also lead to aseptic meningitis. Individuals with autoimmune diseases (ADs) are potentially more susceptible to Leptospirosis. Thus far, limited data has documented the association between Leptospirosis and autoimmune disorders.The patient had a definitive pathological diagnosis of Sjögren's syndrome (SS). Due to recurrent headaches, the patient sought consultation with a neurologist. Lumbar puncture revealed elevated white blood cells and protein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid, along with decreased glucose. Tuberculous meningitis was suspected. Radiographic imaging exhibited meningeal enhancement, ventricular enlargement, and hydrocephalus. The patient commenced treatment with anti-tuberculosis therapy and corticosteroids. Subsequently, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of cerebrospinal fluid identified the presence of Leptospira interrogans. The patient was ultimately diagnosed with Leptospiral meningitis, and underwent antimicrobial and immunosuppressive therapy, resulting in stabilization of the condition and gradual symptom recovery.The case highlights the challenges in diagnosing and managing leptospirosis-related meningitis in the presence of ADs and emphasizes the importance of utilizing HTS for accurate pathogen detection. The potential correlation between leptospirosis and SS warrants further investigation, as does the need for multidisciplinary involvement in treatment strategies for such complex cases.",no,no,no,other,,,,0

Cyanobacteria produce multiple toxins, including the potent hepatotoxic microcystins (MCs), that have been reported to cause illness in exposed persons worldwide. Widespread exposure to toxins released by blue-green algae during the 2018 bloom was shown by the presence of MCs in the nasal passages of 95 percent of the individuals studied previously in south Florida (Schaefer et al., 2020). The current analyses were conducted to determine whether self-reported symptoms were associated with activity patterns, direct contact with water, residential, recreational, and occupational exposure. The 125 persons who participated in the initial study reported an average of 4.94 (± 4.87) symptoms. Those reported most commonly included rhinorrhea, sneezing, headache, sore throat and dry cough. Respiratory symptoms were reported by 74%, ocular symptoms by 62%, and gastrointestinal symptoms by 35% of respondents. Residential and recreational exposures were associated with increased risks of respiratory, gastrointestinal, or ocular symptoms in univariate and adjusted multivariable analyses. Residential exposure was significantly associated with increased reporting of dry cough (p = 0.03), dyspnea (p < 0.01) and wheezy respirations (p = 0.04). Among persons reporting gastrointestinal symptoms, nausea (p = 0.02) and abdominal pain (p < 0.01) were significantly associated with residential exposure. Recreational exposure was significantly associated with sore throat and eye irritation.

The adrenocortical function has not been systematically investigated with a few anecdotal reports of overt adrenal insufficiency (AI). The study aimed to assess the adrenocortical function in a large cohort of SLSMDs.A retrospective monocentric longitudinal study involved a cohort of 18 SLSMDs patients. Adrenocortical function was evaluated by baseline adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol measurements and by high- (HDT) and low-dose (LDT) ACTH stimulation tests and compared with 92 healthy controls (HC).Baseline adrenocortical function was impaired in 39% of patients and by the end of the study, 66% of PS and 25% of KSS showed an insufficient increase after ACTH stimulation, with cortisol deficiency due to primary AI in most PS and subclinical AI in KSS. Symptomatic AI was recorded in 44% of patients. Peak cortisol levels after ACTH stimulation tests were significantly lower in patients than in HC (P < .0001), with a more reduced response to LDT vs HDT (P < .05).Our study highlights that cortisol deficiency due to primary AI represents a relevant part of the clinical spectrum in SLSMDs, with more severe impairment in PS than in KSS. Basal and after-stimulus assessment of adrenocortical axis should be early and regularly investigated to identify any degree of adrenocortical dysfunction. The study allowed the elaboration of a diagnostic process designed for the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of adrenocortical abnormalities in SLSMDs.",no,no,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,,0
2023-11-14,37848027,Combined inactivation of RB and Hippo converts differentiating Drosophila photoreceptors into eye progenitor cells through derepression of homothorax.,"The retinoblastoma (RB) and Hippo pathways interact to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. However, the mechanism of interaction is not fully understood. Drosophila photoreceptors with inactivated RB and Hippo pathways specify normally but fail to maintain their neuronal identity and dedifferentiate. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing to elucidate the cause of dedifferentiation and to determine the fate of these cells. We find that dedifferentiated cells adopt a progenitor-like fate due to inappropriate activation of the retinal differentiation suppressor homothorax (hth) by Yki/Sd. This results in the activation of a distinct Yki/Hth transcriptional program, driving photoreceptor dedifferentiation. We show that Rbf physically interacts with Yki and, together with the GAGA factor, inhibits the hth expression. Thus, RB and Hippo pathways cooperate to maintain photoreceptor differentiation by preventing inappropriate expression of hth in differentiating photoreceptors. Our work highlights the importance of both RB and Hippo pathway activities for maintaining the state of terminal differentiation.",no,no,no,in vitro,biomarker,,,0

Eighty-nine days later, the dog showed lethargy accompanied by hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia. Hypoadrenocorticism due to trilostane was suspected, but the result of the adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test was not conclusive. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound showed loss of adrenocortical blood flow in both adrenal glands, indicating adrenocortical hypoperfusion and isolated hypoadrenocorticism. Treatment with fludrocortisone acetate improved the condition and electrolyte abnormalities. Thirteen months later, the dog showed alopecia, and an adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test revealed increased cortisol concentration, indicating hypercortisolism recurrence. The dog died due to progressive deterioration 22 months after the initial presentation. Post-mortem examination revealed focally extensive necrosis with marked calcification in the parenchyma of the adrenal glands and regeneration of the cells in the zona fasciculata with severe fibrosis.

However, there is no direct evidence elucidating the relationship between low-intensity noise exposure and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Male mice (n = 5) on high-fat diet (HFD) were exposed to an average of 75 dB SPL noise for 3 months to reveal the effect of noise exposure on NAFLD, where the potential mechanisms were explored. In vivo (n = 5) and in vitro models challenged with dexamethasone (DEX) were used to verify the role of hypothalamus pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis activation in hepatic lipid metabolism. Typical chronic-restraint stress (CRS, n = 8) was used to explore the role of depression in modifying activity of HPA axis. Finally, animal experiment (n = 8) was repeated to validate the roles of depression and HPA axis activation in NAFLD development. Chronic low-intensity noise exposure exacerbated NAFLD in mice on HFD characterized by hepatocyte steatosis, modified lipid metabolism and inflammation level. Plasma ACTH in H + N group was 1.5-fold higher than that in HFD group. Transcription of glucocorticoid receptor target genes was increased by chronic low-intensity noise exposure in HFD-treated mice. Excessive glucocorticoids mimicking HPA axis activation induced NAFLD in vivo and in vitro. Plasma ACTH increase and lipid storage also occurred in depressive mice stressed by CRS. More interestingly, the same noise exposure simultaneously induced depression in mice, disrupted the HPA axis homeostasis and exacerbated NAFLD in a repeated experiment. Thus, three-month exposure to 75 dB SPL noise was sufficient to exacerbate NAFLD progress in mice, where activation of HPA axis played a critical role. Depression played an intermediate role and contributed to HPA axis activation up-stream of the exacerbation.",no,no,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,,0
2023-11-15,37776552,Ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) syndrome: two case reports.,"Clinically, the incidence of ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) syndrome (EAS) is often obscured, making it difficult to identify the primary lesion. This can pose challenges in both diagnosing and treating the disease. Therefore, this paper presents two cases of EAS to share insights and guide diagnosis and treatment approaches.Case 1 is a male patient aged 71, and Case 2 is a female patient aged 61. EAS was considered for both patients according to the medical history and auxiliary examination results. After the blood glucose and blood potassium were slightly stable, Case 1 received the total right adrenalectomy and the left subtotal adrenalectomy. After the surgery, a positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) was used to identify the primary lesion in Case 1, and the result showed primary neuroendocrine tumors originating from the thymus with metastasis. A chest CT scan with contrast for Case 2 confirmed the presence of multiple soft tissue nodules in both lungs, suspected of being tumor lesions, along with mediastinal lymph node enlargement. A CT-guided lung puncture was not performed due to a progressive decrease in platelets, and the patient died due to severe lung infection eventually.PET-CT can be an effective method for diagnosing EAS. Early control of hypercortisolism is vital in preventing life-threatening infections in EAS patients.",no,no,no,other,,,,0

Our understanding of the effects of PACs, excluding the 16 priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (16 PAHs), remains limited. Zebrafish embryos and in vitro bioassays were utilized to investigate the embryotoxic, behavioral, and molecular effects of a soil sample from a former gasworks site in Sweden. Additionally, targeted chemical analysis was conducted to analyze 87 PACs in the soil, fish, water, and plate material. CALUX® assays were used to assess the activation of aryl hydrocarbon and estrogen receptors, as well as the inhibition of the androgen receptor. Larval behavior was measured by analyzing activity during light and darkness and in response to mechanical stimulation. Furthermore, qPCR analyses were performed on a subset of 36 genes associated with specific adverse outcomes, and the total lipid content in the larvae was measured. Exposure to the sample resulted in embryotoxic effects (LC50 = 0.480 mg dry matter soil/mL water). The mixture also induced hyperactivity in darkness and hypoactivity in light and in response to the mechanical stimulus. qPCR analysis revealed differential regulation of 15 genes, including downregulation of opn1sw1 (eye pigmentation) and upregulation of fpgs (heart failure). The sample caused significant responses in three bioassays (ERα-, DR-, and PAH-CALUX), and the exposed larvae exhibited elevated lipid levels. Chemical analysis identified benzo[a]pyrene as the predominant compound in the soil and approximately half of the total PAC concentration was attributed to the 16 PAHs. This study highlights the value of combining in vitro and in vivo methods with chemical analysis to assess toxic mechanisms at specific targets and to elucidate the possible interactions between various pathways in an organism.

The main objective of the studies presented herein was to evaluate the efficacy, toxicity and pharmacokinetic profile of Photobac in animals (mice, rats and dogs) and submit these results to the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for its approval to initiate Phase I human clinical trials of glioblastoma, a deadly cancer disease with no long term cure. The photodynamic therapy (PDT) efficacy of Photobac was evaluated in mice subcutaneously implanted with U87 tumors, and in rats bearing C6 tumors implanted in brain. In both tumor types, the Photobac-PDT was quite effective. The long-term cure in rats was monitored by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histopathology analysis. A detailed pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetic study of Photobac was investigated in both non-GLP and GLP facilities at variable doses following the US FDA parameters. Safety Pharmacology studies suggest that there is no phototoxicity, cerebral or retinal toxicity with Photobac. No metabolites of Photobac were observed following incubation in rat, dog, mini-pig and human hepatocytes. Based on current biological data, Photobac-IND received the approval for Phase-I human clinical trials to treat Glioblastoma (brain cancer), which is currently underway at our institute.

We aimed to identify germline variants in high- and low- to moderate-penetrance melanoma risk genes in Brazilian patients with clinical criteria for familial melanoma syndrome. We selected patients with three or more melanomas or melanoma patients from families with three tumors (melanoma and pancreatic cancer) in first- or second-degree relatives. Genetic testing was performed with a nine-gene panel (ACD, BAP1, CDK4, CDKN2A, POT1, TERT, TERF2IP, MC1R, and MITF). In 36 patients, we identified 2 (5.6%) with germline pathogenic variants in CDKN2A and BAP1 and 4 (11.1%) with variants of uncertain significance in the high-penetrance genes. MC1R variants were found in 86.5%, and both red hair color variants and unknown risk variants were enriched in patients compared to a control group. The low frequency of germline pathogenic variants in the high-penetrance genes and the high prevalence of MC1R variants found in our cohort show the importance of the MC1R genotype in determining the risk of melanoma in the Brazilian melanoma-prone families.",no,no,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,,0

2023-11-16,37938844,NT-proBNP or Self-Reported Functional Capacity in Estimating Risk of Cardiovascular Events After Noncardiac Surgery.,"Nearly 16 million surgical procedures are conducted in North America yearly, and postoperative cardiovascular events are frequent. Guidelines suggest functional capacity or B-type natriuretic peptides (BNP) to guide perioperative management. Data comparing the performance of these approaches are scarce.To compare the addition of either N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) or self-reported functional capacity to clinical scores to estimate the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE).This cohort study included patients undergoing inpatient, elective, noncardiac surgery at 25 tertiary care hospitals in Europe between June 2017 and April 2020. Analysis was conducted in January 2023. Eligible patients were either aged 45 years or older with a Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) of 2 or higher or a National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, Risk Calculator for Myocardial Infarction and Cardiac (NSQIP MICA) above 1%, or they were aged 65 years or older and underwent intermediate or high-risk procedures.Preoperative NT-proBNP and the following self-reported measures of functional capacity were the exposures: (1) questionnaire-estimated metabolic equivalents (METs), (2) ability to climb 1 floor, and (3) level of regular physical activity.MACE was defined as a composite end point of in-hospital cardiovascular mortality, cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, stroke, and congestive heart failure requiring transfer to a higher unit of care.A total of 3731 eligible patients undergoing noncardiac surgery were analyzed; 3597 patients had complete data (1258 women [35.0%]; 1463 (40.7%) aged 75 years or older; 86 [2.4%] experienced a MACE). Discrimination of NT-proBNP or functional capacity measures added to clinical scores did not significantly differ (Area under the receiver operating curve: RCRI, age, and 4MET, 0.704; 95% CI, 0.646-0.763; RCRI, age, and 4MET plus floor climbing, 0.702; 95% CI, 0.645-0.760; RCRI, age, and 4MET plus physical activity, 0.724; 95% CI, 0.672-0.775; RCRI, age, and 4MET plus NT-proBNP, 0.736; 95% CI, 0.682-0.790). Benefit analysis favored NT-proBNP at a threshold of 5% or below, ie, if true positives were valued 20 times or more compared with false positives.

New tools are needed to improve precision of treatment by optimizing the balance between efficacy, safety, and cost. We developed a high-throughput multi-marker decision support instrument which simultaneously quantifies proteins associated with CVD.Candidate proteins independently associated with different clinical outcomes were selected from clinical studies by the screening of 368 circulating biomarkers. We then custom-designed a quantitative PEA-panel with 21 proteins (CVD-21) by including recombinant antigens as calibrator samples for normalization and absolute quantification of the proteins. The utility of the CVD-21 tool was evaluated in plasma samples from a case-control cohort of 4224 patients with chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) using multivariable Cox regression analyses and machine learning techniques. The assays in the CVD-21 tool gave good precision and high sensitivity with lower level of determination (LOD) between 0.03-0.7 pg/ml for five of the biomarkers. The dynamic range for the assays was sufficient to accurately quantify the biomarkers in the validation study except for troponin I, which in the modeling was replaced by high-sensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-TnT). We created seven different multimarker models, including a reference model with NT-proBNP, hs-TnT, GDF-15, IL-6, and cystatin C and one model with only clinical variables, for the comparison of the discriminative value of the CVD-21 tool. All models with biomarkers including hs-TnT provided similar discrimination for all outcomes, e.g. c-index between 0.68-0.86 and outperformed models using only clinical variables. Most important prognostic biomarkers were MMP-12, U-PAR, REN, VEGF-D, FGF-23, TFF3, ADM, and SCF.The CVD-21 tool is the very first instrument which with PEA simultaneously quantifies 21 proteins with associations to different CVD.

The patients were divided into 2 cohorts: (1) silent corticotroph (SC) for NFpitNETs with positive ACTH immunostaining and (2) non-SC NFpitNETs. Rates of local tumor control and the incidence of post-treatment pituitary and neurological dysfunction were documented. Factors associated with radiological and clinical outcomes were also analyzed.The cohort included 535 patients from 14 centers with 84 (15.7%) patients harboring silent corticotroph NFpitNETs (SCs). At last follow-up, local tumor progression occurred in 11.9% of patients in the SC compared with 8.1% of patients in the non-SC cohort (P = .27). No statistically significant difference was noted in new-onset hypopituitarism rates (10.7% vs 15.4%, P = .25) or visual deficits (3.6% vs 1.1%, P = .088) between the 2 cohorts at last follow-up. When controlling for residual tumor volume, maximum dose, and patient age and sex, positive ACTH immunostaining did not have a significant correlation with local tumor progression (hazard ratio = 1.69, 95% CI = 0.8-3.61, P = .17).In contemporary radiosurgical practice with a single fraction dose of 8-25 Gy (median 15 Gy), ACTH immunostaining in NFpitNETs did not appear to confer a significantly reduced rate of local tumor control after SRS.",no,no,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,,0
2023-11-17,35635573,Loss of the heterogeneous expression of flippase ATP11B leads to cerebral small vessel disease in a normotensive rat model.,"Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is the leading cause of vascular dementia, causes a quarter of strokes, and worsens stroke outcomes. The disease is characterised by patchy cerebral small vessel and white matter pathology, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This microvascular and tissue damage has been classically considered secondary to extrinsic factors, such as hypertension, but this fails to explain the patchy nature of the disease, the link to endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction even when hypertension is absent, and the increasing evidence of high heritability to SVD-related brain damage. We have previously shown the link between deletion of the phospholipase flippase Atp11b and EC dysfunction in an inbred hypertensive rat model with SVD-like pathology and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in ATP11B associated with human sporadic SVD. Here, we generated a novel normotensive transgenic rat model, where Atp11b is deleted, and show pathological, imaging and behavioural changes typical of those in human SVD, but that occur without hypertension. Atp11bKO rat brain and retinal small vessels show ECs with molecular and morphological changes of dysfunction, with myelin disruption in a patchy pattern around some but not all brain small vessels, similar to the human brain. We show that ATP11B/ATP11B is heterogeneously expressed in ECs in normal rat and human brain even in the same transverse section of the same blood vessel, suggesting variable effects of the loss of ATP11B on each vessel and an explanation for the patchy nature of the disease. This work highlights a link between inherent EC dysfunction and vulnerability to SVD white matter damage with a marked heterogeneity of ECs in vivo which modulates this response, occurring even in the absence of hypertension. These findings refocus our strategies for therapeutics away from antihypertensive (and vascular risk factor) control alone and towards ECs in the effort to provide alternative targets to prevent a major cause of stroke and dementia.",no,no,no,animal,biomarker,,,0
2023-11-17,36126108,Parapapillary gamma zone associated with increased peripapillary scleral bowing: the Beijing Eye Study 2011.,"To investigate the association between the backward configuration of the peripapillary sclera (PPS), measured as PPS angle (PPSA), and presence and extent of parapapillary gamma zone.Out of the population-based Beijing Eye Study 2011, we randomly selected individuals free of optic nerve and retinal diseases. With Spectralis optical coherence tomography, we measured gamma zone (zone free of Bruch's membrane (BM)) and determined the PPSA, defined as the angle between the anterior scleral surface lines from both sides of the optic nerve head (ONH).The study included 678 individuals with age of 59.5±7.6 years (range: 50-90) and axial length of 23.5±1.3 mm (20.9-29.2). Gamma zone was more prevalent in eyes with larger PPSA (p=0.006) after adjustment for axial length (p<0.001) and BM opening area (p<0.001). Gamma zone width was positively associated with PPSA, axial length and BM opening area (all p<0.001) in multivariable analysis. Circular gamma zone was accompanied with larger PPSA as compared with focal gamma zone (19.9°±7.2° vs 6.3°±5.3°, p<0.001). Focal temporal gamma and focal inferior gamma had similar mean PPSA (p=0.69). However, the horizontal PPSA was significantly larger than the vertical PPSA in inferior gamma (6.9°±6.3° vs 4.7°±6.6°; p=0.005), while they were comparable in temporal gamma (6.1°±5.8° vs 6.3°±6.4°; p=0.073).A more backward bowing of the PPS was linearly and spatially associated with the presence, size and extent of gamma zone. It suggested that the BM and the sclera were closely related in participating the biomechanical behaviour of the ONH.",no,no,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,,0
2023-11-17,36351552,Evaluation of the Optic Nerve Head Using Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography in Systemic Sclerosis Patients.,"To quantify microvascular vessel density in the optic disc using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) in patients with systemic sclerosis (SS); to determine whether there is a difference in values between patients and controls; and to correlate the OCTA measurements with disease activity, damage risk, and drug usage.Patients aged 20 - 76 years who were followed up after a diagnosis of SS and age- and gender-matched controls. The patients underwent RTVue-XR AngioVue OCTA imaging in this cross-sectional observational study.A total of 61 eyes of 61 consecutive SS patients and 60 eyes of 60 controls were investigated. There was no statistically significant difference between the patients and control groups regarding the average RNFL (retinal fiber layer) and radial peripapillary capillary (RPC) vessel density (VD) measurements (p = 0.35, p = 0.25, respectively). As the antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer increased, RNFLsuperior (p = 0.01, r = - 0.327), RPCwhole (p = 0.029, r = 0.279), RPCperipapillary (p = 0.037, r = - 0.267), RPCsuperior (p = 0.003, r = - 0.371), and RPCinferior (p = 0.02, r = 0.297) values decreased with statistical significance. The RPCinside values were lower in anti-Scl-70-positive patients compared to patients negative for anti-Scl-70 (topoisomerase I) (p = 0.021). The RNFLnasal (p = 0.03, r = - 0.278) value decreased as the years of disease increased. The RPCinside value was higher in patients using hydroxychloroquine and calcium channel blockers than those who did not use them (p = 0.021 and p = 0.027, respectively). The RPCwhole, RPCperipapillary, and RPCnasal values were higher, with statistical significance in corticosteroid users than in those patients who did not use corticosteroids (p = 0.043, 0.030, and 0.033, respectively).There was no significant difference between the patients and control groups regarding the average RPC VD measurements. However, since this is the first study to analyze optic disc vessel density in SS patients, optic nerve blood flow changes in scleroderma with OCTA could be studied.",no,no,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,,0
2023-11-17,37736855,Alterations in neuroendocrine axes in brain-dead patients.,"To identify changes in anterior pituitary gland hormone levels in brain-dead patients and alterations in free triiodothyronine (fT3), free thyroxine, cortisol, testosterone, and estradiol levels.Ten postmenopausal women and 22 men with brain death (BD) were included. The first blood sample for determination of hormones (pre-BD) was collected when the clinician observed the first signs of BD. The second blood sample (BD day) was drawn after BD certification.Female patients exhibited lower follicle-stimulating hormone and prolactin levels pre-BD and luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and prolactin levels on BD day than the age-matched controls. Male patients' sex hormone levels were similar to those of the age-matched controls, except for testosterone levels, which were low in both consecutive measurements. All gonadotropins and prolactin levels were above the tests' lower detection limits (LDLs), except for one male patient with gonadotropin levels below the LDLs of the tests. Estradiol levels in both sexes ranged from normal to elevated. FT3 levels were significantly decreased in the two measurements. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were low in eight patients and all low TSH levels were above the test's LDL. The remaining patients had normal or elevated TSH levels. The median adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol levels were within normal limits. All cortisol and ACTH levels were above the tests' LDLs, except for one patient with ACTH levels below the LDL in both measurements.This study supports the hypothesis that the anterior pituitary gland continues to function in the brain-dead state.",no,no,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,,0
2023-11-17,37751679,Predictors for future development of systemic lupus erythematosus in Korean Sjögren's syndrome patients.,"This study determined the impact of demographic factors, clinical manifestations, disease activity, and serological tests at baseline on future SLE development in Sjögren's syndrome (SS) patients.This retrospective study assessed 1,082 SS patients without other autoimmune diseases at baseline who visited our hospital between January 2012 and March 2021. We analyzed demographic features, extra-glandular manifestations (EGMs), clinical indices, and laboratory values at baseline between the two groups divided per future SLE development (SS/SLE group vs SS group). The probability and predictors of SLE development in SS patients were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards models.The median follow-up duration was 1083.5 days. Forty-nine patients (4.5%) developed SLE that met the 2012 Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics or 2019 EULAR/ACR classification criteria. The baseline EULAR SS disease activity index (ESSDAI) score was significantly higher in the SS/SLE group (p < .001). The SS/SLE group had more lymphadenopathy and renal involvement (p = .015 and p = .017, respectively). Shorter SS disease duration (<3 years) (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.12, p = .0328), high ESSDAI (HR = 8.24, p < .0001), leukopenia (HR = 4.17, p = .0005), thrombocytopenia (HR = 3.38, p = .0059), hypocomplementemia (HR = 29.06, p<.0001), and positive for anti-dsDNA (HR = 13.70, p < .0001), anti-ribonucleoprotein (RNP) (HR = 3.82, p = .0027), and anti-ribosomal P (HR = 6.70, p = .0002) at baseline were SLE development predictors in SS patients.Shorter disease duration and higher disease activity of SS at baseline may be risk factors for future SLE development. Serologic predictors of SLE development are hypocomplementemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and positivity for anti-dsDNA, anti-RNP, and anti-ribosomal P antibodies. If the above factors are observed, close monitoring will be necessary during the follow-up period, considering the possibility of future SLE development.",no,no,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,,0

It is not clear whether microangiopathy, such as fundus arteriosclerosis, is related to carotid atherosclerosis. Hence, this study was designed to investigate the relationship between carotid atherosclerosis and fundus arteriosclerosis among individuals of different sexes in the Chinese health-examination population.This retrospective cross-sectional study involved 20,836 participants, including 13050 males and 7786 females. All participants underwent a detailed health examination, including medical history assessment, physical examination, assessment of lifestyle factors, fundus photography, Doppler ultrasound examination of the neck, and laboratory examinations. Two trained ophthalmologists analysed fundus arteriosclerosis based on fundus photographs, while carotid atherosclerosis was diagnosed using colour Doppler sonography of the neck. Binary logistic regression was used to analyse the relationship between carotid atherosclerosis and fundus arteriosclerosis.In participants with fundus arteriosclerosis, the incidence of carotid atherosclerosis was higher than that of participants without fundus arteriosclerosis (52.94% vs. 47.06%). After adjustments for potential confounding factors, fundus arteriosclerosis was significantly associated with the risk of carotid atherosclerosis. The OR with 95% CI for fundus arteriosclerosis was 1.17 (1.02, 1.34) with p = 0.0262, and individuals who did not have fundus arteriosclerosis were used as a reference in the total population. Fundus arteriosclerosis was associated with the incidence of carotid atherosclerosis in males (p = 0.0005) but not in females (p = 0.0746).Fundus arteriosclerosis was closely associated with carotid atherosclerosis in the Chinese population. This association was found in males but not in females.",no,no,no,human non-RCT,effectiveness,,,0
2023-11-17,37968952,[Corticotropin-producing pheochromocytoma in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1].,"A clinical case of a man 66 y.o. who was diagnosed with hormone-inactive pituitary macroadenoma complicated by corneal erosion and partial atrophy of the optic nerve of the left eye due to exophthalmos. The increase in prolactin level was regarded due to a «stalk-effect». The patient underwent a transnasal pituitary adenomectomy with subsequent regression of symptoms. After 4 years, against the background of a new coronavirus infection, increasing general weakness, headaches, a crisis increase in blood pressure and tachycardia attacks appeared. Computed tomography (CT) accidentally revealed an adrenal incidentaloma, in laboratory tests - hypercortisolism, elevated ACTH levels, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, increased levels of metanephrine and normetanephrine. The patient developed acute steroid psychosis, after which an adrenalectomy with a tumor was performed, a pheochromocytoma was histologically confirmed. After surgery, there was a regression of symptoms, the development of adrenal insufficiency with reduced levels of ACTH and cortisol. Upon further examination, a polynodose euthyroid goiter was established, the biopsy of the nodes - Hashimoto's thyroiditis (Bethesda II). Meanwhile, primary hyperparathyroidism was detected. According to ultrasound, scintigraphy with Ts99m-Technetril and CT revealed an increase of left parathyroid gland. A bilateral revision of the neck, removal of the right upper and left upper parathyroid adenomas were performed. In the postoperative period, the levels of calcium and parathyroid hormone were normalized. Given the presence of a combination of multiple tumors of the endocrine system (primary hyperparathyroidism, corticotropin-producing pheochromocytoma, hormone-inactive pituitary macroadenoma, polynodose euthyroid goiter), the MEN1 syndrome was clinically established. The study of 2 and 10 exons of the MEN1 gene revealed no mutations, which does not exclude the presence of a hereditary syndrome. The patient continues observation. In the available literature in Russian and English languages the case of ACTH pheochromocytoma as part of the MEN type 1 syndrome have not been found.

2023-11-21,37882246,"Effects of phenylbutazone, firocoxib, and dipyrone on the diuretic response to furosemide in horses.","Treatment with phenylbutazone (nonselective COX inhibitor) decreases the diuretic and natriuretic effects of furosemide by nearly 30% but the effects of COX-2 specific inhibitors (firocoxib) and atypical NSAIDs (dipyrone) are unknown.Furosemide-induced diuresis after pretreatment with firocoxib or dipyrone is diminished to a lesser extent than after pretreatment with phenylbutazone.Eight healthy mares.Each mare received 4 treatments in a prospective experimental crossover study using a replicated 4 × 4 Latin Square design: furosemide alone (FU), furosemide and phenylbutazone (PB), furosemide and firocoxib (FX), and furosemide and dipyrone (DP). After 24 hours of NSAID treatment at recommended dosages, ureteral catheters were placed for continual urine collection. After a 30-minute baseline collection period, furosemide (1.0 mg/kg, IV) was administered, and urine and blood samples were collected for 4 hours. Data were assessed by repeated measures ANOVA.Four-hour urine volume was (mean ± SD) ~25% less (P < .001) after pretreatment with all NSAIDs (PB 19.1 ± 2.1 mL/kg, FX 17.7 ± 3.5 mL/kg, DP 19.1 ± 3.9 mL/kg), as compared to FU (23.4 ± 5.1 mL/kg) (P < .001), but there were no differences between PB, FX, or DP. Interindividual variability in furosemide diuresis after pretreatment with different NSAIDs was observed.Though COX-2 selective NSAIDs and dipyrone might have less severe or fever gastrointestinal adverse effects in horses, our data suggest minimal differences in effects on furosemide-induced diuresis, and possibly, risk of nephrotoxicosis.",no,no,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety",,,0

Herein, we explored the daytime glucose profile of children with classical CAH.We conducted an observational study in 11 children (6 female; age 3.1 years [1.4, 5.1]; body mass index 17.3 kg/m2 [15.6, 17.9]) with a genetic diagnosis of classical CAH receiving hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone replacement therapy. Participants underwent 2 14-day continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sessions and an inpatient 24 h series cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) measures. Data were analyzed for 3 daytime lags (7 Am-4 Pm, 4 Pm-10pm, 10 Pm-7 Am) corresponding to the hydrocortisone dosing period with cortisol and ACTH measured before the hydrocortisone dose.Eleven participants completed at least 1 CGM session, and 7 out of 11 underwent both the CGM session and the cortisol/ACTH serial measures. In the whole cohort, the percentage of time of sensor glucose values <70 mg/dL was higher during the 10 Pm-7 Am and the 7 Am-4 Pm time slots than in the late afternoon period (17% [7, 54] and 15% [6.8, 24] vs 2% [1.1, 16.7] during the periods 7 Am-4 Pm and 4 Pm-10 Pm, respectively [P = .006 and P = .003]). Nighttime hypoglycemia was mostly spent below the 65 mg/dL (10.9% [4.1, 34]). The glycemic pattern paralleled the nadir of daily cortisol at 7 Am (10.3±4.4 μg/dL). A greater percentage of time in hypoglycemia was associated with lower cortisol concentration at 7 Am and 10 Pm (P < .001 and P = .005).Continuous glucose monitoring demonstrated a disrupted daily glucose pattern in children with CAH, paralleled by a lower cortisol concentration.NCT04322435.",no,no,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,,0
2023-11-21,37981759,Small for gestational age at preterm birth identifies adverse neonatal outcomes more reliably than antenatal suspicion of fetal growth restriction.,"Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is an important reason for premature delivery and a leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. We aimed to evaluate whether classification as small for gestational age (SGA; <10th centile) at birth or antenatal suspicion of FGR was more strongly associated with neonatal morbidity and mortality in preterm infants.A retrospective audit of infants born between 24 + 0 and 32 + 6 weeks of gestation from 2012-2019 and admitted to the Neonatal Unit at Mercy Hospital for Women (MHW). Infants were categorized according to whether FGR was listed as an antenatal complication in the medical records and whether they were SGA (<10th centile on Fenton chart) or appropriate for gestational age (AGA) at birth, and comparisons for neonatal outcomes were made.371/2126 preterm infants (17.5%) had antenatal suspicion of FGR, and 166 (7.8%) were SGA at birth. No differences in any neonatal outcomes were found between infants with or without suspected FGR, except decreased intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in the FGR group. SGA classification was associated with increased rates of all morbidities other than IVH, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, and necrotizing enterocolitis, compared with the AGA group. Death was significantly higher in the SGA group (7.2%) compared with the AGA group (3.5%).SGA by Fenton chart more reliably identified neonates at risk of adverse neonatal outcomes than antenatal suspicion of FGR, suggesting it is a reasonable clinical proxy. This most likely reflects the much lower tenth centile weight cutoffs on the Fenton charts compared to in-utero charts used antenatally to diagnose FGR based on ultrasound estimated fetal weight. SGA classification by Fenton approximately equates to <3rd centile on in-utero charts at our institution, therefore identifying the most severe FGR cases.",no,no,no,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety",,,0

We aimed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of washed microbiota transplantation (WMT), a new method of FMT, for CDI across various medical settings.This multicenter real-world cohort study included CDI patients undergoing WMT. The primary outcome was the clinical cure rate of CDI within 8 weeks after WMT. Secondary outcomes included the CDI recurrence rate and reduction in total abdominal symptom score (TASS) during the follow-up period. Adverse events related to WMT were recorded.Altogether 90.7% (49/54) of CDI patients achieved clinical cure after treated with WMT. The cure rate was 83.3% for cases with severe and complicated CDI (ScCDI) (n = 30) and 100% for non-ScCDI cases (n = 24) (P = 0.059). No difference was observed in the clinical cure rate between patients with first and recurrent CDI (91.9% vs 88.2%, P = 0.645). One week post-WMT, TASS showed a remarkable decrease compared to that at baseline (P < 0.001). Totally, 8.2% (4/49) of patients suffered CDI recurrence during the follow-up period. A WHO performance score of 4, age ≥65 years, higher TASS score, and higher Charlson comorbidity index score were potential risk factors for efficacy (P = 0.018, 0.03, 0.01, 0.034, respectively). Four (3.8%) transient adverse events related to WMT were observed.This study emphasizes the attractive value of WMT for CDI.

Here, we generated a human cone photoreceptor reporter line by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing of WTC11-mTagRFPT-LMNB1 human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by inserting enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) coding sequences and a 2A self-cleaving peptide at the N-terminus of guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit alpha transducin 2 (GNAT2). In retinal organoids generated from these iPSCs, the GNAT2-EGFP alleles robustly and exclusively labeled immature and mature cones. Episodic confocal live imaging of hydrogel immobilized retinal organoids allowed tracking of the morphological maturation of individual cones for >18 weeks and revealed inner segment accumulation of mitochondria and growth at 12.2 μm3 per day from day 126 to day 153.

2023-11-22,37983536,High prevalence of vertebral fractures associated with preoperative cortisol levels in patients with recent diagnosis of Cushing disease.,"Morphometric vertebral fractures (VFs) and osteopathy are prevalent and clinically significant complications of Cushing disease (CD). However whether they represent an early occurrence in the natural progression of the disease is an ongoing debate. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and determinants of VFs in patients newly diagnosed with CD.This cross-sectional case-control study recruited 75 newly diagnosed CD patients and compared them with a control group of individuals without pituitary disorders or secondary forms of osteoporosis. Demographic, clinical and biochemical data were collected. The VFs were assessed using preoperative lateral chest radiography.We found a significantly higher prevalence of VFs in the CD group than in the control group (58.7% vs. 14.5%; P < 0.001). Among the CD patients with VFs, 27 (61.4%) showed moderate/severe VFs. The CD patients with VFs had significantly higher preoperative 8 am serum cortisol (8ASC) levels than those without VFs (P < 0.001). The preoperative 4 pm adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels (P = 0.031), preoperative 0 am ACTH levels (P = 0.021) and systolic blood pressure were slightly higher in CD patients with VFs than in those without VFs (P = 0.028). A binary multiple logistic analysis showed that 8ASC was an independent predictor of VF risk (P = 0.003). The optimal cut-off value of the preoperative serum 8ASC level for predicting VFs was 22.18 ng/mL.This is the first study reporting a high prevalence of radiologic VFs in recently diagnosed CD patients. VFs may represent an early manifestation of CD and may be related to cortisol levels. Therefore, VF assessment should be included in the workup during CD diagnosis.",no,no,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,,0
2023-11-23,37656413,Effects of Compound Danshen Dripping Pills on Ventricular Remodeling and Cardiac Function after Acute Anterior Wall ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (CODE-AAMI): Protocol for a Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial.,"Ventricular remodeling after acute anterior wall ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (AAMI) is an important factor in occurrence of heart failure which additionally results in poor prognosis. Therefore, the treatment of ventricular remodeling needs to be further optimized. Compound Danshen Dripping Pills (CDDP), a traditional Chinese medicine, exerts a protective effect on microcirculatory disturbance caused by ischemia-reperfusion injury and attenuates ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction.This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CDDP in improving ventricular remodeling and cardiac function after AAMI on a larger scale.This study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial. The total of 268 patients with AAMI after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) will be randomly assigned 1:1 to the CDDP group (n=134) and control group (n=134) with a follow-up of 48 weeks. Both groups will be treated with standard therapy of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), with the CDDP group administrating 20 tablets of CDDP before pPCI and 10 tablets 3 times daily after pPCI, and the control group treated with a placebo simultaneously. The primary endpoint is 48-week echocardiographic outcomes including left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVI), and left ventricular end-systolic volume index (LVESVI). The secondary endpoint includes the change in N terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level, arrhythmias, and cardiovascular events (death, cardiac arrest, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, rehospitalization due to heart failure or angina pectoris, deterioration of cardiac function, and stroke).

2023-11-23,37703186,Dietary flavonoid myricetin 3-,"Melanogenesis is the process where skin pigment melanin is produced through tyrosinase activity. Overproduction of melanin causes skin disorders such as freckles, spots, and hyperpigmentation. Myricetin 3-O-galactoside (M3G) is a dietary flavonoid with reported bioactivities. M3G was isolated from Limonium tetragonum and its anti-melanogenic properties were investigated in α-melanocyte stimulating hormone-stimulated B16F10 melanoma cells. The in vitro anti-melanogenic capacity of M3G was confirmed by inhibited tyrosinase and melanin production. M3G-mediated suppression of melanogenic proteins, tyrosinase, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), and tyrosinase-related proteins (TRP)-1 and TRP-2, were confirmed by mRNA and protein levels, analyzed by RT-qPCR and Western blot, respectively. Furthermore, M3G suppressed Wnt signaling through the inhibition of PKA phosphorylation. M3G also suppressed the consequent phosphorylation of CREB and nuclear levels of MITF. Analysis of MAPK activation further revealed that M3G increased the activation of ERK1/2 while p38 and JNK activation remained unaffected. Results showed that M3G suppressed melanogenesis in B16F10 cells by decreasing tyrosinase production and therefore inhibiting melanin formation. A possible action mechanism was the suppression of CREB activation and upregulation of ERK phosphorylation which might cause the decreased nuclear levels of MITF. In conclusion, M3G was suggested to be a potential nutraceutical with anti-melanogenic properties.",no,no,no,in vitro,"effectiveness, biomarker",,,0
2023-11-23,37988664,Germline PRKACA amplification-associated primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease: a case report and literature review.,"Primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD) is a rare adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH)-independent Cushing's syndrome (CS). Pediatric patients with PPNAD typically have unusual skin lesions and slow growth with unknown causes. We present a case of a female Chinese patient with PPNAD caused by the germline PRKACA gene copy number gain of chromosome 19. The patient initially presented with kidney stones, short stature, and obesity. After further testing, it was discovered that the patient had diabetes, mild hypertension, low bone mass, a low ACTH level, and hypercortisolemia, and neither the low-dose or high-dose dexamethasone suppression test was able to inhibit hematuric cortisol, which paradoxically increased. PPNAD was pathologically diagnosed after unilateral adrenalectomy. Chromosome microarrays and whole exon sequencing analyses of the peripheral blood, as well as testing of sectioned adrenal tissue, showed a rise in the copy number of the duplication-containing PRKACA gene on chromosome 19p13.13p13.12, a de novo but not heritable gene defect that causes disease. The clinical signs and symptoms supported the diagnosis of Carney complex (CNC). One significant mechanism of CNC pathogenesis may be the rise in germline PRKACA copy number of chromosome 19. When assessing PPNAD patients for CNC, the possibility of PRKACA gene amplification should be considered. The effect of PRKACA gene amplification on the clinical manifestations of CNC needs to be confirmed by more cases.",no,no,no,other,,,,0

Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is the second most common rheumatic illnesses after rheumatoid arthritis with a female predominance. At present, the research on sexual health of female SS patients is still scarce and difficult to summarize.The objective of our study was to systematically review the literature for the influence of maternal SS on sexual health, such as sexual function, sex hormones, fertility, and pregnancy outcomes.We performed a comprehensive literature search based on PubMed and Web of science databases from inception to 1 November 2022. Outcomes were divided into 4 categories: sex hormones, sexual function, fertility, and pregnancy and offspring outcomes.A total of 756 potentially eligible papers were retrieved. After eliminating duplicate articles and reviewing the titles and abstracts to exclude records, we read the remaining 92 articles in full for further evaluation, and selected 42 studies. Results on sex hormones, sexual function, fertility and pregnancy and offspring outcomes were reported in 13, 12, 3 and 14 SS-related articles, respectively. The levels of some sex hormones in SS patients may have undergone changes. Female patients with SS have a high prevalence of sexual dysfunction compared with controls. Most studies suggested SS had an adverse impact on maternal and fetal outcomes following pregnancy. However, there is insufficient evidence that directly indicating the fertility of SS women is diminished.In summary, certain aspects of sexual health (sexual function, sex hormones and pregnancy outcomes) are impaired in SS women. Screening for sexual health problems in SS female should become an integral part of medical clinical practice. Rheumatologists should be aware of this association and collaborate with gynecologists, obstetricians, psychologists, and other experts on this issue to determine appropriate therapeutic approaches.",no,no,yes,other,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,,0
2023-11-24,37879455,Sex-dependent effect of inflammatory pain on negative affective states is prevented by kappa opioid receptors blockade in the nucleus accumbens shell.,"Pain comorbidities include several psychological disorders, such as anxiety and anhedonia. However, the way pain affects male and female individuals and by which mechanism is not well understood. Previous research shows that pain induces alterations in the dynorphinergic pathway within the mesocorticolimbic system (MCLS), together with a relationship between corticotropin-releasing system and dynorphin release in the MCLS. Here, we analyse the sex and time course-dependent effects of pain on negative affect. Additionally, we study the implication of dynorphinergic and corticotropin releasing factor in these pain related behaviours. We used behavioural pharmacology and biochemical tools to characterise negative affective states induced by inflammatory pain in male and female rats, and the alterations in the dynorphinergic and the corticotropin systems within the MCLS. Female rats showed persistent anxiety-like and reversible anhedonia-like behaviours derived from inflammatory pain. Additionally, we found alterations in dynorphin and corticotropin releasing factor in NAc and amygdala, which suggests sex-dependent dynamic adaptations. Finally blockade on the kappa opioid receptor in the NAc confirmed its role in pain-induced anxiety-like behaviour in female rats. Our results show sex and time-dependent anxiety- and anhedonia-like behaviours induced by the presence of pain in female rats. Furthermore, we replicated previous data, pointing to the KOR/DYN recruitment in the NAc as a key neurological substrate mediating pain-induced behavioural alterations. This research studies the mechanisms underlying these behaviours, to better understand the emotional dimension of pain.",no,no,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,,0

The investigational medicinal product is being developed for treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI). This adaptive dose escalation study evaluated the tolerability, safety and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic activity of KCL-286 in male healthy volunteers to establish dosing to be used in the SCI patient population.The design was a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled dose escalation study in 2 parts: a single ascending dose adaptive design with a food interaction arm, and a multiple ascending dose design. RARβ2 mRNA expression was evaluated in white blood cells.At the highest single and multiple ascending doses (100 mg), no trends or clinically important differences were noted in the incidence or intensity of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs or other safety assessments with none leading to withdrawal from the study. The AEs were dry skin, rash, skin exfoliation, raised liver enzymes and eye disorders. There was an increase in mean maximum observed concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve up to 24 h showing a trend to subproportionality with dose. RARβ2 was upregulated by the investigational medicinal product in white blood cells.KCL-286 was well tolerated by healthy human participants following doses that exceeded potentially clinically relevant plasma exposures based on preclinical in vivo models. Target engagement shows the drug candidate activates its receptor.

Then, the toric axis was directly reviewed using the slit-lamp under full mydriasis. Axis measurement differences between each of the 2 devices and the slit-lamp, described as their relative differences (RDs), were calculated and compared. The percentage of RDs within 5 degrees, within 10 degrees and greater than 30 degrees were analyzed.77 eyes of 70 patients were included. Generally, the mean toric axis measurement RDs of CASIA2 and iTrace were 9.24 ± 10.53 degrees and 13.89 ± 15.47 degrees respectively ( P = .04). For CASIA2 (72 eyes), 54.17% (39), 72.22% (52), and 4.17% (3) of eyes had RDs within 5 degrees, within 10 degrees and greater than 30 degrees, compared with 40.00% (28), 61.43% (43) and 12.86% (9) for iTrace (70 eyes). The 95% limits of agreements of CASIA2 with slit-lamp was narrower than that of iTrace with slit-lamp. The median RD of CASIA2 was significantly smaller in eyes with pupil ≥4 mm under dark condition compared with eyes with pupil <4 mm ( P = .03).CASIA2 demonstrates greater precision in measuring toric IOL orientation under non-mydriatic conditions compared with iTrace.

2023-11-27,37726450,Heterogeneity of TPIT expression in ACTH-secreting extra-pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) supports the existence of different cellular programs in pancreatic and pulmonary NETs.,"Extra-pituitary ACTH secretion is associated with a variety of neoplastic conditions and may cause the so-called ectopic ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome (CS). The clarification of the mechanisms of extra-pituitary ACTH expression would provide potential therapeutic targets for this complex and severe disease. In the adenohypophysis, the transcription factor TPIT, co-operating with other molecules, induces POMC expression and ACTH production. However, no data are currently available on the presence and role of TPIT expression in extra-pituitary ACTH-producing neoplasms. This study was designed to explore TPIT expression in a series of pulmonary and pancreatic ACTH-producing tumors, either CS-associated or not. Forty-one extra-pituitary ACTH-producing neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) were included in the study, encompassing 32 NETs of the lung (LuNETs), 7 of the pancreas (PanNETs), and 2 pheochromocytomas. Of these, 9 LuNETs, all PanNETs, and the two pheochromocytomas were CS-associated. For comparison, 6 NETs of the pituitary gland (PitNETs; 3 ACTH-secreting and 3 ACTH-negative) and 35 ACTH-negative extra-pituitary NETs (15 Lu-NETs and 20 PanNETs) were analyzed. Immunohistochemistry with specific anti-TPIT antibodies and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) were performed using standard protocols. TPIT expression was completely absent (protein and mRNA) in PanNETs, pheochromocytomas, and all ACTH-negative NETs. In contrast, it was expressed in 16/32 LuNETs, although with lower levels than in PitNETs. No definite relationship was found between immunohistochemistry TPIT expression and NET grade or the presence of Cushing syndrome. This study further highlights the clinical and biological heterogeneity of extra-pituitary ACTH secretion and suggests that the differences between ACTH-secreting PanNETs and LuNETs may mirror distinct molecular mechanisms underlying POMC expression. Our results point towards the recognition of a real corticotroph-like phenotype of ACTH-producing LuNETs, that is not a feature of ACTH-producing PanNETs.",no,no,no,human non-RCT,biomarker,,,0
2023-11-27,37769886,The regulatory effect of Angelicae Sinensis Radix on neuroendocrine-immune network and sphingolipid metabolism in CUMS-induced model of depression.,"Conventional antidepressants therapy remains unsatisfactory due to the disadvantages of delayed clinical onset of action and side effects. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) with good efficacy and higher safety have received much attention. Angelicae Sinensis Radix (AS), a well-known TCM, has been proved to exhibit the efficacy of antidepression recently.The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential anti-depressant mechanisms of AS based on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) rat model.In this study, behavioral experiments, molecular biology techniques, and ultra performance liquid chromatography-triple-time of flight mass spectrometer (UPLC-Triple-TOF/MS) were combined to explore the potential antidepressant mechanisms of AS based on CUMS rat model.The results demonstrated that AS could reduce the contents of serum hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hormones in CUMS rats, including corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol (CORT). In addition, AS regulated the percentage of CD4+ T lymphocytes, the ratio of CD4+/CD8+, and the levels of serum cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, and TNF-α in CUMS rats. Lipidomics showed that 31 lipids were related to depression and AS could regulate the lipid metabolism alteration induced by CUMS, particularly sphingolipid metabolism. Finally, the key proteins in sphingolipid metabolic pathways in hippocampus of CUMS rats could be back-regulated by AS, including serine palmitoyl transferase (SPTLC2), ceramide synthase (CerS2), sphingomyelinase (SPHK1), and neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase).AS could alleviate NEI network disorder and restore the levels of sphingolipid metabolites and key proteins in CUMS rats. The underlying mechanism by which AS relieved depression-like behavior in CUMS rats may be through modulation of NEI and disturbances in sphingolipid metabolism.",no,no,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,,0
2023-11-27,37902624,Short-term Changes in Epithelial and Optical Redistribution Induced by Different Orthokeratology Designs.,"This study aimed to investigate corneal epithelial and topographic changes caused by two commercial myopia orthokeratology (ortho-k) designs.Twenty-six subjects fitted with vision shape treatment (VST) lenses and 30 subjects fitted with corneal reshaping therapy (CRT) lenses were reviewed 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month after lens initiation. A spectral-domain optical coherence tomography system was used to create epithelial maps that were in turn used to determine the average epithelial thickness of each zone and the diameter of treatment zone. By measuring the topographic tangential differential map, the treatment zone diameter and the power and width of the high convex zone (HCZ) were obtained. All epithelial thicknesses and topographic corneal variations recorded were analyzed.At the central zone, the epithelial thickness changes (△ET) decreased significantly after 1 day of ortho-k in two groups. At 2- to 9-mm peripheral zone, ortho-k increased △ET until 1 week in the VST group, whereas it kept increasing in the CRT group after 1 week. At 1 month, the central △ET is -9.51±2.38 mm in the VST group, which was comparable to -8.72±3.43 mm in the CRT group. The nasal HCZ power and the △ET of nasal and inferior nasal were significantly larger in the CRT group. A positive correlation was found between the HCZ power and △ET generated by VST-type lenses inferiorly and temporally. For the CRT group, a positive correlation was found between inferior HCZ power and △ET.At the early stage of ortho-k, epithelial thickness and topography change quickly and simultaneously. Epithelial changes were in line with corneal topography reshaping. Epithelial and optical remodelling were affected by different lens types.",no,no,no,human non-RCT,effectiveness,,,0
2023-11-27,37924815,Generation of glucocorticoid-producing cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells.,"Adrenal insufficiency is a life-threatening condition resulting from the inability to produce adrenal hormones in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Establishing a cell-based therapy would provide a physiologically responsive approach for the treatment of this condition. We report the generation of large numbers of human-induced steroidogenic cells (hiSCs) from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). Directed differentiation of hPSCs into hiSCs recapitulates the initial stages of human adrenal development. Following expression of steroidogenic factor 1, activation of protein kinase A signaling drives a steroidogenic gene expression profile most comparable to human fetal adrenal cells, and leads to dynamic secretion of steroid hormones, in vitro. Moreover, expression of the adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) receptor/co-receptor (MC2R/MRAP) results in dose-dependent ACTH responsiveness. This protocol recapitulates adrenal insufficiency resulting from loss-of-function mutations in AAAS, which cause the enigmatic triple A syndrome.

The baseline data of patients were observed, and the positive rates of LAAT formation by ECG, CTA, and TEE were compared. The efficacy of combined ECG and CTA in the diagnosis of LAAT was also evaluated.Among the 80 NVAF patients, 23 were LAAT positive and 57 were LAAT negative. There were statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of age, body mass index (BMI), N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide NT-probNP, fibrinogen, CHA2DS2-VASC [congestive Heart Failure, Hypertension, Age (75 or older), diabetes mellitus, stroke, vascular disease, age (65-74), sex category] score, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, renal insufficiency, D-dimer, heart failure, and serum uric acid (p<0.05). The positive rate of LAAT detected by ECG combined with CTA was closest to the gold standard TEE, but the difference was not statistically significant (p>0.05). Statistically significant differences were found between LAAT positive and negative patients in various parameters related to left atrial and left ventricular dimensions and function (p<0.05), while some parameters showed no significant differences (p>0.05).ECG combined with CTA has a high diagnostic value for LAAT formation in NVAF patients, with a high degree of confidence and reduced patient intolerance.

2023-11-27,37981765,[Analysis of adverse neonatal outcomes in pregnant women with positive anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies].,"Objective: To investigate the relationship between positive anti-Ro/Sjögren syndrome antigen type A (SSA) antibody and anti-La/Sjögren syndrome antigen type B (SSB) antibody in pregnant women and neonatal adverse outcomes. Methods: This study was a retrospective study, and 145 deliveries of 136 anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibody positive pregnant women were selected who had prenatal examination and delivered in Peking University First Hospital from January 2017 to June 2022. According to whether adverse neonatal outcomes occurred, 145 deliveries were divided into adverse outcome group (26 cases) and no adverse outcome group (119 cases). According to the time when anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies were found positive, 145 deliveries were divided into the antibody positive during pregnancy group (69 cases) and the pre-pregnancy antibody positive group (76 cases). The pregnancy outcomes, treatment and maternal and infant antibody levels of pregnant women between the adverse outcome group and no adverse outcome group, between antibody positive during pregnancy group and the pre-pregnancy antibody positive group were compared. Results: (1) Most of the pregnant women with positive anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies were diagnosed as undifferentiated connective tissue disease, accounting for 40.4% (55/136), followed by Sjogren's syndrome (25.0%, 34/136), systemic lupus erythematosus (23.5%, 32/136), antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (6.6%, 9/136), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (1.5%, 2/136), and 4 cases were not diagnosed. (2) The titers of anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies in the first trimester and the second trimester were compared, and there were no statistical significances (all P>0.05). (3) The proportion of high level anti-Ro/SSA antibody (>100 kU/L), positive level of anti-La/SSB antibody and positive rate of anti-La/SSB antibody in the adverse outcome group were higher than those in the no adverse outcome group, and the birth weight of newborns and live birth rate in the adverse outcome group were lower than that in the no adverse outcome group, all with statistical significances (all P<0.05). The anti-Ro/SSA antibody level, the proportion of drug treatment (hydroxychloroquine, glucocorticoid, gamma globulin), the incidence of fetal growth restriction (FGR), the rate of preterm birth, and the positive level of anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies in newborns were compared between the two groups, and there were no statistically significant differences (all P>0.05). (4) The anti-Ro/SSA antibody level of pregnant women in the pre-pregnancy antibody positive group, the proportion of hydroxychloroquine and glucocorticoid treatment, and the anti-Ro/SSA antibody positive rate of newborns were higher, while the incidence of FGR and gamma globulin treatment rate of newborns in the antibody positive during pregnancy group were higher, respectively, and the differences were statistically significant (all P<0.05). The levels of anti-La/SSB antibodies in pregnant women, anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies in newborns, the positive rate of anti-La/SSB antibodies in newborns and the incidence of adverse outcomes were compared between the antibody positive during pregnancy group and the pre-pregnancy antibody positive group, and there were no statistical significances (all P>0.05). Conclusions: High concentrations of anti-Ro/SSA antibodies and co-positive anti-La/SSB antibodies during pregnancy may increase the incidence of adverse neonatal outcomes. There is no significant difference in the incidence of adverse neonatal outcomes between antibody positive pregnant women and antibody positive pregnant women who were first found during pregnancy after comprehensive treatment in the rheumatology and immunology department.",no,no,no,human non-RCT,safety,,,0

Heterophile antibodies (HAbs) may interfere during immunometric assay measurements and result in falsely high CT levels and different markers. A 50-year-old female patient was referred to our institution for elevated CT levels (3,199 pg/mL [0-11,5]). Physical examination and thyroid ultrasonography show no thyroid nodules. Because of the discrepancy between the clinical picture and the laboratory results, various markers and hormones were examined to determine whether there was any interference in the immunometric assay. Thyroglobulin (Tg) and Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels were also found inaccurately elevated. After precipitation with polyethylene glycol, CT, Tg, and ACTH levels markedly decreased, showing macro-aggregates. Also, serial dilutions showed non-linearity in plasma concentrations. Additionally, CT samples were pretreated with a heterophilic blocking tube before measuring, and the CT level decreased to < 0.1 pg/mL, suggesting a HAb presence. Immunoassay interference should be considered when conflicting laboratory data are observed.

2023-11-28,37218135,Peak Serum Cortisol Cutoffs to Diagnose Adrenal Insufficiency Across Different Cortisol Assays in Children.,"Current peak serum cortisol cutoffs for the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency (AI) after Cosyntropin stimulation have been established using polyclonal antibody (pAb) immunoassays. However, new and highly specific cortisol monoclonal antibody (mAb) immunoassays are being used more widely, which can potentially yield higher false positive rates. Thus, this study aimed to redefine the biochemical diagnostic cutoff points for AI in children when using a highly specific cortisol mAb immunoassay and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS) to avoid unnecessary steroid use.Cortisol levels from 36 children undergoing 1 mcg Cosyntropin stimulation tests to rule out AI were measured using pAb immunoassay (Roche Elecsys Cortisol I), mAB immunoassay (Roche Elecsys Cortisol II), and LC/MS. Logistic regression was used to predict AI using the pAB as the reference standard. A receiver operator characteristic curve, area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and kappa agreement were also calculated.Using a peak serum cortisol cutoff value of 12.5 μg/dL for the mAb immunoassay provided 99% sensitivity and 94% specificity for diagnosing AI, when compared to the historical pAb immunoassay cutoff of 18 μg/dL (AUC=0.997). Likewise, a cutoff of value of 14 μg/dL using the LC/MS, provided 99% sensitivity and 88% specificity when compared to the pAb immunoassay (AUC=0.995).To prevent overdiagnosis of AI in children undergoing 1 mcg Cosyntropin stimulation test, our data support using a new peak serum cortisol cutoff of 12.5 μg/dL and 14 μg/dL to diagnose AI when using mAb immunoassays and LC/MS in children, respectively.",no,no,no,human non-RCT,diagnostic,,,0
2023-11-28,37358001,Serum 21-Deoxycortisol for Diagnosis of Nonclassic Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia in Women With Androgen Excess.,"Nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NCCAH) requires exclusion before diagnosing polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Increasing use of liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) necessitates revision of immunoassay-based criteria for NCCAH. Measurement of 21-deoxycortisol (21DF) may simplify the diagnosis of heterozygosity (HTZ), the presence of 1 affected CYP21A2 allele, which currently relies on complex molecular studies.We aimed to determine LC-MS/MS-specific criteria for NCCAH and HTZ and compare the diagnostic accuracy of 21DF and 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP).A cross-sectional study involving 99 hyperandrogenic females was performed. We identified females who had undergone both a synacthen stimulation test (SST) and CYP21A2 genotyping from 2010 to 2017, and prospectively recruited females referred for an SST to investigate hyperandrogenic symptoms from 2017 to 2021. Steroids were compared between genetically confirmed NCCAH, HTZ, and PCOS. Optimal 17OHP and 21DF thresholds for HTZ and NCCAH were determined by receiver operating characteristic analysis.Basal 17OHP, stimulated 17OHP, and 21DF were measured in 99, 85, and 42 participants, respectively. Optimal thresholds for NCCAH were 3.0 nmol/L and 20.7 nmol/L for basal and stimulated 17OHP, respectively. Basal and stimulated 21DF thresholds of 0.31 nmol/L and 13.3 nmol/L provided 100% sensitivity with specificities of 96.8% and 100% for NCCAH, respectively. Diagnostic thresholds for HTZ of 8.0 nmol/L, 1.0 nmol/L, and 13.6 for stimulated 17OHP, 21DF, and the ratio (21DF + 17OHP)/cortisol each provided 100% sensitivity with specificities of 80.4%, 90.5%, and 85.0%, respectively.LC-MS/MS-specific 17OHP thresholds for NCCAH are lower than those based on immunoassay.

Right atrial (RA) specimens were collected from these models. Additionally, 28 AF patients and ten age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers underwent 18F-FAPI PET/CT imaging.RA of AF beagles showed increased 18F-FAPI uptake. Among AF patients, 18 out of 28 (64.3%) exhibited enhanced atrial FAPI activity. No atrial 18F-FAPI uptake was observed in the sham beagle and healthy volunteers. In animal RA specimens, 18F-FAPI activity correlated positively with FAP mRNA (r = .98, P = .002) and protein (r = .82, P = .03) levels, as well as collagen I mRNA expression (r = .85, P = .02). B-type natriuretic peptide levels were associated with atrial 18F-FAPI activity (OR = 3.01, P = .046).This proof-of-concept study suggests that 18F-FAPI PET/CT imaging may be a feasible method for evaluating activated fibroblasts in the atria of AF patients.",no,no,no,animal,biomarker,,,0

2023-11-28,37922698,Superoxide dismutase A (SodA) is a c-di-GMP effector protein governing oxidative stress tolerance in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.,"C-di-GMP is a bacterial second messenger implicated in the regulation of many key functions including antibiotic tolerance and biofilm formation. Our understanding of how c-di-GMP exerts its action via receptors to modulate different biological functions is still limited. Here we used a c-di-GMP affinity pull-down assay coupled to LC-MS/MS to identify c-di-GMP-binding proteins in the opportunistic pathogen Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. This analysis identified Smlt3238 (SodA), a protein of the superoxide dismutase family, as a c-di-GMP-binding protein. Microscale thermophoresis showed that purified SodA protein bound c-di-GMP with an estimated dissociation constant (Kd) value of 141.5 μM. Using various in vivo and in vitro experiments, we demonstrated that c-di-GMP modulates the enzyme activity of SodA directly. Circular dichroism experiments revealed that SodA protein gradually altered its basic structure with increasing levels of c-di-GMP. Phenotypic experiments conducted in the presence of a range of intracellular c-di-GMP levels showed that SodA function is modulated by c-di-GMP. The findings thus identify a novel c-di-GMP binding protein that governs oxidative stress tolerance in S. maltophilia.",no,no,no,in vitro,biomarker,,,0
2023-11-28,37924449,Novel pathogenic WHRN variant causing hearing loss in a moroccan family.,"The most prevalent sensory disease in humans is deafness. A variety of genes have been linked to hearing loss, which can either be isolated (non-syndromic) or associated with lesions in other organs (syndromic). It has been discovered that WHRN variants are responsible for non-syndromic hearing loss and Usher syndrome type II.Exome sequencing in a consanguineous Moroccan patient with severe hearing loss identified a single homozygous mutation c.619G > T; p.Ala207Ser in WHRN, encoding a cytoskeletal scaffold protein that binds membrane protein complexes to the cytoskeleton in ocular photoreceptors and ear hair cell stereocilia. Bioinformatics methods and molecular dynamic modeling were able to predict the pathogenic implications of this variation.We used whole exome sequencing to find a homozygous WHRN gene variant in a Moroccan family. Numerous bioinformatics methods predict that this modification might result in a change in the WHRN protein's structure.",no,no,no,other,biomarker,,,0
2023-11-28,37929782,Genome-Wide Association Study of Cardiovascular Resilience Identifies Protective Variation in the ,"Background The risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) increases sharply with age. Some older individuals, however, remain unaffected despite high predicted risk. These individuals may carry cardioprotective genetic variants that contribute to resilience. Our aim was to assess whether asymptomatic older individuals without prevalent ASCVD carry cardioprotective genetic variants that contribute to ASCVD resilience. Methods and Results We performed a genome-wide association study using a 10-year predicted ASCVD risk score as a quantitative trait, calculated only in asymptomatic older individuals aged ≥70 years without prevalent ASCVD. Our discovery genome-wide association study of N=12 031 ASCVD event-free individuals from the ASPREE (Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly) trial identified 2 independent variants, rs9939224 (P<5×10-8) and rs56156922 (P<10-6), in the CETP (cholesteryl ester transfer protein) gene. The CETP gene is a regulator of plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and lipoprotein(a) levels, and it is a therapeutic drug target. The associations were replicated in the UK Biobank (subpopulation of N=13 888 individuals aged ≥69 years without prevalent ASCVD). Carriers of the identified CETP variants (versus noncarriers) had higher plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, lower plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and reduced risk of incident ASCVD events during follow-up. Expression quantitative trait loci analysis predicted the identified CETP variants reduce CETP gene expression across various tissues. Previously reported associations between genetic CETP inhibition and increased risk of age-related macular degeneration were not observed among the 3917 ASPREE trial participants with retinal imaging and genetic data available. Conclusions Common genetic variants in the CETP gene region are associated with cardiovascular resilience during aging.

2023-11-29,37611275,High- and intermediate-risk susceptibility variants in melanoma families from the Mediterranean area: A multicentre cohort from the MelaNostrum Consortium.,"Most of large epidemiological studies on melanoma susceptibility have been conducted on fair skinned individuals (US, Australia and Northern Europe), while Southern European populations, characterized by high UV exposure and dark-skinned individuals, are underrepresented.We report a comprehensive pooled analysis of established high- and intermediate-penetrance genetic variants and clinical characteristics of Mediterranean melanoma families from the MelaNostrum Consortium.Pooled epidemiological, clinical and genetic (CDKN2A, CDK4, ACD, BAP1, POT1, TERT, and TERF2IP and MC1R genes) retrospective data of melanoma families, collected within the MelaNostrum Consortium in Greece, Italy and Spain, were analysed. Univariate methods and multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association of variants with characteristics of families and of affected and unaffected family members. Subgroup analysis was performed for each country.We included 839 families (1365 affected members and 2123 unaffected individuals). Pathogenic/likely pathogenic CDKN2A variants were identified in 13.8% of families. The strongest predictors of melanoma were ≥2 multiple primary melanoma cases (OR 8.1; 95% CI 3.3-19.7), >3 affected members (OR 2.6; 95% CI 1.3-5.2) and occurrence of pancreatic cancer (OR 4.8; 95% CI 2.4-9.4) in the family (AUC 0.76, 95% CI 0.71-0.82). We observed low frequency variants in POT1 (3.8%), TERF2IP (2.5%), ACD (0.8%) and BAP1 (0.3%). MC1R common variants (≥2 variants and ≥2 RHC variants) were associated with melanoma risk (OR 1.4; 95% CI 1.0-2.0 and OR 4.3; 95% CI 1.2-14.6, respectively).Variants in known high-penetrance genes explain nearly 20% of melanoma familial aggregation in Mediterranean areas.

2023-11-29,37702348,Missed opportunities in the diagnosis of heart failure: a real-world assessment.,"Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of hospitalization worldwide. An early HF diagnosis is key to reducing hospitalizations. We used electronic health records (EHRs) to characterize HF pathways at the primary care physician (PCP) level prior to a first HF hospitalization (hHF). This study aimed to identify missed opportunities for HF diagnosis and management at the PCP level before a first hHF.This cohort study used EHRs of a large health care organization in Portugal. Patients with incident hHF between 2017 and 2020 were identified. Missed opportunities were defined by the absence of any of the following work-up in the 6 months after signs or symptoms had been recorded: lab results and electrocardiogram, natriuretic peptides, echocardiogram, referral to HF specialist, or HF medication initiation. A total of 2436 patients with a first hHF were identified. The median (interquartile range) age at the time of hospitalization was 81 (14) years, and 1361 (56%) were women. Most patients were treated with cardiovascular drugs prior or at index event. A total of 720 (30%) patients had records of HF signs or symptoms, 94% (n = 674) within 6 months prior to hHF. Among patients with recorded HF signs or symptoms, 410 (57%) had clinical management considered adequate before signs and symptoms were recorded. Of the 310 remaining patients, 155 (50%) had a follow-up that was considered inadequate.Relatively few patients with a first hHF had primary care records of signs or symptoms prior to admission. Of these, nearly half had inadequate management considering diagnosis and treatment. These data suggest the need to improve PCP HF awareness.",no,no,no,human non-RCT,effectiveness,,,0
2023-11-29,37705352,"Incidence, mortality, and predictors of acute kidney injury in patients with heart failure: a systematic review.","Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in patients with heart failure (HF), but studies have been inconsistent about the incidence of AKI in patients with HF. We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the incidence of AKI and its impact on mortality in patients with HF. We also looked at inpatient variables that could predict the development of AKI to identify potential risk factors, so that these can be used as a starting point for intervention and prevention in this group. The Embase, Medline, PubMed, Cochrane libraries, and Web of Science databases were used for searching articles from the inception of the database to October 2022. The EndNote software was used for screening. Meta-analysis was performed using Stata 16.0 software to combine effect sizes. A total of 37 studies were included. Of all the 3 533 583 patients with HF, 774 887 had AKI, with a pooled incidence of 33% [95% confidence interval (CI): 32-35%]. The incidence rate of AKI in acute HF and chronic HF was 36% (95% CI: 31-40%) and 30% (95% CI: 24-35%), respectively. Eleven studies found that AKI patients had higher in-hospital mortality than non-AKI patients [risk ratio (RR): 3.65; 95% CI: 3.04-4.39, P < 0.001]. Mortality was assessed in five studies, and it was found that mortality remained high at 1-year follow-up after onset of AKI (RR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.54-2.22, P < 0.001). Fifteen admission variables were included and analysed in 13 studies. The combined results showed that diabetes, hypertension, history of chronic kidney disease, chronic HF systolic, age, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, creatinine > 1.0 mg/dL, index estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 , blood urea nitrogen > 24 mg/dL, intravenous dobutamine, and serum albumin were predictor factors for HF patients with AKI (P < 0.05). In this meta-analysis, AKI occurred in approximately 33% of HF patients during hospitalization and the risk of dying in the hospital was tripled. Even during 1-year long-term follow-up, the risk of death remained high, and multiple inpatient variables showed that HF patients tended to have AKI. Early intervention and treatment are important to reduce the incidence of AKI and improve the prognosis.",no,no,yes,human non-RCT,"effectiveness, safety, biomarker",,,0
2023-11-29,38012788,Genetic alterations that deregulate RB and PDGFRA signaling pathways drive tumor progression in IDH2-mutant astrocytoma.,"In IDH-mutant astrocytoma, IDH2 mutation is quite rare and biological mechanisms underlying tumor progression in IDH2-mutant astrocytoma remain elusive. Here, we report a unique case of IDH2 mutant astrocytoma, CNS WHO grade 3 that developed tumor progression. We performed a comprehensive genomic and epigenomic analysis for primary and recurrent tumors and found that both tumors harbored recurrent IDH2R172K and TP53R248W mutation with CDKN2A/B hemizygous deletion. We also found amplifications of CDK4 and MDM2 with PDGFRA gain in the recurrent tumor and upregulated protein expressions of these genes. We further developed, for the first time, a xenograft mouse model of IDH2R172K and TP53R248W mutant astrocytoma from the recurrent tumor, but not from the primary tumor. Consistent with parent recurrent tumor cells, amplifications of CDK4 and MDM2 and PDGFRA gain were found, while CDKN2A/B was identified as homozygous deletion in the xenografts, qualifying for integrated diagnosis of astrocytoma, IDH2-mutant, CNS WHO grade 4. Cell viability assay found that CDK4/6 inhibitor and PDGFR inhibitor potently decreased cell viability in recurrent tumor cells, as compared to primary tumor cells. These findings suggest that gene alterations that activate retinoblastoma (RB) signaling pathways and PDGFR may drive tumor progression and xenograft formation in IDH2-mutant astrocytoma, which is equivalent to progressive IDH1-mutant astrocytoma. Also, our findings suggest that these genomic alterations may represent therapeutic targets in IDH2-mutant astrocytoma.",no,no,no,animal,"effectiveness, biomarker",,,0
2023-11-29,38012795,Effects of a single dose of amisulpride on functional brain changes during reward- and motivation-related processing using task-based fMRI in healthy subjects and patients with major depressive disorder - study protocol for a randomized clinical trial.,"Anhedonia and other deficits in reward- and motivation-related processing in psychiatric patients, including patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), represent a high unmet medical need. Neurobiologically, these deficits in MDD patients are mainly associated with low dopamine function in a frontostriatal network. In this study, alterations in brain activation changes during reward processing and at rest in MDD patients compared with healthy subjects are explored and the effects of a single low dose of the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist amisulpride are investigated.This is a randomized, controlled, double-blind, single-dose, single-center parallel-group clinical trial to assess the effects of a single dose of amisulpride (100 mg) on blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) responses during reward- and motivation-related processing in healthy subjects (n = 60) and MDD patients (n = 60). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), BOLD responses are assessed during the monetary incentive delay (MID) task (primary outcome). Exploratory outcomes include BOLD responses and behavioral measures during the MID task, instrumental learning task, effort-based decision-making task, social incentive delay task, and probabilistic reward task as well as changes in resting state functional connectivity and cerebral blood flow.This study broadly covers all aspects of reward- and motivation-related processing as categorized by the National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain Criteria and is thereby an important step towards precision psychiatry. Results regarding the immediate effects of a dopaminergic drug on deficits in reward- and motivation-related processing not only have the potential to significantly broaden our understanding of underlying neurobiological processes but might eventually also pave the way for new treatment options.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05347199. April 12, 2022.",no,no,no,human RCT,"effectiveness, biomarker",,,0
2023-11-29,38014545,Balloon dilation and transient stenting of unilateral membranous choanal atresia in a British Shorthair cat with chronic purulent rhinitis and ascending meningoencephalitis.,"Choanal atresia is a rare congenital anomaly in humans and animals, characterized by the absence of communication of one or both nasal cavities with the nasopharynx. The severity of clinical signs depends on the presence of unilateral versus bilateral stenosis as well as comorbidities. With bilateral atresia, respiration may be severely compromised particularly during sleep, as airflow can only occur when breathing through the open mouth. Various therapeutic modalities have been described in people and adopted for animals. All treatments may be associated with complications, the most important being post-therapeutic scar formation with re-stenosis. This report describes a 10-month-old British Shorthair cat with chronic unilateral serosal nasal discharge that changed to mucopurulent discharge. When acute neurological signs developed, the cat was presented to the veterinary hospital. A diagnosis of primary, membranous right sided choanal atresia was achieved via computed tomography (CT) and nasopharyngeal (posterior) rhinoscopy. Secondary changes included destructive rhinitis with progression to the CNS with a subdural empyema and meningoencephalitis. Retinal changes and aspiration bronchopneumonia were suspected additional complications. After recovery from the secondary infections, the membranous obstruction was perforated and dilated using a valvuloplasty balloon by an orthograde transnasal approach under endoscopic guidance from a retroflexed nasopharyngeal view. To prevent re-stenosis, a foley catheter was placed as a transient stent for 6 days. The cat recovered uneventfully and was asymptomatic after the stent removal. Endoscopic re-examination after 5 months confirmed a persistent opening and patency of the generated right choanal passage. The cat remains asymptomatic 10 months after the procedure. Transnasal endoscopic balloon dilation and transient stenting of choanal atresia is a minimally invasive and relatively simple procedure with potentially sustained success.",no,no,no,animal,"effectiveness, safety",,,0

There was an urgent need to explore an effect biomarker for predicting MACE in elderly patients receiving hip fracture surgery.This study focused on an age-related miRNA, miR-409-3p, and assessed its significance in elderly hip fracture patients.A total of 267 hip fracture patients were enrolled in this study including 104 elderly patients (age ≥ 60 years). All patients were followed up for 1 year to monitor the occurrence of MACE. The risk factors for the occurrence of MACE were evaluated by the logistic regression analysis.Elderly age and reduced cardiac and renal function were identified as risk factors for MACE in hip fracture patients. Elderly patients also showed a high incidence of MACE. In elderly hip fracture patients, significant upregulation of miR-409-3p was observed, which was associated with patients' elderly age, higher level of revised cardiac risk index (RCRI), lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and higher levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), and high sensitivity troponin I (hsTnI).
