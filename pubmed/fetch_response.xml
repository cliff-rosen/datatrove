Infectious complications following colorectal surgery in IBD are significant, particularly in high-risk patients.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="AIM" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">To gather evidence on risk factors associated with increased post-operative infectious complications in IBD and explore management strategies to reduce morbidity and mortality.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">A systematic review adhering to PRISMA-P guidelines was conducted. MEDLINE (PubMed) and Cochrane Library databases were searched using specific keywords. Inclusion criteria encompassed studies involving patients with IBD undergoing abdominal surgery with infectious complications within 30 d postoperatively. Exclusion criteria included patients under 18 years and non-infectious complications. Selected papers were analyzed to identify factors contributing to post-operative infections. A narrative analysis was performed to provide evidence-based recommendations for management. The data were then extracted and assessed based on the <i>Reference Citation Analysis</i> (https://www.referencecitationanalysis.com/).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">The initial database search yielded 1800 articles, with 330 articles undergoing full-text review. After excluding duplicates and irrelevant papers, 35 articles were included for analysis. Risk factors for post-operative complications in patients with IBD included hypoalbuminemia, malnutrition, preoperative abscess, and obesity. Perioperative blood transfusion was associated with increased infectious complications. Medications such as 5-aminosalicylates and immunomodulators did not increase post-operative complications. Corticosteroids were associated with an increased risk of complications. Ustekinumab and vedolizumab showed similar rates of infectious complications compared to other treatments. The impact of minimally invasive surgery on post-operative complications varied across studies.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">In order to reduce post-operative infectious complications in patients with IBD, a comprehensive approach involving multiple disciplines is necessary.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#xa9;The Author(s) 2023.

Patients with Crohn's perianal fistulas (CPF) are affected by fecal incontinence (FI), bleeding, pain, swelling, and purulent perianal discharge, and generally face a higher treatment burden than patients with CD without CPF.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="AIM" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">To gain insights into the burden of illness/quality of life in patients with CPF and their treatment preferences and satisfaction.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">This cross-sectional observational study was conducted in patients with CD aged 21-90 years <i>via</i> a web-enabled questionnaire in seven countries (April-August 2021). Patients were recruited into three cohorts: Cohort 1 included patients without perianal fistulas; cohort 2 included patients with perianal fistulas without fistula-related surgery; and cohort 3 included patients with perianal fistulas and fistula-related surgery. Validated patient-reported outcome measures were used to assess quality of life. Drivers of treatment preferences were measured using a discrete choice experiment (DCE).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">In total, 929 patients were recruited (cohort 1, <i>n</i> = 620; cohort 2, <i>n</i> = 174; cohort 3, <i>n</i> = 135). Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire scores were worse for patients with CPF (cohorts 2 and 3) than for those with CD without CPF (cohort 1): Mean score 3.8 and 3.7 <i>vs</i> 4.1, respectively, (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Similarly, mean Revised FI and FI Quality of Life scores were worse for patients with CPF than for those with CD without CPF. Quality of Life with Anal Fistula scores were similar in patients with CPF with or without CPF-related surgery (cohorts 2 and 3): Mean score 41 and 42, respectively. In the DCE, postoperative discomfort and fistula healing rate were the most important treatment attributes influencing treatment choice: Mean relative importance 35.7 and 24.7, respectively.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The burden of illness in CD is significantly higher for patients with CPF and patients rate lower postoperative discomfort and higher healing rates as the most desirable treatment attributes.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#xa9;The Author(s) 2023.
